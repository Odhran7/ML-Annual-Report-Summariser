the following discussion includes information common to all of danaher’s segments 

materials 

the company’s manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including metallicbased components electronic components chemistries oem products plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas also affect the company’s costs for freight and utilities the company purchases raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components the company utilizes a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to its supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources 

direct and indirect impacts from the covid19 pandemic and other factors have resulted in supply chain disruptions including in some cases shortages of supply cost inflation and shipping delays labor availability constraints and labor cost increases for a number of our businesses especially during the latter part of 2021 our application of dbs tools and processes largely mitigated the impact thereof in 2021 and as a result these constraints did not have a material adverse effect on the business in 2021 however the pressures noted above continue as of the date of this annual report in 2021 certain of our existing suppliers were unable to provide us with the quantity of certain components we required or informed us that they may 

not be able to supply sufficient quantities of certain components in the future and for certain components our supply onhand was limited as of yearend 2021 we are continuing to work with our suppliers to understand the existing and potential future impacts of these trends on our supply chain and we continue to take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts including purchasing components in the open market and qualifying additional suppliers if our suppliers cannot provide us with sufficient quantities of required components there can be no assurance that we will be able to find alternative sources or that alternative sources will be available on terms and prices that are favorable to us any disruption or delay in the supply of necessary components on reasonable terms and prices would adversely impact our business and financial statements in addition higher absentee rates attributable to covid19 among our employees including because of illness quarantines government actions facility closures or other restrictions resulting from covid19 have increased costs to and otherwise adversely impacted certain of our businesses and these impacts may continue due to the speed with which these trends continue to develop and evolve and the uncertainty of their duration we cannot assure you that these factors will not have an adverse impact on our business and financial statements in the future for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for the company’s operations refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

the company owns numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate the company’s intellectual property is important to its operations the company does not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license or any related group of any such items to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time the company engages in litigation to protect its intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to the company’s intellectual property refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher 

competition 

although the company’s businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets the company’s competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of its competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as the company or any of its segments does because of the range of the products and services the company sells and the variety of markets it serves the company encounters a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than it is in particular markets as well as large companies or divisions of large companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities the company is facing increased competition in a number of its served markets as a result of the entry of wellresourced companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations the development of competitive technologies by earlystage and emerging companies and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line management believes that the company has a leadership position in many of the markets it serves key competitive factors vary among the company’s businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality and safety performance delivery speed application expertise service and support technology and innovation distribution network breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition refer to “item 1a risk factors”

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of the company’s revenue in 2021 was from customers other than governmental entities each of danaher’s segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result the company is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements refer to “item 1a risk factors” no material portion of danaher’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government entity 

regulatory matters 

the company faces extensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of its products and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that the company is subject to these are not the only regulations that the company’s businesses must comply 

with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that the company’s businesses are subject to refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical device regulations 

many of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders including but not limited to the us food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the united states to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products many medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries in which they are produced or sold 

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval “pma” before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time 

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained 

any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state and nonus agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to the current good manufacturing practices “cgmp” requirements as set forth in the quality systems regulation “qsr” which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process 

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting “mdr” requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses 

in the eu our products are subject to the medical device and in vitro medical device laws of the various member states which for many years were based on directives of the european commission however in may 2017 the eu adopted new formal regulations to replace such directives specifically the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and in vitro devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance the eu regulations were adopted with staggered transitional periods that have since been updated the full application of the eu mdr became effective in may 2021 while the eu ivdr will be fully applicable in may 2022 regulatory requirements in the united kingdom “uk” are also changing as a result of brexit the uk’s withdrawal from the eu complying with the eu mdr eu ivdr and the evolving regulatory scheme in the uk requires modifications to our 

quality management systems additional resources in certain functions and updates to technical files among other changes which cost 47 million in 2021 and we anticipate will cost approximately 20 million in 2022 

other healthcare laws 

we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and various health care related laws regulating fraud and abuse research and development pricing and sales and marketing practices and the privacy and security of health information including the us federal regulations described below many states foreign countries and supranational bodies have also adopted laws and regulations similar to and in some cases more stringent than the us federal regulations discussed above and below including the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws 

• many of our healthcarerelated products are purchased by healthcare providers that typically bill various thirdparty payers such as governmental healthcare programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable nonus programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result many of our healthcarerelated products are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by the us department of health and human services “hhs” including the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and services including laws and regulations related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and healthcare fraud thirdparty payers are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services and in international markets many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies price ceilings decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for any product or a decision by a thirdparty payor not to cover a product could reduce usage and patient demand for the product 

• the us federal antikickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting offering receiving or providing remuneration including any kickback or bribe directly or indirectly in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

• the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” prohibits knowingly and willfully 1 executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program including private payors or 2 falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits items or services in addition hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 also restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable health information and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information similar to the us federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under hipaa or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

• the false claims act imposes liability on any person or entity that among other things knowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program knowingly makes uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the us federal government the qui tam provisions of the false claims act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery in addition the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the us federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act 

• the federal civil monetary penalties law prohibits among other things the offering or transferring of remuneration to a medicare or medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of medicare or medicaid payable items or services 

• the open payments act requires manufacturers of medical devices covered under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program with specific exceptions to record payments and other transfers of value to a broad range of healthcare providers and teaching hospitals and to report this data as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members to hhs for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level and an increasing number of 

countries either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals 

in addition some of the in vitro diagnostic drugsofabuse assays and reagents sold by the company’s subsidiaries contain small amounts of controlled substances and as a result some of the company’s facilities are inspected periodically by the united states drug enforcement administration to assess whether the company properly handles stores and disposes of controlled substances in the manufacture of those products 

federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers analogous us state laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws also may apply to our business practices including but not limited to research distribution sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including private insurers further there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the us federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa 

for a discussion of risks related to regulation by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and the other regulatory regimes referenced above please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

healthcare reform 

in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs improving quality or expanding access for example in the united states in march 2010 the us patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “ppaca” was signed into law which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry since its enactment there have been judicial congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ppaca and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the ppaca in the future 

moreover there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed among other things to bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products individual states in the united states have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing 

data privacy and security laws 

as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states hipaa privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy in particular the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which came into effect in january 2020 has some of the same features as the gdpr discussed below and has already prompted several other states to enact or consider enacting similar laws the eu general data protection regulation that became effective in may 2018 “gdpr” has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect transmit process and retain personal data including among other things in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities with significant fines for noncompliance several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions for a discussion of risks related to these laws refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

environmental laws and regulations 

for a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that the company’s operations products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

antitrust laws 

the us federal government most us states and many other countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of these laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages 

exportimport compliance 

the company is required to comply with various us exportimport control and economic sanctions laws including 

• the international traffic in arms regulations administered by the us department of state directorate of defense trade controls which among other things imposes license requirements on the export from the united states of defense articles and defense services listed on the us munitions list 

• the export administration regulations administered by the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security which among other things impose licensing requirements on the export incountry transfer and reexport of certain dualuse goods technology and software which are items that have both commercial and military or proliferation applications 

• the regulations administered by the us department of treasury office of foreign assets control which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries governments and persons based on united states foreign policy and national security considerations and 

• the import regulatory activities of the us customs and border protection and other us government agencies 

other nations’ governments have implemented similar exportimport control and economic sanction regulations which may affect the company’s operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions 

in addition under us laws and regulations us companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the united states are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the united states or between the united states and countries outside of the united states if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services violate antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability 

for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

the company’s products and services are available worldwide and its principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia the company also has operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows the company to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides greater stability to its operations allows the company to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers the company an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition the company believes that future growth depends in part on its ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target highgrowth markets 

the manner in which the company’s products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of the company’s sales in nonus markets are made by its subsidiaries located outside the united states though the company also sells directly from the united states into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors and in some cases directly in countries with low sales volumes the company generally sells through representatives and distributors

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec we have identified the risks and uncertainties described below as material but they are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions economic conditions geopolitical events changes in laws regulations or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns including pandemics natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial statements including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition and our stock price 

business and strategic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact certain elements of our business and our financial statements 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 the global spread of covid19 has led to unprecedented restrictions on and disruptions in business and personal activities including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses our communities and governments are taking to mitigate the spread for example national state and local governments have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions including quarantines border closures increased border controls travel restrictions shelter in place orders shutdowns governmentordered vaccine mandates and other measures these measures can disrupt normal business operations and can have significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide 

the direct impact of covid19 and the preventive and precautionary measures implemented as a result thereof have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect certain elements of our company including to a different degree our operations commercial organizations supply chains and distribution systems please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of how covid19 impacted our results of operations and financial position in 2021 without limiting the foregoing we have experienced andor may in the future experience 

• constraints on the movement of our products through the supply chain 

• capacity constraints and price increases in our own supply chain including with respect to freight services 

• adverse impacts on our workforce andor key employees including labor availability 

• adverse impacts on customer orders and purchases and unpredictable reductions in demand for our products 

• adverse impacts on our collections of accounts receivable including delays in collections and increases in uncollectible receivables 

• unpredictable increases in demand for certain products and 

• increased cybersecurity attack activity 

while the pandemic continues we may experience continued adverse impacts on certain elements of our business and financial statements even to the extent covid19 conditions begin to improve the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts andor the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by 

geography and line of business the actions danaher’s businesses take in response to any improvements in conditions may vary widely by geography and line of business and will likely be made with incomplete information pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature incorrect or insufficient and could have an adverse impact on our business and financial statements 

please see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of the company products that are being used in the fight against covid19 in an effort to optimize availability of needed medical and other supplies and products in connection with the pandemic we may elect to or governments may require us or our customers to allocate manufacturing capacity for example pursuant to the us defense production act “dpa” in a way that adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations results in differential treatment of customers andor adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships for example certain of our customers are or have been subject to dpa requirements relating to the production of covid19 related products and have required certain of our businesses to also comply with these requirements under our supply agreements please also see the risk factor titled “the us government has certain rights with respect to incremental production capacity andor the intellectual property we have developed using government financing” for a discussion of the us government’s rights in connection with funding they have provided certain of our businesses to finance capacity expansion for the production of certain covid19 related products 

in addition the levels of demand for our covid19 related products can exceed our capacity to meet such demand on a timely basis or at all which can result in negative publicity and future competitive disadvantage and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements the accelerated development and production of products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic also increases the risk of regulatory enforcement actions product defects or claims thereof in addition to the extent the covid19 pandemic moderates andor if covid19 vaccination therapeutic or testing practices change and danaher’s offerings are no longer a preferred solution demand for danaher’s covid19 solutions may decline any of these developments may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

conditions in the global economy the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower economic growth in the domestic andor international markets inflation actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment or underemployment labor availability constraints reduced levels of capital expenditures changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade fiscal tax and monetary policies changes in capital requirements for financial institutions government budget negotiation dynamics sequestration austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

• reducing demand for our products and services in this annual report references to products and services also includes software limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies 

• increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

• increasing price competition in our served markets 

• supply interruptions or delays which can disrupt our ability to produce or deliver our products 

• increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets 

• increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which in addition to increasing the risks identified above could result in preference actions against us and 

• adversely impacting market sizes and growth rates 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements can be adversely affected 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce the prices we charge 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors refer to “item 1 business—competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements for example increased demand for products incorporating digital capabilities or more environmentallyfriendly products and supplier practices as well as changes in the way healthcare services are delivered including the movement of some care from acute to nonacute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector particularly in the healthcare industry are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs and improve efficiency and effectiveness in addition significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems safety alerts and publications about products reflecting the competitive significance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in our industry our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses in addition the company’s competitors and customers have from time to time introduced and may in the future introduce private label generic or lowcost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points competitors’ products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall resulting in an adverse effect on the company’s business and financial statements 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial statements will suffer our success depends on several factors including our ability to 

• correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences 

• allocate our rd funding to products and services with higher growth prospects 

• anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization 

• innovate and develop new technologies and applications and acquire or obtain rights to thirdparty technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets 

• obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner price them competitively and costeffectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time 

• obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable as well as achieving thirdparty reimbursement and 

• stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies 

if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in rd of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our business and financial statements even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we often incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice competitors may also develop aftermarket services and parts for our products which may detract from our sales 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce and increase the predictability of costs which can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce and increase the predictability of costs including the following 

• many of our customers and the endusers to whom our customers supply products rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities the ppaca health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or endusers of our products and services andor the volume of medical procedures using our products and services for example the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 “pama” introduced a multiyear pricing program for services payable under the clinical laboratory fee schedule “clfs” that is designed to bring medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers it is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services but to the extent our customers conclude that medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products other countries as well as some private payors also control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations tying reimbursement to outcomes or in the case of governmental entities through compulsory licensing global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement 

• governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services centralizing purchasing limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services payors are also seeking to improve price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases 

these changes as well as other impacts from market demand government regulations thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is delivered reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors heighten clinical data requirements reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

international economic political legal compliance social and business factors can negatively affect our business and financial statements 

in 2021 approximately 62 of our sales were derived from customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the us since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in the highgrowth markets our nonus business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that include 

• public health crises and epidemics such as covid19 

• interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers 

• differences in terms of sale including longer payment terms than are typical in the us 

• local product preferences or requirements 

• changes in a country’s or region’s political legal social or economic conditions such as the devaluation of particular currencies 

• trade protection measures tariffs embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements 

• unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements including changes in tax laws 

• capital controls and limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises 

• changes in local healthcare delivery payment and reimbursement policies and programs 

• complex data privacy and cybersecurity requirements 

• limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights including differing protection of intellectual property 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• workforce instability and differing labor or employment regulations 

• difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis and 

• greater uncertainty risk expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions including with respect to product and other regulatory approvals 

international business risks have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our business and financial statements 

for example in 2021 we generated approximately 13 of our sales from china accordingly our business and financial statements can be adversely influenced by political economic legal compliance social and business conditions in china generally additionally china’s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing sectorspecific policies and it maintains control over china’s economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies further considerable uncertainty exists regarding the longterm effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies including the us and china uncertainty or adverse changes to conditions in china or the policies of china’s government or its laws and regulations can adversely affect the overall economic growth of china or of the particular industries in which we participate and can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our growth can suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets can be limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets can diminish demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business and financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that have experienced and may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes marketing or promotional programs new product introductions the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors any of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial statements in any given period 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development supply and marketing of certain products potential products and technologies and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

for certain of our businesses success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies relying on collaborative relationships is risky because among other things our collaborative partners may 1 not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations 2 fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner 3 be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent 4 compete with us 5 disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship 6 have insufficient capital resources 7 decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms and 8 fail to comply with applicable laws regulatory requirements andor applicable contractual obligations because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected in addition if we or any of our collaborative 

partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

acquisition divestiture and investment risks 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy could negatively impact our business 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our business promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers or investors the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions and investments has resulted and may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments 

our acquisition of businesses investments joint ventures and other strategic relationships can negatively impact our business and financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions refer to mda for additional details acquisitions investments joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including but not limited to the following any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements 

• businesses technologies services and products that we acquire or invest in sometimes underperform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid fail to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or fail to achieve andor sustain profitability 

• we from time to time incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic relationships which can also cause a deterioration of danaher’s credit ratings result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets 

• acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period or over the longterm 

• preclosing and postclosing earnings charges can adversely impact our results in any given period and the impact may be substantially different from periodtoperiod 

• acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address 

• we can experience difficulty in integrating cultures personnel operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers and former employees of businesses we acquire may compete with us 

• we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition investment joint venture or strategic relationship 

• we have assumed and may assume unknown liabilities known contingent liabilities that become realized known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s or investee’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies can increase our expenses adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations 

• in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures we often enter into postclosing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments earnout obligations and indemnification obligations which can have unpredictable financial results 

• as a result of our acquisitions and investments we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets or if the value of our investments declines we are required to incur impairment charges 

• we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners or the companies we invest in and we may not be able to direct or influence the management and operations of the joint venture other strategic relationship or investee in the manner we believe is most appropriate exposing us to additional risk and 

• investing in or making loans to earlystage companies often entails a high degree of risk including uncertainty regarding the company’s ability to successfully develop new technologies and services bring these new technologies and services to market and gain market acceptance maintain adequate capitalization and access to cash or other forms of liquidity and retain critical management personnel we do not always achieve the strategic technological financial or commercial benefits we anticipate we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan or our investment may be illiquid for a greaterthanexpected period of time 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities in addition we obtain or receive the benefits of representations and warranties insurance in connection with certain acquisitions we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions or insurance coverages will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our business and financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have disposed could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest spinoff splitoff or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment for example in 2015 danaher separated and splitoff to danaher shareholders the majority of its former communications business in a reverse morris trust transaction with netscout systems inc the “communications disposition” in 2016 danaher separated and spunoff to danaher shareholders its former test  measurement segment industrial technologies segment excluding the product identification businesses and retailcommercial petroleum business collectively known as “fortive corporation” the “fortive disposition” and in 2019 danaher consummated the separation and initial public offering “ipo” and subsequent splitoff of its dental segment known as envista holdings corporation the “envista disposition” transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions can dilute the company’s earnings per share have other adverse financial tax and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes can arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we or our predecessors have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our business or financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the communications disposition the fortive disposition or the envista disposition could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

with respect to each of the communications disposition the fortive disposition and the envista disposition we entered into a separation agreement and related agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and the relationship between the respective companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party that can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty if we are required to indemnify any of the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between danaher and such other parties and require danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements 

we could incur significant liability if any of the communications disposition the fortive disposition or the envista disposition is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the communications disposition the fortive disposition and the envista disposition qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code these opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the internal revenue service “irs” could determine on audit that any such transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion if any such transaction is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

operational risks 

significant disruptions in or breaches in security of our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are provided andor managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations in addition some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes these systems products and services including those we acquire through business acquisitions can be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance including by employees power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate attacks can also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services or security breaches of thirdparty suppliers we rely on to process store or transmit electronic information can result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers patients or suppliers like most multinational corporations our information technology systems and data have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions the attacks breaches misappropriations and other disruptions and damage described above can interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets result in disclosure of personal data damage customer patient business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy and other laws and increased costs for security and remediation in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial statements our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

in addition our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards evolving customer expectations changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectively address these requirements further a greater number of our employees have been working remotely since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic which exposes us to greater cybersecurity risks 

any inability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches can result in adverse regulatory and business consequences and litigation as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business please see “item 1 business—regulatory matters” for additional information for example entities that are 

found to be in violation of hipaa as the result of a breach of unsecured patient health information a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by hhs may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative fines and penalties andor additional reporting and oversight obligations failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4 of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require some or all personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions a broad california privacy law came into effect in january 2020 with some of the same features as the gdpr which has already prompted other states to enact or consider enacting similar laws government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to customer patient business partner and employee relationships and to our reputation any of which may adversely affect our business and financial statements in addition compliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the us and around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures and may require further changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services or allegations thereof can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to “off label” use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from thirdparties can lead to personal injury death andor property damage and adversely affect our business and financial statements these events can lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants government agencies and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood cyberattack earthquake hurricane power shortage or outage public health crisis including epidemics and pandemics and the reaction thereto war terrorism riot public protest or other natural or manmade disasters such as the covid19 pandemic and the damage caused to our facilities by hurricane maria in puerto rico in 2017 if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services diminish demand damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses 

climate change or legal or regulatory measures to address climate change may negatively affect us 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations physical risk resulting from acute changes such as hurricane tornado wildfire or flooding or chronic changes such as droughts heat waves or sea level changes in climate patterns can adversely impact our facilities and operations and disrupt our supply chains and distribution systems concern over climate change can also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions andor mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment such as taxation of or caps on the use of carbonbased energy any such new or additional legal or regulatory requirements may increase the costs associated with or disrupt sourcing manufacturing and distribution of our products which may adversely affect our business and financial statements in addition any failure to adequately address stakeholder expectations with respect to environmental social and governance “esg” matters may result in the loss of business adverse reputational impacts diluted market valuations and challenges in attracting and retaining customers and talented employees 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our business and financial statements could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials or components cyberattacks natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the fda and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products an alternative manufacturer is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in adverse impacts to our business and financial statements 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our business and financial statements may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services can cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from thirdparties for use in our manufacturing operations including metallicbased components electronic components chemistries oem products plastics and other petroleumbased products our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers from time to time extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities please see “item 1 business—materials” for a discussion of certain supply chain constraints we experienced in 2021 conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our business and financial statements may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance regulatory requirements cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions such as trade protectionism and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors can result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers or cost inefficiencies provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns can adversely affect our business and financial statements the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels also impacts our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries can adversely impact our business and financial statements 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of the supplies that we use in and the labor we need for our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business—materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities as well as for labor have fluctuated significantly in the past please see “item 1 business—materials” for a discussion of the supply chain and labor availability disruptions and constraints our businesses are currently facing and the adverse impacts that we have incurred and may incur relating thereto any sustained interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of key components raw materials other commodities and labor can adversely affect our business and financial statements in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to when supply and labor prices rise we are not always able to pass along cost increases through higher prices for our products if we are unable to fully recover higher supply and labor costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs our margins and profitability could decline and our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our success depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate talented employees representing diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets 

the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industries particularly in the areas of science and technology is extremely competitive in addition in 2021 a number of our businesses faced certain labor availability constraints and labor cost inflation if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain and motivate highly skilled workers and key leaders representing diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets our business and financial statements may be adversely affected 

our restructuring actions can have longterm adverse effects on our business and financial statements 

we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and can slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention in addition delays or failures in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements on the anticipated timeline or at all may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

certain of our us and nonus employees are subject to collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes that could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

intellectual property risks 

if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or if thirdparties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the united states 

many of the markets we serve are technologydriven and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing in some circumstances enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that 

others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that thirdparties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage and adequately protect our intellectual property our failure to detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights each can adversely impact our business and financial statements 

these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information intellectual property technology and other assets comparable to the united states the risks we encounter in such countries include but are not limited to the following 

• joint ventures that we participate in can include restrictions that could compromise our control over the intellectual property technology and proprietary information of the joint venture 

• as we expand our operations globally increasing amounts of our data intellectual property and technology is used and stored in countries outside the united states and regulations in certain countries require data to be stored locally these factors increase the risk that such data intellectual property and technology could be stolen or otherwise compromised 

• certain of our products have been counterfeited and we may encounter additional andor increased levels of counterfeiting in the future 

• governmental entities may adopt regulations or other requirements that give them rights to certain of our intellectual property technology andor proprietary information such as through compulsory licensing or ownership restrictions or requirements 

• in certain countries we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property rights as we do in the us 

• governmental regulations relating to state secrecy or other topics limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdictions and 

• risks costs and challenges of operating in a particular jurisdiction can result in a decision to relocate or divert operations to a different jurisdiction potentially at higher cost 

any of these risks can adversely impact our business and financial statements refer to “—international economic political legal compliance social and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements” for a discussion of additional risks relating to our international operations 

thirdparties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties’ intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others disputes or litigations regarding intellectual property can be costly and timeconsuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others be required to cease marketing manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign reengineer or rebrand our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business and financial statements thirdparty intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations when we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others we are not always able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms if at all even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

the us government has certain rights with respect to incremental production capacity andor the intellectual property we have developed using government financing 

certain agencies of the us government such as the biomedical advanced research and development authority “barda” within the us department of health and human services have agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity andor the development of technology at certain of our businesses and our businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future 

in consideration of this financing the us government has certain rights including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion andor rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a governmentfunded program can include a nonexclusive royaltyfree worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us or our licensors as applicable to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a thirdparty if they determine that 1 adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use 2 such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or 3 such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations further government rights include the right to use and disclose without limitation technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense 

we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the administration and performance of our obligations under these agreements including the federal acquisition regulation “far” and agencyspecific regulations supplemental to the far business ethics and public integrity obligations export and import control laws and regulations and regulations and standards relating to our accounting practices in addition if the us government terminates one or more of these contracts with us for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms a negative impact on our business and financial statements could result 

financial and tax risks 

our outstanding debt has increased significantly as a result of acquisitions and we may incur additional debt in the future our existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 222 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to incur approximately 22 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under our credit facilities that were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances our debt level and related debt service obligations as well as the dividend obligations pursuant to our series a and series b mandatory convertible preferred stock “mcps” can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt or dividends on our mcps which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and other investments 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates 

if our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained 

our credit facilities and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets and a requirement under our credit facilities to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity of 065 to 10 or less if we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our business and financial statements including our liquidity if we add new debt in the future the risks described above would increase 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2021 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 640 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates can impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments adversely affect our financial statements in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which can adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices 

decreased strength of the us dollar adversely affects the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening of the us dollar generally results in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency can also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments can affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities can result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in numerous nonus jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” was enacted the tcja significantly revised the us federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate to 210 implementing a quasiterritorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on unremitted cumulative nonus earnings of nonus subsidiaries “transition tax” 

due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the tcja the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities can be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected please refer to mda for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of the factors referenced in the preceding sentence may be substantially different from periodtoperiod 

in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities such as the audits described in mda and the company’s consolidated financial statements if audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our results can be adversely affected any further changes to the tax system in the united states or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of nonus income as further described below could also adversely affect our financial statements 

changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position 

the us congress government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we do business and the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” for which the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan that have been adopted and expanded by many taxing authorities to address perceived tax abuse and inconsistencies between tax jurisdictions as a result the tax laws in the us and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

legal political and economic uncertainty surrounding the exit of the united kingdom from the eu could have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

the uk ceased to be a member state of the eu on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” and the parties have agreed to and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement uncertainties remain regarding the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement and the other potential impacts of brexit such as the impact of new or different laws and regulations as the uk replaces or replicates certain eu laws and trade and tax impacts as the uk negotiates its own tax and trade treaties with countries around the world the impacts from brexit could adversely affect our business and financial statements as of december 31 2021 the company had eight manufacturing facilities in the uk and the company’s net investment in property plant and equipment in the uk was 260 million for the year ended december 31 2021 less than 5 of our sales were derived from customers located in the uk however the impact of brexit could also impact our business and financial statements outside the uk 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees can increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements 

legal regulatory compliance and reputational risks 

significant developments or changes in us laws or policies can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

significant developments or changes in us laws and policies such as laws and policies governing nonus trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate or governing the health care system and drug prices can adversely affect our business and financial statements for example in recent years the us has increased tariffs on certain imported goods and trade tensions between the us and china escalated with each country imposing significant additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country the us and china could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect our access to markets these factors have adversely affected and in the future could further adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems including our code of conduct always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that violate laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance economic and trade sanctions money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct and violations of such code of conduct could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

in addition to the environmental health safety health care medical device anticorruption data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this annual report our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

• we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory in addition we sell and provide products and technology to third parties such as agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to endusers and if any of these third parties do not comply with applicable export or import laws we may incur liability in addition from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures have prevented and will prevent violations of these regulations and any violation can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

• we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities less than 5 of our 2021 sales were made to the us federal government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts our agreements with government entities are in some cases subject to termination reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements reductions in federal spending and other factors and we may underestimate our costs of performing 

under the contract in certain cases a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process can become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder which could result in loss of the contract we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts 

these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and can be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations can result in import detentions fines damages civil and administrative penalties injunctions consent decrees suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts disbarment from selling to certain governmental agencies or exclusion from government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of noncompliance disruption of our business limitation on our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services loss of customers significant legal and investigatory fees disgorgement individual imprisonment reputational harm contractual damages diminished profits curtailment or restricting of business operations criminal prosecution and other monetary and nonmonetary penalties compliance with these and other regulations can also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules can result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements for additional information regarding these risks refer to “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

we are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements

from time to time we become aware through our internal audits and other internal control procedures employees or other parties of possible compliance matters such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting internal controls financial reporting auditing or ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws when we become aware of such possible compliance matters we investigate internally and take what we believe to be appropriate corrective action internal investigations can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal or regulatory proceedings against us and adversely affect our business and financial statements 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the fda by other federal and state governmental agencies by comparable agencies of other countries and regions by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugsofabuse or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulations please see “item 1 business—regulatory matters” for more information failure to meet these requirements can adversely impact our business and financial statements in the applicable geographies 

to varying degrees these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance such as 510k clearance or approvals for our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained even after initial regulatory clearance or approval we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use which could reduce the product’s market acceptance we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse research and development pricing and sales and marketing practices the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards including the federal regulations described in “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

government authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations agency guidance or case law failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of laws or regulations failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share remediation and increased compliance costs recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products fines expenses injunctions civil penalties criminal penalties consent decrees administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance suspension or withdrawal of approvals premarket notification rescissions and other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements” further defending against any such actions can be costly and timeconsuming and may require significant personnel resources therefore even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us our business may be impaired ensuring that our operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs 

our products can be subject to human clinical trials the results of which may be unexpected or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or a regulator’s or the market’s perception of these clinical data can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements 

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties 

the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products in particular any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the intended uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda or any other federal state or nonus regulator determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we can be subject to exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements” any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements 

certain modifications to our products may require new 510k clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products 

once a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the united states pursuant to a 510k clearance or a premarket approval “pma” a manufacturer may be required to notify the fda of certain modifications to the device similar requirements apply in other jurisdictions manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510k clearance or premarket submission but the fda may review any manufacturer’s decision the fda may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary we have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable fda regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510k clearances or other premarket submissions were not required we may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new clearance or approval if the fda disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510k notifications or pma applications we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance and we may be subject to civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the health and safety of our employees the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites chemical constituents in products and endoflife disposal and takeback programs for products sold we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire have been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws can result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or financial statements 

in addition we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we can also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks refer to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we have as of the date of this annual report we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2021 will have a material effect on our business or financial statements 

changes in governmental regulations can reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs and privacy we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations these 

regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change in any of these regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof can reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or restrict our existing activities products and services for example a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies changes in the fda’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process can have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations can adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines can result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from periodtoperiod 

exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose their preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated bylaws the “bylaws” provide that unless the company selects or consents to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting any internal corporate claims to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements will be the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have or declines to accept jurisdiction another state court or a federal court located within the state of delaware collectively “delaware courts” current and former stockholders are deemed to have consented to the personal jurisdiction of the delaware courts in connection with any action to enforce such exclusive forum provision and to service of process in any such action these provisions of the bylaws are not a waiver of and do not relieve anyone of duties to comply with federal securities laws including those specifying the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts under the exchange act and concurrent jurisdiction of federal and state courts under the securities act of 1933 as amended to the extent that the exclusive forum provisions of our bylaws limit a current or former stockholder’s ability to select a judicial forum other than the delaware courts they might discourage the specified legal actions might cause current or former stockholders to incur additional litigationrelated expenses and might result in outcomes unfavorable to current or former stockholders alternatively a court might determine that these provisions of the bylaws are inapplicable or unenforceable in any particular action in which case we may incur additional litigationrelated expenses in such action and the action may result in outcomes unfavorable to us which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial statements

company’s businesses on an overall basis demand for the company’s products and services increased on a yearoveryear basis in 2021 as compared to 2020 and together with the company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other businessspecific factors contributed to the core sales growth discussed below as the conditions related to the pandemic improved in many geographies in 2021 compared to 2020 the company generally experienced increased demand in the endmarkets it serves in addition to the improving pandemic conditions development and production related to covid19 vaccines and therapeutics among biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers continued to generate strong demand for bioprocessing and genomic products in the company’s life sciences segment and covid19 related testing generated strong demand primarily in the company’s molecular diagnostics testing business in the diagnostics segment and in the company’s flow cytometry genomics lab automation centrifugation particle counting and characterization business and the genomics consumables business in the life sciences segment geographically both highgrowth and developed markets contributed to yearoveryear core sales growth during 2021 core sales in developed markets grew more than 20 in 2021 as compared to 2020 and were driven by north america and western europe core sales in highgrowth markets grew approximately 30 in 2021 as compared to 2020 with broadbased growth across these markets led by growth in china highgrowth markets represented approximately 31 of the company’s total sales in 2021

the covid19 pandemic 

the global spread of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 has led to unprecedented restrictions on and disruptions in business and personal activities including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses our communities and governments have taken and are taking to mitigate the spread of the virus and to manage its impact the company continues to actively monitor the pandemic including the current spread of certain variants of the virus and has taken and intends to continue taking steps to identify and seek to mitigate the adverse impacts on and risks to the company’s business including but not limited to its employees customers business partners manufacturing capabilities and capacity and supply and distribution channels posed by the spread of covid19 and the governmental and community responses thereto the company’s businesses have activated their business continuity plans as a result of this pandemic including taking steps in an effort to help keep our workforce healthy and safe and are assessing and updating those plans on an ongoing basis as a result of covid19 the company’s businesses have modified certain of their respective business practices and the company expects to take such further actions as may be required by government authorities or as determined to be in the best interests of our employees customers and other business partners the company has developed and is implementing returntoworkplace protocols designed to help ensure the health and safety of its employees customers and business partners for its businesses to apply as appropriate given that the prevalence of covid19 and the nature of the response thereto including the degree to which restrictions are being relaxed or reimposed varies significantly by geography the impact of the pandemic on the company’s different business locations around the world at any given time also varies significantly 

we are also deploying our capabilities expertise and scale to address the critical health needs related to covid19 we have developed and made available diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of covid19 in addition our businesses are providing critical support to firms that are developing and producing vaccines and therapies for covid19 among other support 

while we expect overall demand for the company’s covid19 related products to moderate as and to the extent the pandemic subsides as the pandemic evolves toward endemic status we believe a level of demand for the company’s products that support covid19 related vaccines and therapeutics including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar future pandemics and covid19 testing will continue however on a relative basis we expect the level of ongoing demand for products supporting covid19 testing will be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting covid19 related vaccines and therapeutics the company’s ability to satisfy covid19 related demand will also depend in part upon the expansion of our production capacity in these areas 

due to the speed with which the covid19 situation continues to evolve the global breadth of its spread the range of governmental and community responses thereto and our geographic and business line diversity its further impact on our 

business remains highly uncertain but may be materially negative to certain elements of our business the potential negative impact will depend on future developments including but not limited to 

• the degree of spread and severity of covid19 variants such as omicron and 

• the timing and durability of continued recovery in the global demand for our noncovid19 related products and services

acquisitions 

on august 30 2021 the company acquired aldevron llc “aldevron” for a cash purchase price of approximately 96 billion the “aldevron acquisition” aldevron manufactures highquality plasmid dna mrna and proteins serving biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers across research clinical and commercial applications and is now part of the company’s life sciences segment aldevron generated revenues of approximately 300 million in 2020 the acquisition of aldevron is expected to provide additional sales and earnings opportunities for the company by expanding product line diversity including new product offerings supporting genomic medicine the company financed the aldevron acquisition using cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper 

in addition to the aldevron acquisition during 2021 the company acquired 13 other businesses for total consideration of approximately 14 billion in cash net of cash acquired the businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the company’s three segments the aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately 100 million

results of operations 

in this report references to the nongaap measures of core sales also referred to as core revenues or salesrevenues from existing businesses and core sales including cytiva refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 

• sales from acquired businesses as defined below as applicable and 

• the impact of currency translation 

references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit during the applicable period attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations provided that in calculating core sales including cytiva cytiva’s sales net of the sales of the company product lines divested in 2020 to obtain regulatory approval to acquire cytiva or the “divested product lines” “cytiva sales” are excluded from the definition of sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between 

• the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses as defined above as applicable and 

• the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses as defined above as applicable after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period 

as noted above beginning with results for the second quarter of 2020 the company also presents core sales on a basis that includes cytiva sales prior to the acquisition of cytiva danaher calculated core sales solely on a basis that excluded sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition however given cytiva’s significant size and historical core sales growth rate in each case compared to danaher’s existing businesses management believes it is appropriate to also present core sales on a basis that includes cytiva sales management believes this presentation provides useful information to investors by demonstrating beginning immediately after the acquisition cytiva’s impact on the company’s growth profile rather than waiting to demonstrate such impact until 12 months after the acquisition when cytiva would normally have been included in danaher’s core sales calculation danaher calculates periodtoperiod core sales growth including cytiva by adding cytiva sales to core sales for both the baseline and current periods beginning in the second quarter 

of 2021 cytiva sales are included in core sales and therefore the measure “core sales including cytiva” is no longer provided for quarterly periods beginning with the second quarter of 2021 

core sales growth and the related measure of core sales including cytiva should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting these nongaap financial measures provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to danaher’s peers management also uses these nongaap financial measures to measure the company’s operating and financial performance and uses core sales growth as one of the performance measures in the company’s executive shortterm cash incentive program the company excludes the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and excludes the effect of acquisitions other than cytiva sales in the case of core sales growth including cytiva and divestiturerelated items because the nature size timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from periodtoperiod and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult 

throughout this discussion references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of dbs 

the company deems acquisitionrelated transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant generally relating to the company’s larger acquisitions if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisitionrelated transaction costs typical for danaher in a given period

operating profit performance 

operating profit margins were flat during 2021 as compared to 2020 the following factors impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons 

2021 vs 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by 

• impairment charges related to a trade name and other intangible assets in the first quarter of 2020 and a trade name in the third quarter of 2020  45 basis points 

2021 vs 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by

cost of sales and gross profit 



the yearoveryear increase in cost of sales during 2021 as compared with 2020 was due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses and incremental yearoveryear material and labor costs this increase was partially offset by lower incremental yearoveryear acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with acquisitions the acquisition of aldevron in 2021 and cytiva in 2020 which increased cost of sales by 59 million in 2021 and 457 million in 2020 

the yearoveryear increase in gross profit margin during 2021 as compared with 2020 was due primarily to higher yearoveryear sales volumes including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses and the impact of the change in mix of sales to higher margin product lines the acquisitionrelated charges of 76 million incurred in 2021 associated with fair value adjustments to deferred revenue related to the cytiva acquisition and fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the acquisitions of both aldevron and cytiva were lower than the 509 million of fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and inventory recorded in 2020 related to the cytiva acquisition which also contributed to the increased gross profit margin in 2021 gross profit margin also benefited in 2021 from the inclusion of a full year of cytiva sales compared to only nine months in 2020 

operating expenses 



sga expenses as a percentage of sales declined 310 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2021 compared with 2020 the decline was driven by the benefit of increased leverage of the company’s general and administrative cost base including amortization expense resulting from higher 2021 sales volumes including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and lower yearoveryear impairment charges related to a facility a trade name and other intangible assets incurred in 2020 net of impairment charges related to a trade name in 2021 the company’s 2021 transaction costs for the acquisition of aldevron were lower than 2020 transaction costs for the acquisition of cytiva which also benefited sga as a percentage of sales during 2021 these decreases were partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives in 2021 

rd expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales declined slightly in 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily due to the sales growth rate exceeding the spending growth related to new product development initiatives 

other operating expenses and other operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased in 2021 compared with 2020 as a result of the contract settlement expense related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation during 2021 refer to note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

nonoperating income expense 

nonoperating income expense consists primarily of net unrealized and realized gainslosses resulting from changes in the fair value of the company’s investments in equity securities and investments in partnerships the nonservice cost components of net periodic benefit costs and gains on the sale of product lines refer to note 9 in the consolidated financial statements 

loss on early extinguishment of borrowings 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 the company redeemed the €800 million aggregate principal amount of 25 senior unsecured notes due 2025 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a makewhole premium as specified in the applicable indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest the company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings related to the payment of the makewhole premiums and deferred costs in connection with the redemption of 96 million 73 million aftertax the company funded the redemption using available cash balances including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2021 issuance of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 28 senior unsecured notes due 2051 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 the company redeemed the €800 million aggregate principal amount of 17 senior unsecured notes due 2022 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a makewhole premium as specified in the applicable indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest the company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings of 26 million 20 million aftertax related to the payment of makewhole premiums in connection with the redemption the company funded the redemption using available cash balances including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2020 issuance of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 26 senior unsecured notes due 2050 

interest costs 

interest expense of 238 million for 2021 was 37 million lower than in 2020 due primarily to lower average debt balances in 2021 compared to 2020 partially offset by the impact of the weaker us dollar in 2021 on the interest expense for the company’s foreign currency denominated debt and us dollar debt that has been effectively converted into foreign currency through crosscurrency swap derivative contracts interest income of 11 million for 2021 was 60 million lower than in 2020 due primarily to lower average cash balances in 2021 as a result of the funding of the cytiva acquisition in 2020 and the aldevron acquisition in 2021 and lower interest rates

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and 

examinations of previously filed tax returns as further discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities changes in tax laws and regulations and legislative policy changes that may result from the oecd’s initiative on base erosion and profit shifting for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states refer to “—liquidity and capital resources—cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and nonus tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews which take into account the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the other factors referenced in the prior paragraph reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

yearoveryear changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate 



the company’s effective tax rate for 2021 and 2020 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 210 due principally to net discrete benefits related primarily to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the mix of earnings between the us and certain jurisdictions with lower overall tax rates net of changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company’s effective tax rate 

the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the us federal state and nonus jurisdictions the nonus countries in which the company has a significant presence include china denmark germany singapore sweden switzerland and the united kingdom excluding these jurisdictions the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual nonus country would not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company’s taxable income 

the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various us and nonus taxing authorities the irs has completed substantially all of the examinations of the company’s federal income tax returns through 2015 and is currently examining certain of the company’s federal income tax returns for 2016 through 2018 in addition the company has subsidiaries in austria belgium canada china denmark france germany india japan korea switzerland the united kingdom and various other countries states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2020 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company settled the irs audits of its federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2015 in the audit the irs proposed significant adjustments to the company’s taxable income of approximately 27 billion related to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the company’s selfinsurance programs for income tax purposes the recognition of certain premium income has been deferred in accordance with us tax laws related to insurance while the settlement of these matters was not material to the company’s financial statements the settlement does not preclude the irs from proposing similar adjustments in future audits and the irs has continued to examine the deferral of premium income related to selfinsurance programs in its examination of the company’s federal income tax returns for 2016 through 2018 the examination is ongoing and to date the irs has not proposed any adjustments related to the company’s selfinsurance programs due to the enactment of the tcja in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the us corporate tax rate for years after 2017 the company remeasured its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 350 to 210 if the irs proposes adjustments related to the company’s selfinsurance premiums with respect to years prior to the adoption of the tcja and the company is unsuccessful in defending its position any taxes owed to the irs may be computed under the previous 350 statutory tax rate and the company may be required to remeasure the related deferred tax liabilities from 210 to 350 which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed would require a charge to future earnings management believes the positions the company has taken in its us tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws 

tax authorities in denmark have issued tax assessments related to interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2015 during the first quarter of 2021 the company received a notice from the danish tax authorities that included a significant reduction in the interest amounts imposed on the original tax assessments taking into account the revised interest amounts the assessments total approximately dkk 21 billion including interest accrued to date approximately 317 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2021 the company’s appeal of the tax assessments with the danish national tax tribunal has been put on hold awaiting the final outcome of other preceding withholding tax cases that have been brought before the danish high court management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are 

in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions the company intends on pursuing this matter through the danish high court should the appeal to the danish national tax tribunal be unsuccessful while the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could take many years as a result of the payments the company has previously made related to these assessments in order to mitigate further interest accruals the company does not expect the resolution of this matter will have a future material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its cash flow and effective tax rate 

the company expects its 2022 effective tax rate to be approximately 200 which is higher than the 2021 rate due primarily to the impact of net discrete tax benefits on the 2021 effective tax rate and the geographic mix of earnings anticipated for 2022 any future legislative changes in the united states andor potential tax reform in other jurisdictions could cause the company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to income taxes 

discontinued operations 

on july 2 2016 the company completed the separation of its former test  measurement segment industrial technologies segment excluding the product identification businesses and retailcommercial petroleum business by distributing to danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fortive corporation “fortive” the entity the company incorporated to hold such businesses in 2021 the company recorded an income tax benefit of 86 million related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain of the company’s tax returns which were jointly filed with fortive entities these reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns this income tax benefit is included in earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings 

on december 18 2019 the company completed its disposition of its remaining ownership of envista and as a result the results of envista are reported as discontinued operations 

refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income decreased by 572 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily driven by the impact of losses from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2021 compared to gains in 2020 partially offset by higher net earnings and an increase in the income from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments and cash flow hedge adjustments in 2021 compared to 2020 the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of approximately 13 billion for 2021 compared to a gain of approximately 29 billion for 2020 the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain of 378 million for 2021 compared to a loss of 147 million for 2020 the company recorded gains from cash flow hedge adjustments related to the company’s derivative contracts in 2021 of 247 million compared to losses of 72 million in 2020 

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk each of which could impact its consolidated financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its financial statements as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2021 an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 17 billion 

as of december 31 2021 the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurobased commercial paper borrowings refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2021 as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature the company may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings to the extent commercial paper markets are available in 2021 the average annual interest rate associated with the company’s outstanding commercial 

paper borrowings was approximately negative 12 basis points a hypothetical increase of this average by 100 basis points would have increased the company’s annual interest expense by approximately 20 million 

refer to “results of operations—interest costs” for discussion of the company’s crosscurrency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements 

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into us dollars danaher’s functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in nonus subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders’ equity 

currency exchange rates positively impacted 2021 reported sales on a yearoveryear basis primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against most major currencies during the first nine months of 2021 slightly offset by the strengthening of the us dollar during the fourth quarter of 2021 if the currency exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2021 were to prevail throughout 2022 currency exchange rates would decrease 2022 estimated sales relative to 2021 sales by approximately 10 strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2021 would adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2021 would positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk although the company has used foreign currencydenominated debt and crosscurrency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in nonus operations against adverse movements in exchange rates both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the company’s consolidated financial statements in addition the company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2021 would have reduced foreign currencydenominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by approximately 16 billion refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s hedging of a portion of its net investment in nonus operations 

equity price risk 

the company’s investment portfolio from time to time includes publiclytraded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price as of december 31 2021 the company held 88 million of publiclytraded equity securities additionally the company holds nonmarketable equity investments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks these nonmarketable equity investments are accounted for under the fair value alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require charges or gains to be recognized in earnings 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and typically with highquality financial institutions so that exposure at any one institution is limited 

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow cash on hand and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses including capital expenditures consummating strategic acquisitions and investments paying interest and servicing debt paying dividends funding restructuring activities and managing its capital structure on a shortterm and longterm basis 

the company has relied primarily on borrowings under its commercial paper program to address liquidity requirements that exceed the capacity provided by its operating cash flows and cash on hand while also accessing the capital markets from time to time including to secure financing for more significant acquisitions subject to any limitations that may result from the covid19 pandemic or other market disruptions such as the disruptions in the financial and capital markets that occurred at times in 2020 the company anticipates following the same approach in the future 

following is an overview of the company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended december 31 

overview of cash flows and liquidity 



• operating cash flows from continuing operations increased approximately 21 billion or 34 during 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net earnings from continuing operations after excluding charges for 

depreciation amortization including intangible assets and inventory stepup stock compensation gain on sale of product lines unrealized investment gainslosses loss on the extinguishment of debt and the contract settlement expense in 2021 these increases were partially offset by higher cash used in aggregate for accounts receivables inventories trade accounts payable and accrued and prepaid expenses in 2021 compared to the prior year 

• net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures and investments net of proceeds from the sale of investments and decreased primarily as a result of lower cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 compared to 2020 refer to notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of the company’s acquisitions and investments 

• as of december 31 2021 the company held approximately 26 billion of cash and cash equivalents 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from periodtoperiod as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 84 billion for 2021 an increase of approximately 21 billion or 34 as compared to 2020 the yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to the following factors 

• 2021 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2021 as compared to 2020 

• net earnings for 2021 reflected an increase of approximately 679 million of depreciation amortization stock compensation expense unrealized investment gainslosses loss on the extinguishment of debt and contract settlement expense as compared to 2020 amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments depreciation expense relates to both the company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operatingtype lease arrangements contract settlement expense represents the pretax charge related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the contract settlement expense depreciation amortization stock compensation and contract settlement expense are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows cash flows from the gain on sale of product lines and loss on the extinguishment of debt are reflected in cash flows from investing activities while unrealized investment gainslosses impact net earnings without immediately impacting cash flows as the cash flow impact from investments occurs when the invested capital is returned to the company 

• the aggregate of trade accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable used 564 million in operating cash flows during 2021 compared to 160 million of operating cash flows used in 2020 the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the company manages the cash conversion cycle which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period 

• the aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used 94 million in operating cash flows during 2021 compared to 739 million provided in 2020 the timing of cash payments for taxes various employeerelated liabilities customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2021 the company held approximately 26 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were on deposit with financial institutions or invested in highly liquid investmentgrade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 02 of the cash and cash equivalents 353 million was held within the united states and approximately 22 billion was held outside of the united states the company will continue to have cash requirements to support general corporate purposes which may include working capital needs capital expenditures acquisitions and investments paying interest and servicing debt paying taxes and any related interest or penalties funding its restructuring activities and pension plans as required paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing shares of the company’s common stock and supporting other business needs 

the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required the company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs if available or borrow under the company’s fiveyear facility enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs if available andor access the capital markets the company also may from time to time seek to access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws most of the company’s foreign cash could be repatriated to the united states following enactment of the tcja and the associated transition tax in general repatriation of cash to the united states can be completed with no incremental us tax however repatriation of cash could subject the company to nonus taxes on distributions the cash that the company’s nonus subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance nonus operations and investments including acquisitions the income taxes if any applicable to such earnings including basis differences in our nonus subsidiaries are not readily determinable as of december 31 2021 management believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states 

during 2021 the company contributed 10 million to its us defined benefit pension plans and 50 million to its nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2022 the company’s cash contribution requirements for its us and its nonus defined benefit pension plans are forecasted to be approximately 10 million and 48 million respectively the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from periodtoperiod for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

acquired intangibles —the company’s business acquisitions including the cytiva and aldevron acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill developed technology and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur the fair values of acquired intangibles are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the company significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” revenue revenue growth rates royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates these assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions the company engages thirdparty valuation specialists who review the company’s critical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions in connection with acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2021 the company recognized aggregate goodwill of approximately 72 billion and intangible assets of approximately 40 billion refer to notes 1 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing its goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a marketbased approach which relies on current trading multiples of forecasted ebitda for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units to calculate an estimated fair value of each reporting unit in evaluating the estimates derived by the marketbased approach management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

as of december 31 2021 the company had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2021 indicated that in all instances the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 175 to approximately 1200 to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value 

over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 145 to approximately 1100 

the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred for finitelived intangibles requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists determining whether an impairment loss occurred for indefinitelived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of intangible assets impairment charges recorded during 2021 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements historically the company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct 

contingent liabilities —as discussed in “item 3 legal proceedings” and notes 8 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency or contract settlement expense that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims the cost of both pending and future claims and the value of the elements in the outcome in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

income taxes —for a description of the company’s income tax accounting policies refer to notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company’s financial statements 

the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when based upon the technical merits it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when 1 a tax audit is completed 2 applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or 3 the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of the company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark and the united states refer to “—results of operations—income taxes” and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its effective tax rate 

an increase of 10 in the company’s 2021 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2021 of 76 million 

valuation of investments in equity securities —for a description of the company’s investments in equity securities and partnerships refer to notes 1 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements the company invests in publiclytraded securities nonmarketable securities of earlystage companies and equity method investments including partnerships that invest primarily in earlystage companies 

investments in earlystage companies have significant risks including uncertainty regarding the investee company’s ability to successfully develop new technologies and services bring these new technologies and services to market and gain market acceptance maintain adequate capitalization and access to cash or other forms of liquidity and retain critical management personnel refer to “item 1a risk factors” for a further discussion of the risks related to investing in earlystage companies 

the company’s investments in publicly traded securities are measured at fair value based on quotes in active markets for investments in nonmarketable equity securities where the company does not have influence over the investee the company has elected the measurement alternative and records these investments at cost and adjusts the carrying value for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from the same issuer adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the securities if applicable valuations of nonmarketable equity securities are complex and require judgment due to the absence of market prices lack of liquidity and the risks inherent in earlystage companies the uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed and those differences could be material 

the company accounts for its investments in the partnerships using the equity method accordingly the investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the partnership’s income or loss and distributions received the partnerships’ investments are recorded by the partnerships on an estimated fair value basis and pose the same risks and require the same valuation judgments discussed above as a result changes in the value of investments in the partnership will have a direct impact on the company’s earnings impairment losses are recognized to reduce the investment’s carrying value to its fair value if there is a decline in fair value below carrying value that is considered to be otherthantemporary to determine whether there is an otherthantemporary impairment the company uses qualitative and quantitative valuation methods 

realized and unrealized gains losses for these investments in equity securities and partnerships are recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of earnings a 10 decrease in the carrying value of the company’s investments in equity securities and partnerships as of december 31 2021 would result in a loss of approximately 160 million

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of the company’s revenue in 2020 was from customers other than governmental entities each of danaher’s segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result the company is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements refer to “item 1a risk factors” no material portion of danaher’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government entity 

regulatory matters 

the company faces extensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of its products and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that the company is subject to these are not the only regulations that the company’s businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that the company’s businesses are subject to refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical device regulations 

many of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders including but not limited to the us food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the united states to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products many medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries in which they are produced or sold 

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval “pma” before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device 

a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time 

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained 

any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state and nonus agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to the current good manufacturing practices “cgmp” requirements as set forth in the quality systems regulation “qsr” which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process 

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting “mdr” requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses 

in the european union “eu” our products are subject to the medical device and in vitro medical device laws of the various member states which for many years were based on directives of the european commission however in may 2017 the eu adopted new formal regulations to replace such directives specifically the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and in vitro devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance the eu regulations were adopted with staggered transitional periods that have since been updated the full application of the eu mdr has been postponed until may 2021 while the eu ivdr will be fully applicable in may 2022 complying with the eu mdr and eu ivdr requires modifications to our quality management systems additional resources in certain functions and updates to technical files among other changes which cost approximately 30 million in 2020 and we anticipate will cost approximately 35 million in 2021 

other healthcare laws 

we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and various health care related laws regulating fraud and abuse research and development pricing and sales and marketing practices and the privacy and security of health information including the us federal regulations described below many states foreign countries and supranational bodies have also adopted laws and regulations similar to and in some cases more stringent than the us federal regulations discussed above and below including the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws 

• many of our healthcarerelated products are purchased by healthcare providers that typically bill various thirdparty payers such as governmental healthcare programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable nonus programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result many of our healthcarerelated products are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by the us department of health and human services “hhs” including the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and services including laws and regulations related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and healthcare fraud thirdparty payers are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services and in international markets many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies price ceilings decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for any product or a decision by a thirdparty payor not to cover a product could reduce usage and patient demand for the product 

• the us federal antikickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting offering receiving or providing remuneration including any kickback or bribe directly or indirectly in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

• the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” prohibits knowingly and willfully 1 executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program including private payors or 2 falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits items or services in addition hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 also restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable health information and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information similar to the us federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under hipaa or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

• the false claims act imposes liability on any person or entity that among other things knowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program knowingly makes uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the us federal government the qui tam provisions of the false claims act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery in addition the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the us federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act 

• the federal civil monetary penalties law prohibits among other things the offering or transferring of remuneration to a medicare or medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of medicare or medicaid payable items or services 

• the open payments act requires manufacturers of medical devices covered under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program with specific exceptions to record payments and other transfers of value to a broad range of healthcare providers and teaching hospitals and to report this data as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members to hhs for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level and an increasing number of countries either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals 

in addition some of the in vitro diagnostic drugsofabuse assays and reagents sold by the company’s subsidiaries contain small amounts of controlled substances and as a result some of the company’s facilities are inspected periodically by the united states drug enforcement administration to ensure that the company properly handles stores and disposes of controlled substances in the manufacture of those products 

federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers analogous us state laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws also may apply to our business practices including but not limited to research distribution sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including private insurers further there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the us federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa

healthcare reform 

in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs improving quality or expanding access for example in the united states in march 2010 the us patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “ppaca” was signed into law which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry since its enactment there have been judicial congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ppaca and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the ppaca in the future 

moreover there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed among other things to bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products individual states in the united states have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing 

data privacy and security laws 

as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states hipaa privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy in particular the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which came into effect in january 2020 has some of the same features as the gdpr discussed below and has already prompted several other states to consider enacting similar laws the eu general data protection regulation that became effective in may 2018 “gdpr” has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect transmit process and retain personal data including among other things in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities with significant fines for noncompliance several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions for a discussion of risks related to these laws refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

environmental laws and regulations 

for a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that the company’s operations products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

antitrust laws 

the us federal government most us states and many other countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of these laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages 

exportimport compliance 

the company is required to comply with various us exportimport control and economic sanctions laws including 

• the international traffic in arms regulations administered by the us department of state directorate of defense trade controls which among other things imposes license requirements on the export from the united states of defense articles and defense services listed on the us munitions list 

• the export administration regulations administered by the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security which among other things impose licensing requirements on the export incountry transfer and reexport of certain dualuse goods technology and software which are items that have both commercial and military or proliferation applications 

• the regulations administered by the us department of treasury office of foreign assets control which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries governments and persons based on united states foreign policy and national security considerations and 

• the import regulatory activities of the us customs and border protection and other us government agencies 

other nations’ governments have implemented similar exportimport control and economic sanction regulations which may affect the company’s operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions 

in addition under us laws and regulations us companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the united states are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the united states or between the united states and countries outside of the united states if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services violate antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability 

for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

the company’s products and services are available worldwide and its principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia the company also has operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows the company to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides greater stability to its operations allows the company to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers the company an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition the company believes that future growth depends in part on its ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target highgrowth markets 

the manner in which the company’s products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of the company’s sales in nonus markets are made by its subsidiaries located outside the united states though the company also sells directly from the united states into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors and in some cases directly in countries with low sales volumes the company generally sells through representatives and distributors

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions economic conditions geopolitical events changes in laws regulations or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns including epidemics natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial statements including our results of operations liquidity financial condition and stock price 

business and strategic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and continues to pose risks to certain elements of our business and our financial statements the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 the global spread of covid19 has led to unprecedented restrictions on and disruptions in business and personal activities including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses our communities and governments are taking to mitigate the spread for example many governments have issued “stayathome” orders which restrict business and personal activities and many employers are requiring employees to work from home in addition to existing travel and activity restrictions jurisdictions may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and other activities the pandemic has caused a global recession of potentially extended duration 

the direct impact of covid19 and the preventive and precautionary measures implemented as a result thereof have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect certain elements of our company including to a different degree our operations commercial organizations supply chains and distribution systems and the future impact may be material though the impact on our different businesses and the different elements of our businesses varies please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of how covid19 impacted our results of operations and financial position in 2020 without limiting the foregoing we have experienced andor may in the future experience 

• adverse impacts on customer orders and purchases and unpredictable reductions in demand for many of our products 

• constraints on the movement of our products through the supply chain 

• adverse impacts on our collections of accounts receivable including delays in collections and increases in uncollectible receivables 

• supply chain capacity constraints and price increases including with respect to freight services 

• adverse impacts on our workforce andor key employees 

• unpredictable increases in demand for certain products and 

• increased cybersecurity attack activity 

in an effort to optimize availability of needed medical and other supplies and products in connection with the covid19 pandemic we may elect to or governments may require us or our customers to allocate manufacturing capacity for example pursuant to the us defense production act “dpa” in a way that adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations results in differential treatment of customers andor adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships for example certain of our customers are or have been subject to dpa requirements relating to the production of covid19 related products and have required certain of our businesses to also comply with these requirements under our supply agreements further the biomedical advanced research and development authority “barda” of the us government has agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity at one of our businesses for covid19 related products and in connection therewith the business has committed certain of such incremental production capacity to the us government pursuant to the dpa in addition unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products can exceed our capacity to meet such demand on a timely basis or at all which can result in negative publicity and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements the accelerated development and production of products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic also increases the risk of regulatory enforcement actions product defects or claims thereof in addition the covid19 vaccines that are developed may not all use danaher’s vaccine developmentproduction solutions andor may use danaher’s solutions to different degrees and if the number of covid19 vaccines under development declines for example because one or a limited number of vaccines emerges as the preferred solution the demand for danaher’s vaccine developmentproduction solutions may decline danaher’s covid19 testing solutions may also not ultimately be the preferred testing solutions for covid19 any of these developments may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

although we successfully issued debt and equity in underwritten offerings in 2020 covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which has increased the cost of and adversely impacted access to capital including in the commercial paper markets and increased economic uncertainty there are no assurances that the commercial paper markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

while the pandemic continues we expect to experience continued adverse impacts on our business and financial statements which adverse impacts are unpredictable and may be material even to the extent covid19 conditions begin to improve the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts andor the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and line of business the actions danaher’s businesses take in response to any improvements in conditions may vary widely by geography and line of business and will likely be made with incomplete information pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature incorrect or insufficient and could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial statements in addition any restructuring activities we undertake in light of the covid19 impact may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

conditions in the global economy the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower economic growth in the domestic andor international markets actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment or underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade fiscal tax and monetary policies changes in capital requirements for financial institutions government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

• reducing demand for our products and services in this annual report references to products and services also includes software limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies 

• increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

• increasing price competition in our served markets 

• supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products 

• increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets 

• increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which in addition to increasing the risks identified above could result in preference actions against us and 

• adversely impacting market sizes and growth rates 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce the prices we charge 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors refer to “item 1 business—competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements for example increased demand for products incorporating digital capabilities or more environmentallyfriendly products and supplier practices as well as changes in the way healthcare services are delivered including the movement of some care from acute to nonacute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector particularly in the healthcare industry are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs and improve efficiency and effectiveness in addition significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems safety alerts and publications about products reflecting the competitive significance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in our industry our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses in addition the company’s competitors and customers have from time to time introduced and may in the future introduce private label generic or lowcost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points competitors’ products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall resulting in an adverse effect on the company’s business and financial statements 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences 

• allocate our rd funding to products and services with higher growth prospects 

• anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization 

• innovate and develop new technologies and applications and acquire or obtain rights to thirdparty technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets 

• obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner price them competitively and costeffectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time 

• obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable as well as achieving thirdparty reimbursement and 

• stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies 

if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in rd of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our business and financial statements even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we often incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice competitors may also develop aftermarket services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce and increase the predictability of costs which can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce and increase the predictability of costs including the following 

• many of our customers and the endusers to whom our customers supply products rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities the ppaca health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or endusers of our products and services andor the volume of medical procedures using our products and services for example the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 or pama introduced a multiyear pricing program for services payable under the clinical laboratory fee schedule “clfs” that is designed to bring medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers it is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services but to the extent our customers conclude that medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products other countries as well as some private payors also control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations tying reimbursement to outcomes or in the case of governmental entities through compulsory licensing global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement 

• governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services centralizing purchasing limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services payors are also seeking to improve price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases 

these changes as well as other impacts from market demand government regulations thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is delivered reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors heighten clinical data requirements reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

international economic political legal compliance social and business factors can negatively affect our business and financial statements 

in 2020 approximately 61 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in the highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

• interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers 

• differences in terms of sale including longer payment terms than are typical in the united states 

• local product preferences and product requirements 

• changes in a country’s or region’s political social or economic conditions such as the devaluation of particular currencies 

• trade protection measures embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements 

• unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements including changes in tax laws 

• capital controls and limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises 

• changes in local healthcare delivery payment and reimbursement policies and programs 

• limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor or employment regulations 

• difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis 

• differing protection of intellectual property and 

• greater uncertainty risk expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions including with respect to product and other regulatory approvals 

international business risks have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our business and financial statements 

for example in 2020 we generated approximately 12 of our sales from china accordingly our business and financial statements can be adversely influenced by political economic legal compliance and social conditions in china generally additionally china’s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies and it maintains control over china’s economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies further considerable uncertainty exists regarding the longterm effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies including the united states and china uncertainty or adverse changes to economic conditions in china or the policies of china’s government or its laws and regulations can have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china and can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

in addition our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics such as covid19 which could adversely impact our supply chains and distribution systems reduce demand for our products and services and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our growth can suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our business and financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes marketing or promotional programs new product introductions the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors any of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial statements in any given period 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development supply and marketing of certain products potential products and technologies and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies relying on collaborative relationships is risky because among other things our collaborative partners may 1 not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations 2 fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner 3 be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent 4 compete with us 5 disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship 6 have insufficient capital resources and 7 decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products 

involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

acquisitions divestitures and investment risks 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers or investors the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions and investments has resulted and may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments 

our acquisition of businesses investments joint ventures and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our business and financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions refer to mda for additional details for example our acquisition of cytiva in march 2020 is danaher’s largest acquisition to date based on purchase price acquisitions including the acquisition of cytiva investments joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including but not limited to the following any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements 

• businesses technologies services and products that we acquire or invest in sometimes underperform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid fail to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or fail to achieve andor sustain profitability 

• we from time to time incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic relationships which can also cause a deterioration of danaher’s credit ratings result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets 

• acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period or over the longterm 

• preclosing and postclosing earnings charges can adversely impact our results in any given period and the impact may be substantially different from periodtoperiod 

• acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address 

• we can experience difficulty in integrating cultures personnel operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers 

• we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition investment joint venture or strategic relationship 

• we have assumed and may assume unknown liabilities known contingent liabilities that become realized known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s or investee’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies can increase our expenses adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations 

• in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures we often enter into postclosing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments earnout obligations and indemnification obligations which can have unpredictable financial results 

• as a result of our acquisitions and investments we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets or if the value of our investments declines we are required to incur impairment charges 

• we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners or the companies we invest in and we may not be able to direct or influence the management and operations of the joint venture other strategic relationship or investee in the manner we believe is most appropriate exposing us to additional risk and 

• investing in or making loans to earlystage companies often entails a high degree of risk and we do not always achieve the strategic technological financial or commercial benefits we anticipate we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan or our investment may be illiquid for a greaterthanexpected period of time 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our business and financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have disposed could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest spinoff splitoff or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment for example in 2015 danaher separated and splitoff to danaher shareholders the majority of its former communications business in a reverse morris trust transaction with netscout systems inc the “communications disposition” in 2016 danaher separated and spunoff to danaher shareholders its former test  measurement segment industrial technologies segment excluding the product identification businesses and retailcommercial petroleum business collectively known as fortive corporation the “fortive disposition” and in 2019 danaher consummated the separation and initial public offering “ipo” and subsequent splitoff of its dental segment known as envista holdings corporation the “envista disposition” transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions can dilute the company’s earnings per share have other adverse financial tax and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes can arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we or our predecessors have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our business or financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the communications disposition the fortive disposition or the envista disposition could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements 

with respect to each of the communications disposition the fortive disposition and the envista disposition we entered into a separation agreement and related agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and the relationship between the respective companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party that can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty if we are required to indemnify any of the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between danaher and such other parties and require danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements 

we could incur significant liability if any of the communications disposition the fortive disposition or the envista disposition is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the communications disposition the fortive disposition and the envista disposition qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code these opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the internal revenue service “irs” could determine on audit that any such transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion if any such transaction is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

operational risks 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are provided andor managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations in addition some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes these systems products and services including those we acquire through business acquisitions can be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate attacks can also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services or security breaches of third party systems we rely on to process store or transmit electronic information can result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers patients or suppliers like most multinational corporations our information technology systems and data have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions the attacks breaches misappropriations and other disruptions and damage described above can interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets result in disclosure of personally identifiable information damage customer patient business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

in addition our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards evolving customer expectations changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectively address these requirements further a greater number of our employees are working remotely in response to the covid19 pandemic and related governmental and community responses which exposes us to greater cybersecurity risks 

any inability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches can result in adverse regulatory consequences business consequences and litigation as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business please see “item 1 business—regulatory matters” for additional information entities that are 

found to be in violation of hipaa as the result of a breach of unsecured patient health information a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the hhs may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative fines and penalties andor additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with hhs to settle allegations of hipaa noncompliance failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions there is also a new broad privacy law in california the ccpa which came into effect in january 2020 the ccpa has some of the same features as the gdpr and has already prompted several other states to consider enacting similar laws government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties any of which may adversely affect our business and financial statements in addition compliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the united states and around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures and may require further changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services or allegations thereof can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to “off label” use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from thirdparties can lead to personal injury death andor property damage and adversely affect our business and financial statements these events can lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants government agencies and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane power shortage or outage public health crisis including epidemics and pandemics and the reaction thereto war terrorism riot or other natural or manmade disasters such as the covid19 pandemic and the damage caused to our facilities by hurricane maria in puerto rico in 2017 if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services diminish demand damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our business and financial statements could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials or components natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the fda and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products an alternative manufacturer is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant adverse impacts to our business and financial statements 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our business and financial statements may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services can cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from thirdparties for use in our manufacturing operations including metallicbased components electronic components chemistries oem products plastics and other petroleumbased products our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers from time to time extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our business and financial statements may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance regulatory requirements cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions such as trade protectionism and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors can result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns can adversely affect our business and financial statements the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels also impacts our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries can adversely impact our business and financial statements 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business—materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business and financial statements in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to when commodity prices rise we are not always able to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs our margins and profitability could decline and our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our restructuring actions can have longterm adverse effects on our business and financial statements 

we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and 

can slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions moreover we may not succeed in implementing present or future restructuring activities or cost reduction activities realizing the anticipated benefits from these initiatives if any benefits are achieved at all can take several years and we may be unable to achieve our targeted cost efficiencies and profit margin improvements additionally we may have insufficient access to capital to fund investments in these strategic initiatives or our business strategy may change from time to time which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

certain of our us and nonus employees are subject to collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

intellectual property risks 

if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or if thirdparties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the united states 

many of the markets we serve are technologydriven and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing in some circumstances enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that thirdparties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights can adversely impact our business and financial statements 

these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information intellectual property technology and other assets comparable to the united states the risks we encounter in such countries include but are not limited to the following 

• joint ventures that we participate in can include restrictions that could compromise our control over the intellectual property technology and proprietary information of the joint venture 

• as we expand our operations globally increasing amounts of our data intellectual property and technology is used and stored in countries outside the united states and regulations in certain countries require data to be stored locally these factors increase the risk that such data intellectual property and technology could be stolen or otherwise compromised 

• certain of our products have been counterfeited and we may encounter additional andor increased levels of counterfeiting in the future 

• governmental entities may adopt regulations or other requirements that give them rights to certain of our intellectual property technology andor proprietary information such as through compulsory licensing or foreign ownership restrictions or requirements 

• in certain countries we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property rights as we do in the united states 

• governmental regulations relating to state secrecy or other topics limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdictions and 

• risks costs and challenges of operating in a particular jurisdiction can result in a decision to relocate or divert operations to a different jurisdiction potentially at higher cost 

any of these risks can adversely impact our business and financial statements refer to “—international economic political legal compliance social and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements” for a discussion of additional risks relating to our international operations 

thirdparties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties’ intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others disputes or litigations regarding intellectual property can be costly and timeconsuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others be required to cease marketing manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign reengineer or rebrand our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business and financial statements thirdparty intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations when we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others we are not always able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms if at all even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

the us government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a thirdparty if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property 

certain technology licensed by us under agreements with thirdparty licensors is subject to government rights government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a governmentfunded program can include a nonexclusive royaltyfree worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us or our licensors as applicable to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a thirdparty if they determine that 1 adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use 2 such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or 3 such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations further the government rights include the right to use and disclose without limitation technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense 

financial and tax risks 

our outstanding debt has increased significantly as a result of the cytiva acquisition and we may incur additional debt in the future our existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 212 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to incur approximately 44 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under our credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances our debt level and related debt service obligations as well as the dividend obligations pursuant to our series a and series b mandatory convertible preferred stock “mcps” can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt or dividends on our mcps which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and other investments 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates 

if our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained 

our credit facilities and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets and a requirement under our credit facilities to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity of 065 to 10 or less if we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our business and financial statements including without limitation our liquidity if we add new debt in the future the risks described above would increase 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2020 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 567 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates can impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments adversely affect our financial statements in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which can from time to time require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar adversely affects the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening of the us dollar generally results in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency can also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments can affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities can result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous nonus jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” was enacted the tcja significantly revised the us federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate to 210 implementing a quasiterritorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on unremitted cumulative nonus earnings of foreign subsidiaries “transition tax” 

due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the tcja the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities can be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected please refer to mda for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of the factors referenced in the preceding sentence may be substantially different from periodtoperiod 

in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities such as the audits described in mda and the company’s consolidated financial statements if audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our results can include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements can be adversely affected for example the danish tax authority’s assessments purporting to impose withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on historical borrowings from certain of the company’s subsidiaries further discussed in mda and the company’s consolidated financial statements could take many years to resolve and could ultimately result in a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its cash flows and effective tax rates any further significant changes to the tax system in the united states or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below could also adversely affect our financial statements please see mda and the company’s consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company’s tax audits 

changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position 

the us congress government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” for which the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan that have been adopted and expanded by many taxing authorities to address perceived tax abuse and inconsistencies between tax jurisdictions as a result the tax laws in the united states and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

legal political and economic uncertainty surrounding the exit of the united kingdom “uk” from the eu could have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

the uk ceased to be a member state of the eu on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” and the transition period provided for in the withdrawal agreement entered by the uk and the eu ended on december 31 2020 in december 2020 the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that applies provisionally until it is ratified by the parties to the agreement on december 31 2020 the uk passed legislation giving effect to the trade and cooperation agreement with the eu expected to formally adopt the agreement in the first half of 2021 the trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the uk and the eu including with respect to trade transport visas judicial matters law enforcement and security matters and provides for continued participation in community programs and mechanisms for dispute resolution uncertainties remain regarding the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement and the other potential impacts of brexit such as the impact of new or different laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate including potentially new or different regulations affecting clearance or approval of products that are developed or manufactured in the uk and trade and tax impacts as the uk negotiates its own tax and trade treaties with countries around the world the impacts from brexit could add time and expense to the conduct of our business delay regulatory approval of products adversely impact the manufacturing or movement of products adversely impact customer demand and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements as of december 31 2020 the company had eight manufacturing facilities in the uk and the company’s net investment in property plant and equipment in the uk was 214 million for the year ended december 31 2020 less than 5 of our sales were derived from customers located in the uk however the impact of brexit could also impact our business and financial statements outside the uk 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees can increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements 

legal regulatory compliance and reputational risks 

significant developments or changes in us laws or policies including changes in us trade policies and tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto particularly china can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

significant developments or changes in us laws and policies including as a result of the new us administration such as laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate or governing the health care system and drug prices can adversely affect our business and financial statements for example the previous us administration increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states and trade tensions between the united states and china escalated with each country imposing significant additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country the us and china could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect our access to markets these factors have adversely affected and in the future could further adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems including our code of conduct always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance economic and trade sanctions money laundering and data privacy in particular the 

us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct and material violations of such code of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business and financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

in addition to the environmental health safety health care medical device anticorruption data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this annual report our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

• we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory in addition we sell and provide products and technology to third parties such as agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to endusers and if any of these third parties do not comply with applicable export or import laws we may incur liability in addition from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures have prevented and will prevent violations of these regulations and any violation can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

• we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities less than 5 of our 2020 sales were made to the us federal government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts our agreements with government entities are in some cases subject to termination reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements reductions in federal spending and other factors and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract in certain cases a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process can become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder which could result in loss of the contract we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts 

these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and can be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations can result in import detentions fines damages civil and administrative penalties injunctions consent decrees suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts disbarment from selling to certain governmental agencies or exclusion from government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of noncompliance disruption of our business limitation on our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services loss of customers significant legal and investigatory fees disgorgement individual imprisonment reputational harm contractual damages diminished profits curtailment or restricting of business operations criminal prosecution and other monetary and nonmonetary penalties compliance with these and other regulations can also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and 

failure to comply with these rules can result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements for additional information regarding these risks refer to “item 1 business—regulatory matters”

to varying degrees these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance such as 510k clearance or approvals for our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained even after initial regulatory clearance or approval we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product such as 

providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use which could reduce the product’s market acceptance we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse research and development pricing and sales and marketing practices the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards including the federal regulations described in “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

government authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations agency guidance or case law failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of laws or regulations failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share remediation and increased compliance costs recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products fines expenses injunctions civil penalties criminal penalties consent decrees administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance suspension or withdrawal of approvals premarket notification rescissions and other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements” further defending against any such actions can be costly and timeconsuming and may require significant personnel resources therefore even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us our business may be impaired ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs 

our products are subject to clinical trials the results of which may be unexpected or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or a regulator’s or the market’s perception of this clinical data can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements 

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties 

the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products in particular any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda or any other federal state or foreign regulator determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we can be subject to exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements” any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements 

certain modifications to our products may require new 510k clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products 

once a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the united states pursuant to a 510k clearance a manufacturer may be required to notify the fda of certain modifications to the device similar requirements apply in other jurisdictions manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510k clearance or premarket submission but the fda may review any manufacturer’s decision the fda may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary we have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable fda regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510k clearances or other premarket submissions were not required we may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510k clearance if the fda disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510k notifications we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance and we may be subject to civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the health and safety of our employees the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites chemical constituents in products and endoflife disposal and takeback programs for products sold we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire have been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws can result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or financial statements 

in addition we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we can also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks refer to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2020 will have a material effect on our business or financial statements 

changes in governmental regulations can reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change in any of these regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof can reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or restrict our existing activities products and services for example a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies changes in the us fda’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process can have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations can adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines can result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from periodtoperiod

overview 

general 

refer to “item 1 business—general” for a discussion of danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering longterm shareholder value danaher is a multinational business with global operations during 2020 approximately 61 of danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a diversified global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of its products software and services help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of the company’s geographic and industry diversity the company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges including rapid technological development particularly with respect to computing automation artificial intelligence mobile connectivity communications and digitization in most of the company’s served markets the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force consolidation of the company’s competitors and increasing regulation the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and the company’s longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in highgrowth geographies and highgrowth market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions and identify and consummate appropriate investments and strategic partnerships develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins expand and improve the effectiveness of the company’s sales force continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment the company is making significant investments organically and through acquisitions and investments to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources particularly in highgrowth markets in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations 

the covid19 pandemic 

the global spread of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 has led to unprecedented restrictions on and disruptions in business and personal activities including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses our communities and governments have taken and are taking to mitigate the spread of the virus and to manage its impact the company continues to actively monitor the pandemic and has taken and intends to continue taking steps to identify and mitigate 

the adverse impacts on and risks to the company’s business including but not limited to its employees customers business partners manufacturing capabilities and capacity and supply and distribution channels posed by the spread of covid19 and the governmental and community responses thereto the company’s businesses have activated their business continuity plans in response to the pandemic including taking steps in an effort to help keep our workforce healthy and safe and are assessing and updating those plans on an ongoing basis as a result of covid19 the company’s businesses have modified certain of their respective business practices including in many cases with respect to employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and the company expects to take such further actions as may be required by government authorities or as determined to be in the best interests of our employees customers and other business partners the company has developed returntowork protocols designed to help ensure the health and safety of its employees customers and business partners for its businesses to apply as and when returntowork is legally permissible and deemed appropriate we are also working with our suppliers to understand the existing and potential future negative impacts to our supply chain and take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts to date we have not experienced any significant supply chain disruptions given that the prevalence of covid19 and the nature of the response thereto including the degree to which restrictions are being relaxed or reimposed varies significantly by geography the impact of the pandemic on the company’s different business locations around the world at any given time also varies significantly 

we are also deploying our capabilities expertise and scale to address the critical health needs related to covid19 we have developed and made available a diagnostic test for the rapid detection of covid19 and a diagnostic test that can detect antibodies in blood to confirm current or past exposure to covid19 in addition our businesses including the recently acquired cytiva business the cytiva acquisition is described below are providing critical support to firms that are developing and producing vaccines for covid19 among other support cytiva net of the product line divestitures required for regulatory approval of the acquisition contributed approximately 1800 basis points to the increase in the company’s total sales in 2020 compared to 2019 we estimate that covid19 related demand contributed between approximately 700 to 750 basis points to the company’s core sales growth including cytiva in 2020 compared to 2019 for the definition of “core sales including cytiva” refer to “—results of operations” below as and to the extent the covid19 pandemic subsides we expect the demand for products and services related to covid19 will also subside as further discussed below while covid19 has positively impacted revenues for certain of our businesses the pandemic and response thereto had a material negative impact on revenues and profitability in other of our businesses in 2020 and while conditions overall improved sequentially from the second quarter through the end of 2020 the global demand for many of our products and services may remain depressed at least in the nearterm if not longer 

as noted below and subject to the assumptions discussed below the company expects core sales and core sales including cytiva to grow in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year however due to the speed with which the covid19 situation continues to evolve the global breadth of its spread the range of governmental and community responses thereto and our geographic and business line diversity its further impact on our business remains highly uncertain but may be materially negative and will depend on future developments including but not limited to 

• the duration of weaknesses in the macroeconomic environment and the timing and extent of recovery in the global demand for our products and services 

• the pace at which medical providers resume patient care and testing that is not related to the covid19 pandemic the timing of when research performed by laboratories and other institutions return to normal levels and payment and funding dynamics related to the foregoing and 

• the development and rate of adoption of the products we are offering to help address the pandemic and the effects thereof competitive product launches and related pricing pressure impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings and the degree to which covid19 testing solutions and vaccines are made available and utilized 

for additional information on the risks of covid19 to the company’s operations refer to the “item 1a—risk factors” section of this annual report 

business performance 

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 245 as compared to 2019 acquisitions primarily cytiva contributed 180 to the increase in sales in 2020 while differences exist among the company’s businesses on an overall basis demand for the company’s products and services increased on a yearoveryear basis in 2020 as compared to 2019 this demand together with the company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other businessspecific factors discussed below contributed to yearoveryear core sales growth of 65 and core sales growth including cytiva of 95 for the definition of “core sales” refer to “—results of operations” below from the date of danaher’s acquisition of cytiva on march 31 2020 through december 31 2020 cytiva’s core sales grew more than 30 compared to the comparable 2019 period when the cytiva business was owned by general electric company “ge” reflecting strength in 

its served markets and its support in helping its customers develop and produce vaccines for covid19 geographically both highgrowth and developed markets contributed to yearoveryear core sales growth during 2020 core sales in developed markets grew at a lowdouble digit rate in 2020 as compared to 2019 and were driven by north america and western europe core sales in highgrowth markets grew at a midsingle digit rate in 2020 as compared to 2019 as growth in china and other highgrowth markets in the second half of 2020 more than offset declines in china during the first quarter due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic highgrowth markets represented approximately 30 of the company’s total sales in 2020 

the company’s net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2020 totaled approximately 36 billion compared to approximately 24 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2020 totaled approximately 35 billion or 489 per diluted common share compared to approximately 29 billion or 405 per diluted common share for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in net earnings in 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by net earnings from increased sales in the company’s existing businesses net earnings from cytiva the 2020 gain on sale of product lines and the provision for uncertain tax positions recorded in the first quarter of 2019 discussed below in “—results of operations—income taxes” partially offset by the 2019 gain on the disposition of envista holdings corporation refer to “—results of operations” for further discussion of the yearoveryear changes in net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2020 

while the ultimate impact of covid19 on future periods is highly uncertain the company expects core sales and core sales including cytiva to grow in the first quarter of 2021 assuming the negative impact of the pandemic does not increase in the united states and internationally demand for instruments and consumables related to covid19related testing capabilities as well as supporting customers in pursuit of new covid19related treatments and vaccines are expected to continue to drive growth in 2021 while the performance of the company’s other businesses is expected to continue to improve as discussed above an increase of the covid19 infection rate and the reimposition of government required restrictions could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial statements 

acquisitions and dispositions 

on march 31 2020 the company acquired the biopharma business of ge’s life sciences division now known as cytiva for a cash purchase price of approximately 207 billion net of approximately 01 billion of acquired cash and the assumption of approximately 04 billion of pension liabilities the “cytiva acquisition” cytiva is a leading provider of instruments consumables and software that support the research discovery process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs cytiva is included in the company’s life sciences segment results beginning in the second quarter of 2020 the acquisition has provided and is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company’s life sciences segment by expanding the business’ geographic and product line diversity including new product and service offerings that complement the company’s current biologics workflow solutions 

refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the company’s acquisitions 

envista disposition 

on september 20 2019 envista holdings corporation “envista” a danaher subsidiary at the time completed an underwritten ipo of 308 million shares of its common stock the “ipo” which represented 194 of envista’s outstanding shares at the time of the offering at a public offering price of 2200 per share in connection with the completion of the ipo through a series of equity and other transactions the company transferred its dental businesses to envista the “separation” on december 18 2019 danaher completed the disposition of its remaining 806 ownership of envista common stock through a splitoff exchange offer which resulted in danaher’s repurchase of 229 million shares of danaher common stock in exchange for the remaining shares of envista common stock held by danaher the “splitoff” the ipo separation and splitoff are collectively referred to as the “envista disposition” as a result the company recognized a gain on the disposition of 451 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 equal to the difference between the fair value of the danaher common stock tendered in the exchange offer and the carrying value of envista common stock the accounting requirements for reporting envista as a discontinued operation were met when the splitoff was completed

results of operations 

in this report references to the nongaap measures of core sales also referred to as core revenues or salesrevenues from existing businesses and core sales including cytiva refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 

• sales from acquired businesses as defined below as applicable and 

• the impact of currency translation 

references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit as applicable attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture provided that in calculating core sales including cytiva cytiva’s sales net of the sales of the company product lines divested in 2020 to obtain regulatory approval to acquire cytiva or the “divested product lines” “cytiva sales” are excluded from the definition of sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between 

• the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses as defined above as applicable and 

• the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses as defined above as applicable after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period 

as noted above beginning with results for the second quarter of 2020 the company also presents core sales on a basis that includes cytiva sales prior to the acquisition of cytiva danaher calculated core sales solely on a basis that excluded sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition however given cytiva’s significant size and historical core sales growth rate in each case compared to danaher’s existing businesses management believes it is appropriate to also present core sales on a basis that includes cytiva sales management believes this presentation provides useful information to investors by demonstrating the impact cytiva has on the company’s current growth profile rather than waiting to demonstrate such impact 12 months after the acquisition when cytiva would normally have been included in danaher’s core sales calculation danaher calculates periodtoperiod core sales growth including cytiva by adding to the baseline period sales cytiva’s historical sales from such period when it was owned by ge net of the sales of the divested product lines and also adding the cytiva sales to the current period 

core sales growth and the related measure of core sales including cytiva should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting these nongaap financial measures provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to danaher’s peers management also uses these nongaap financial measures to measure the company’s operating and financial performance and uses core sales growth as one of the performance measures in the company’s executive shortterm cash incentive program the company excludes the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and excludes the effect of acquisitions other than cytiva sales in the case of core sales growth including cytiva and divestiturerelated items because the nature size timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from periodtoperiod and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult 

throughout this discussion references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of dbs 

core sales growth and core sales growth including cytiva 



2020 compared to 2019 

total sales increased 245 on a yearoveryear basis in 2020 primarily as a result of an increase in sales from acquired businesses net of divestitures primarily due to the acquisition of cytiva as well as an increase in core sales resulting from the factors discussed below by segment the impact of currency translation did not have a significant impact on reported sales on a yearoveryear basis in 2020 as the negative impact of a stronger us dollar in the first half of 2020 was offset by the favorable impact of the weakening of the us dollar in the second half of 2020 

operating profit performance 

operating profit margins were 190 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 183 in 2019 the following factors impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons

• higher 2020 core sales volumes lower overall spending levels for business travel and other business activities as a result of the pandemic and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2020 and 2019 net of incremental yearoveryear costs associated with various new product development and sales service and marketing growth investments  170 basis points 

• the incremental accretive effect in 2020 of acquired businesses including cytiva net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations  125 basis points 

2020 vs 2019 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by 

• acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue and incremental transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs in each case related to the acquisition of cytiva  215 basis points the company deems acquisitionrelated transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant generally relating to the company’s larger acquisitions if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisitionrelated transaction costs typical for danaher in a given period 

• impairment charges related to trade names in the environmental  applied solutions segment incurred in the third quarter of 2020  5 basis points

2020 compared to 2019 

price increases in the segment contributed 15 to sales growth on a yearoveryear basis during 2020 as compared with 2019 and are reflected as a component of the change in core revenue growth 

during 2020 total sales in the segment decreased 20 primarily as a result of the factors discussed below related to core sales declines as well as from the negative impact of currency exchange rates core sales in the segment’s water quality businesses increased slightly during 2020 as compared with 2019 as increased demand for consumables was mostly offset by lower overyear demand for equipment as a result of the covid19 pandemic while demand for equipment decreased on a yearoveryear basis in 2020 the company saw sequential improvement in the demand for equipment from the second quarter of 2020 through the end of the year yearoveryear core sales in the analytical instrumentation product line increased in 2020 as increases in western europe and china more than offset decreases in north america and the middle east in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line increased demand in the food and beverage commercial and industrial and power endmarkets was offset by lower demand in the oil and gas primary metals transportation and chemical endmarkets geographically yearoveryear core sales in the chemical treatment solutions product line increased in north america and decreased in latin america core sales in the business’ ultraviolet water disinfection product line increased in 2020 as increased demand in north america and western europe more than offset weaker demand in the highgrowth markets

• the incremental net dilutive effect in 2020 of acquired businesses  15 basis points 

cost of sales and gross profit 



the yearoveryear increase in cost of sales during 2020 as compared with 2019 was due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses and 2020 acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the cytiva acquisition which increased cost of sales by 457 million in 2020 

the yearoveryear increase in gross profit margin during 2020 as compared with 2019 was due primarily to higher yearoveryear sales volumes including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses and higher gross profit margins of recently acquired businesses partially offset by the impact of 2020 acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue in connection with the cytiva acquisition which adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by approximately 215 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019 

operating expenses 



sga expenses as a percentage of sales declined 30 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2020 compared with 2019 the decline was driven by the benefit of increased leverage of the company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2020 sales volumes including sales volumes from recently acquired companies incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2020 and 2019 lower travel expenses in 2020 and lower yearoveryear transaction costs related to the cytiva acquisition these decreases were partially offset by incremental yearoveryear amortization charges which adversely impacted sga as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points primarily related to the cytiva acquisition in 2020 as well as impairment charges related to a facility in the diagnostics segment and trade name and other intangible assets in the environmental  applied solutions segment incurred in the first and third quarters of 2020 and continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives 

rd expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales declined in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to lower rd expenses as a percentage of sales in businesses recently acquired as well as the impact of sales growth rates in 2020 exceeding the spending growth related to the companys new product development initiatives 

nonoperating income expense 

the company disaggregates the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans and presents the other components of net periodic benefit cost in other expense income net these other components include the assumed rate of return on plan assets partially offset by amortization of actuarial losses and interest and aggregated to a gain of 16 million 12 million and 35 million as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the company’s net periodic pension cost for the year ended december 31 2019 includes a settlement loss of 7 million 6 million after tax or 001 per diluted common share as a result of the transfer of a portion of its nonus pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third party

gain on sale of product lines 

as a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the cytiva acquisition the company was required to divest certain of its existing product lines in the life sciences segment that in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately 170 million in 2019 on april 30 2020 the company completed the sale of these product lines for a cash purchase price net of cash transferred and transaction costs of 826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of 455 million 305 million aftertax or 042 per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2020 the divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the company’s operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation 

loss on early extinguishment of borrowings 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 the company redeemed the €800 million aggregate principal amount of 17 senior unsecured notes due 2022 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a makewhole premium as specified in the applicable indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest the company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings of 26 million 20 million aftertax or 003 per diluted common share related to the payment of makewhole premiums in connection with the redemption the company funded the redemption using available cash balances including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2020 issuance of the 26 senior unsecured notes due 2050

interest costs 

interest expense of 275 million for 2020 was 167 million higher than in 2019 due primarily to the impact of higher average debt balances as a result of the issuances of debt in 2019 and 2020 primarily to fund the cytiva acquisition and 2020 borrowings under the company’s 50 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on august 27 2024 subject to a oneyear extension option at the request of the company with the consent of the lenders the “fiveyear facility” and the company’s 50 billion 364day unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that was scheduled to expire on august 26 2020 the “superseded 364day facility” prior to the subsequent repayment of such credit facility borrowings proceeds from these borrowings as well as available cash balances were used to fund the acquisition of cytiva and for general corporate purposes interest income of 71 million for 2020 was 68 million lower than in 2019 due primarily to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances in 2020 due to the funding of the cytiva acquisition 

in january 2019 the company entered into approximately 19 billion of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts on its us dollardenominated bonds to effectively convert the company’s us dollardenominated bonds to obligations denominated in danish kroner japanese yen euro and swiss franc and reduce the interest rate from the stated interest rates on the us dollardenominated debt to the interest rates of the swaps in addition in 2020 the company entered into approximately 10 billion of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts on its us dollardenominated bonds to effectively convert the company’s us 

dollardenominated bonds to obligations denominated in euro and reduce the interest rate from the stated interest rates on the us dollardenominated debt to the interest rates of the swaps as of december 31 2020 approximately 20 billion of the crosscurrency swap derivative contracts remained outstanding for a further description of the company’s debt and crosscurrency swap derivative contracts related to the debt as of december 31 2020 refer to notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as further discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations such as the tcja and legislative policy changes that may result from the oecd’s initiative on base erosion and profit shifting or the change in the us administration for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states refer to “—liquidity and capital resources—cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews which take into account the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the other factors referenced in the prior paragraph reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

yearoveryear changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate 



the company’s effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 210 due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates different than the us federal statutory rate refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company’s effective tax rate 

the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions the nonus countries in which the company has a significant presence include china denmark germany singapore sweden switzerland and the united kingdom excluding these jurisdictions the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company’s taxable income 

the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the irs has completed substantially all of the examinations of the company’s federal income tax returns through 2015 and is currently examining certain of the company’s federal income tax returns for 2016 through 2018 in addition the company has subsidiaries in austria belgium canada china denmark france germany india japan korea switzerland the united kingdom and various other countries states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2018 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 the irs proposed significant adjustments to the company’s taxable income for the years 2012 through 2015 with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the company’s selfinsurance programs for income tax purposes the recognition of premium income has been deferred in accordance with us tax laws related to insurance the irs challenged the deferral of premiums for certain types of the company’s selfinsurance policies these proposed adjustments would have increased the company’s taxable income over the 2012 through 2015 period by approximately 27 billion in the third quarter of 2020 the company settled the 2012 through 2015 audit period with the irs including the resolution of these proposed adjustments the settlement was not material to the company’s financial statements including its cash flows and effective tax rate as the settlement with the irs was specific to the audit period the settlement does not preclude the irs from proposing similar adjustments to the company’s selfinsurance programs 

in current or future audits in connection with its examination of the company’s federal income tax returns for 2016 2017 and 2018 the irs has requested additional information on the company’s selfinsurance programs due to the enactment of the tcja in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the us corporate tax rate for years after 2017 the company revalued its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 350 to 210 if the irs proposes adjustments related to the company’s selfinsurance premiums with respect to years subsequent to 2015 and prior to adoption of the tcja and the company is unsuccessful in defending its position any taxes owed to the irs may be computed under the previous 350 statutory tax rate and the company may be required to revalue the related deferred tax liabilities from 210 to 350 which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed would require a charge to future earnings management believes the positions the company has taken in its us tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws 

tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries on december 10 2013 the company received assessments from the danish tax authority “skat” of approximately dkk 19 billion including interest through december 31 2020 approximately 309 million based on exchange rates as of december 31 2020 imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2009 the company appealed these assessments to the danish national tax tribunal in 2014 the appeal is pending awaiting the final outcome of other preceding withholding tax cases that were appealed to the danish courts and subsequently to the court of justice of the european union “cjeu” in february 2019 the cjeu decided several of these cases and ruled that the exemption of interest payments from withholding taxes provided in the applicable eu directive should be denied where taxpayers use the directive for abusive or fraudulent purposes and that it is up to the national courts to make this determination this decision of the cjeu now awaits application by the danish high court in the other preceding withholding tax cases skat has maintained a similar position related to withholding tax on interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company’s subsidiaries with respect to tax years 2010 through 2015 in 2019 the company received aggregate assessments for these matters of approximately dkk 18 billion including interest through december 31 2020 approximately 302 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2020 the company is appealing these assessments as well 

management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions the company intends on pursuing this matter through the danish high court should the appeal to the danish national tax tribunal be unsuccessful the company will continue to monitor decisions of both the danish courts and the cjeu and evaluate the impact of these court rulings on the company’s tax positions in denmark the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain could take many years and could result in a further material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its cash flow and effective tax rate 

on june 24 2020 skat issued a press release to announce that it has misapplied denmark’s interest rules in some assessments concerning withholding tax and overcharged interest subsequent to year end the company received a notice from skat dated january 15 2021 that includes a significant reduction in the interest amounts due related to the assessments discussed above the company is reviewing the notice and the revised interest calculations received from skat 

the company expects its 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 205 which is higher than the 2020 rate due primarily to the geographic mix of earnings anticipated for 2021 any future legislative changes in the united states andor potential tax reform in other jurisdictions could cause the company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to income taxes 

discontinued operations 

as further discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements discontinued operations include the results of envista which was disposed of during the fourth quarter of 2019 in 2019 earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes were 576 million and reflect the operating results of envista prior to the envista disposition and a gain on the disposition of envista of 451 million net of certain costs associated with the envista disposition including costs related to establishing envista as a standalone entity and legal accounting and investment banking fees 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income increased by approximately 36 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in 2020 compared to a loss in 2019 higher net earnings and a decrease in the loss from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019 partially offset by an increase in losses from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019 the company recorded a foreign currency translation gain of approximately 29 billion for 2020 compared to a translation loss of 75 million for 2019 the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of 147 million for 2020 compared to a loss of 90 million for 2019 the 

company recorded losses from cash flow hedge adjustments related to the company’s crosscurrency swap derivative contracts in 2020 of 72 million compared to losses of 113 million in 2019 

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk each of which could impact its consolidated financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its financial statements as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2020 an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt was primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock by approximately 20 billion 

as of december 31 2020 the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of eurobased commercial paper borrowings refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2020 as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature the company may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings to the extent commercial paper markets are available in 2020 the average annual interest rate associated with the company’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately negative 6 basis points a hypothetical increase of this average to positive 13 basis points would have increased the company’s annual interest expense by 5 million the hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the company’s commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2020 

refer to “results of operations—interest costs” for discussion of the company’s crosscurrency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements 

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into us dollars danaher’s functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders’ equity 

currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on 2020 reported sales on a yearoveryear basis if the currency exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2020 were to prevail throughout 2021 currency exchange rates would increase 2021 estimated sales relative to 2020 sales by approximately 30 strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2020 would adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2020 would positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk although the company has used foreign currencydenominated debt and crosscurrency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the company’s consolidated financial statements in addition the company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 

2020 would have reduced foreign currencydenominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by approximately 15 billion as of december 31 2020 the company had 20 billion of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts outstanding as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations these contracts effectively convert the company’s us dollardenominated bonds to obligations denominated in danish kroner japanese yen euro and swiss franc and partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on foreign currencydenominated net assets during the term of the swap the company also uses crosscurrency swap derivative contracts to hedge us dollardenominated longterm debt issuances in a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro against adverse movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro for a further description of the company’s crosscurrency swap derivative contracts as of december 31 2020 refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

the company’s investment portfolio from time to time includes publiclytraded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price though as of december 31 2020 the company held no availableforsale marketable equity securities the company holds nonmarketable equity investments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks these nonmarketable equity investments are accounted for under the fair value alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require charges or gains to be recognized in earnings 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and typically with highquality financial institutions so that exposure at any one institution is limited 

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses consummating strategic acquisitions and investments paying interest and servicing debt funding restructuring activities and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

notwithstanding the foregoing the company continues to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company’s liquidity and capital resources and has taken actions intended to mitigate adverse impacts historically the company has generally relied on borrowings under its commercial paper program to address liquidity requirements that exceed the capacity provided by its operating cash flows and cash on hand while also accessing the capital markets from time to time to secure financing for more significant acquisitions the covid19 pandemic adversely affected the availability of new borrowings in the commercial paper markets at times during 2020 therefore in the first half of 2020 the company engaged in the following financing transactions 

• the company borrowed 25 billion under the fiveyear facility and 25 billion under the superseded 364day facility for general corporate purposes including payment of a portion of the purchase price for the cytiva acquisition and repayment of certain commercial paper obligations as they matured the company replaced the superseded 364day facility with a new 25 billion 364day facility which was terminated on december 31 2020 all amounts borrowed under the credit facilities referenced above were repaid in 2020 as of december 31 2020 

after taking into account amounts backstopping outstanding commercial paper the company had availability under the fiveyear credit facility of approximately 44 billion for direct borrowings or to backstop the issuance of additional commercial paper to the extent available 

• the company issued approximately €25 billion approximately 27 billion based on currency exchange rates as of the respective dates of the pricing of the notes aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated senior unsecured notes the proceeds of which have been and are being used for general corporate purposes including repayment of the borrowings under the superseded 364day facility and the fiveyear facility and repayment of certain commercial paper obligations as they mature 

• the company completed the 2020 common stock offering and 2020 mcps offering and received net proceeds of approximately 173 billion and 167 billion respectively which have been and will be used for general corporate purposes 

• in october 2020 the company issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of us dollardenominated senior unsecured notes the proceeds of which have been and will be used for general corporate purposes including the redemption of the 2022 euronotes in the fourth quarter of 2020 

following is an overview of the company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended december 31 

overview of cash flows and liquidity 



• operating cash flows from continuing operations increased approximately 26 billion or approximately 70 during 2020 as compared to 2019 due to higher net earnings and excluding noncash impairment charges and fair value adjustments related to certain longlived assets in 2020 noncash charges for depreciation amortization and stock compensation in both periods and noncash discrete tax charges in 2019 higher cash provided by trade accounts payable prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities during the 2020 period 

compared to the prior year partially offset by higher cash used for trade accounts receivable and inventories in 2020 compared to the prior year 

• net cash used in investing activities increased approximately 200 billion during 2020 as compared to 2019 and consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions primarily the cytiva acquisition and to a lesser extent investments refer to notes 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of the company’s acquisitions and investments 

• refer to the discussion at the beginning of the “liquidity and capital resources” section for a summary of the company’s 2020 financing activities 

• as of december 31 2020 the company held approximately 60 billion of cash and cash equivalents 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from periodtoperiod as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 62 billion for 2020 an increase of approximately 26 billion or approximately 70 as compared to 2019 the yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from 2019 to 2020 was primarily attributable to the following factors 

• 2020 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2020 as compared to 2019 partially offsetting the impact of this increase is the fact that 2019 net earnings from continuing operations included 215 million of net discrete noncash tax charges compared to a net discrete noncash tax benefit of 85 million in 2020 in addition net earnings from continuing operations in 2020 included 22 million of noncash impairment charges and 6 million of fair value adjustment gains related to certain longlived assets and investments these noncash charges and gains impacted earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows 

• net earnings for 2020 reflected an increase of approximately 11 billion of depreciation amortization intangible assets and inventory stepup and stock compensation expense as compared to 2019 amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments depreciation expense relates to both the company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operatingtype lease arrangements the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to the cytiva acquisition in 2020 depreciation amortization and stock compensation are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows 

• the aggregate of trade accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable used 160 million in operating cash flows during 2020 compared to 161 million of operating cash flows used in 2019 the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the company manages the cash conversion cycle which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period 

• the aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided 765 million in operating cash flows during 2020 compared to 38 million provided in 2019 the timing of cash payments for taxes various employeerelated liabilities customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change 

investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures including instruments leased to customers cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets 

net cash used in investing activities was approximately 212 billion during 2020 compared to approximately 12 billion of net cash used in 2019

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper issuance and repayment of longterm debt issuance and repurchases of common stock issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders financing activities provided cash of approximately 10 billion during 2020 compared to approximately 164 billion of cash provided during 2019 the yearoveryear decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to the significant borrowings incurred in 2019 to finance the cytiva acquisition partially offset by borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire cytiva and for general corporate purposes 

total debt was approxim ately 212 billion and 217 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and notes payable and current portion of longterm debt was 11 million and 212 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively as of december 31 2020 the company had the ability to incur approximately 44 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the company’s 50 billion fiveyear facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2020 the company has classified 611 million of its borrowings outstanding under the eurodenominated commercial paper program and 290 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 yen notes as longterm debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the company has the intent and ability as supported by availability under the fiveyear facility to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date as commercial paper obligations mature the company may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings to the extent commercial paper markets are available 

under the company’s us and eurodenominated commercial paper program the notes are typically issued at a discount from par generally based on the ratings assigned to the company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to libor or euribor additionally the company’s floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the threemonth euribor plus 03 in july 2017 the head of the united kingdom financial conduct authority announced the intent to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing us dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate or sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities the company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from libor and does not expect the transition to be material to the company’s financial position

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2020 the company held approximately 60 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were on deposit with financial institutions or invested in highly liquid investmentgrade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 02 of this amount approximately 15 billion was held within the united states and approximately 45 billion was held outside of the united states the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures acquisitions and investments pay interest and service debt pay taxes and any related interest or penalties fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required pay dividends to shareholders repurchase shares of the company’s common stock as applicable and support other business needs the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions the company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or fiveyear facility enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program andor issue debt andor equity in the capital markets in each case to the extent such sources of capital remain available the company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws most of the company’s foreign cash could be repatriated to the united states following enactment of the tcja and the associated transition tax in general repatriation of cash to the united states can be completed with no incremental us tax however repatriation of cash could subject the company to nonus jurisdictional taxes on distributions the cash that the company’s nonus subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations investments and acquisitions the income taxes applicable to repatriating such earnings are not readily determinable as of december 31 2020 principally all of the company’s nonus earnings are indefinitely reinvested and management believes that the company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states 

during 2020 the company contributed 140 million to its us defined benefit pension plans and 51 million to its nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2021 the company’s cash contribution requirements for its us and its nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 10 million and 44 million respectively the ultimate 

amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from periodtoperiod for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

acquired intangibles —the company’s business acquisitions including the cytiva acquisition typically result in the recognition of goodwill developed technology and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur the fair values of acquired intangibles are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the company significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” growth rates royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates these assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions the company engages thirdparty valuation specialists who review the company’s critical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions in connection with acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recognized aggregate goodwill of approximately 104 billion and intangible assets of approximately 107 billion refer to notes 1 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing its goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a marketbased approach which relies on current trading multiples of forecasted ebitda for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units to calculate an estimated fair value of each reporting unit in evaluating the estimates derived by the marketbased approach management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

as of december 31 2020 the company had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2020 indicated that in all instances the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 80 to approximately 695 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment 

test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 60 to approximately 615 

the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred for finitelived intangibles requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists determining whether an impairment loss occurred for indefinitelived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of intangible assets impairment charges recorded during 2020 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements historically the company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct 

contingent liabilities —as discussed in “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

revenue recognition —the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in determining if control has transferred the company considers whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present such as the transfer of title present right to payment significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality to determine the consideration that the customer owes the company the company must make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates as well as an estimate for product returns the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or salestype leases refer to notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies 

if the company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect historically the company’s estimates of revenue have been materially correct 

pension and other postretirement benefits —for a description of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices refer to notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors the company’s financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 144 million 110 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 191 million 147 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2020 a 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the us net obligation by 133 million 101 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 175 million 135 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2020 

for 2020 the estimated longterm rate of return for the us plans was 70 and the company intends to use an assumption of 675 for 2021 the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a planbyplan basis based on 

the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 05 to 50 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2020 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2020 would have increased 9 million 7 million on an aftertax basis and 6 million 4 million on an aftertax basis respectively 

for a discussion of the company’s 2020 and anticipated 2021 defined benefit pension plan contributions refer to “—liquidity and capital resources—cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes —for a description of the company’s income tax accounting policies refer to notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company’s financial statements 

the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when based upon the technical merits it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when 1 a tax audit is completed 2 applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or 3 the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of the company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark and the united states refer to “—results of operations—income taxes” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its effective tax rate 

an increase of 10 in the company’s 2020 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2020 of 45 million

the following discussion includes information common to all of danaher’s segments 

materials 

the company’s manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including metallicbased components electronic components chemicals plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas also affect the company’s costs for freight and utilities the company purchases raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components the company utilizes a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to its supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2019  the company had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on the business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for the company’s operations refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

the company owns numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate the company’s intellectual property is important to its operations the company does not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license or any related group of any such items to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time the company engages in litigation to protect its intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to the company’s intellectual property refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher 

competition 

although the company’s businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets the company’s competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of its competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as the company or any of its segments does because of the range of the products and services the company sells and the variety of markets it serves the company encounters a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than it is in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities the company is facing increased competition in a number of its served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line management believes that the company has a market leadership position in many of the markets it serves key competitive factors vary among the company’s businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality performance delivery speed application expertise service and support technology and innovation distribution network breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

working capital 

the company maintains an adequate level of working capital to support its business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in any of our operating segments in addition the company’s sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of its competitors 

backlog 

the company defines backlog as firm orders from customers for products and services where the order will be fulfilled in the next 12 months backlog as of december 31 2019 and 2018 was approximately 31 billion and 28 billion  respectively the company expects that a large majority of the backlog as of december 31 2019 will be delivered to customers within three to four months of such date given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of the company’s products and the shortening of product life cycles the company believes that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2019  the company employed approximately 60000 persons of whom approximately 21000 were employed in the united states and approximately 39000 were employed outside of the united states of the united states employees approximately 300 were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states the company has governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of the company’s employees are represented by unions andor works councils for a discussion of risks related to employee relations refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

research and development “rd” 

the company conducts rd activities for the purpose of developing new products enhancing the functionality effectiveness ease of use and reliability of its existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of its products are appropriate the company’s rd efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology and we work with a number of leading research institutions universities and clinicians around the world to develop evaluate and clinically test our products the company conducts rd activities primarily in north america europe and asia and generally on a businessbybusiness basis although it does conduct certain rd activities on a centralized basis the company anticipates that it will continue to make significant expenditures for rd as it seeks to provide a continuing flow of innovative products and services 

to maintain and improve its competitive position for a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of the company’s revenue in 2019 was from customers other than governmental entities each of danaher’s segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result the company is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements refer to “item 1a risk factors” no material portion of danaher’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government entity 

regulatory matters 

the company faces extensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of its products and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that the company is subject to these are not the only regulations that the company’s businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that the company’s businesses are subject to refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical device regulations 

many of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders including but not limited to the us food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the united states to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products many medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries in which they are produced or sold 

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval “pma” before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time 

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained 

any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state and nonus agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to the current good manufacturing practices “cgmp” requirements as set forth in the quality systems regulation “qsr” which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process 

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting or mdr requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a 

death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses 

in the european union “eu” our products are subject to the medical device laws of the various member states which are currently based on a directive of the european commission however the eu has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until may 2020 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr and until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr complying with the eu mdr and eu ivdr requires modifications to our quality management systems additional resources in certain functions and updates to technical files among other changes which cost less than 15 million in 2019 and we anticipate will cost approximately 30 million in 2020 

other healthcare laws 

we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and various health care related laws regulating fraud and abuse research and development pricing and sales and marketing practices and the privacy and security of health information including the us federal regulations described below many states foreign countries and supranational bodies have also adopted laws and regulations similar to and in some cases more stringent than the us federal regulations discussed above and below including the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws 



the state level and an increasing number of countries either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals 

in addition some of the in vitro diagnostic drugsofabuse assays and reagents sold by the company’s subsidiaries contain small amounts of controlled substances and as a result some of the company’s facilities are inspected periodically by the united states drug enforcement administration to ensure that the company properly handles stores and disposes of controlled substances in the manufacture of those products 

federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers analogous us state laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws also may apply to our business practices including but not limited to research distribution sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including private insurers further there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the us federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa 

for a discussion of risks related to regulation by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and the other regulatory regimes referenced above please refer to section entitled “item 1a risk factors” 

healthcare reform 

in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs improving quality or expanding access for example in the united states in march 2010 the us patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “ppaca” was signed into law which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry since its enactment there have been judicial congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ppaca and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the ppaca in the future 

moreover there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed among other things to bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products individual states in the united states have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing 

coverage and reimbursement 

for products where thirdparty coverage and reimbursement is available sales will depend in part on the extent to which such product will be covered by thirdparty payors such as federal state and foreign government healthcare programs commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations and the level of reimbursement for such product by thirdparty payors decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a planbyplan basis these thirdparty payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services and in international markets many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies price ceilings decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for any product or a decision by a thirdparty payor not to cover a product could reduce usage and patient demand for the product 

data privacy and security laws 

as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states hipaa privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy in particular there is a new broad privacy law in california the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which came into effect in january 2020 the ccpa has some of the same features as the gdpr discussed below and has already prompted several other states to follow with similar laws the eu general data protection regulation that became effective in may 2018 “gdpr” has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect transmit process and retain personal data including among other things in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities and prompt notice to data subjects with significant fines for noncompliance several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions 

environmental laws and regulations

antitrust laws 

the us federal government most us states and many other countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of these laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages 

exportimport compliance 

the company is required to comply with various us exportimport control and economic sanctions laws including 

 other nations’ governments have implemented similar exportimport control and economic sanction regulations which may affect the company’s operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

the company’s products and services are available worldwide and its principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia the company also has operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows the company to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides greater stability to its operations allows the company to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers the company an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition the company believes that future growth depends in part on its ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target highgrowth markets 

the manner in which the company’s products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of the company’s sales in nonus markets are made by its subsidiaries located outside the united states though the company also sells directly from the united states into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors and in some cases directly in countries with low sales volumes the company generally sells through representatives and distributors 

in a referendum on june 23 2016 voters approved for the united kingdom “uk” to exit the eu “brexit” the uk formally withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 with a transition period through december 31 2020 during the transition period the uk will continue to follow eu law and will negotiate with the eu on the terms of its relationship post2020 with the terms and the nature of the uk’s future relationship with the eu still being decided the company continues to monitor the status of the negotiations and plan for potential impacts to mitigate the potential impact of brexit on the import and export of goods to and from the uk the company has increased its warehouse capacity and the level of inventory within the uk for goods the company manufactures within the uk and exports to other countries the company has manufactured and shipped additional goods for storage in countries outside the uk in an effort to maintain inventory required to meet customer demand in the event of disruption in shipments from the uk the ultimate impact of brexit on the company’s financial results is uncertain the company has seven manufacturing facilities in the uk and for the year ended december 31 2019 less than 5 of our sales were derived from customers located in the uk however the impact of brexit could also impact our sales outside the uk 

information about the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the company’s business is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” included in this annual report for a discussion of risks related to the company’s nonus operations and foreign currency exchange refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

major customers 

no customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated sales in 2019  2018 or 2017  

available information 

the company maintains an internet website at wwwdanahercom the company makes available free of charge on the website its annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with or furnishing such material to the sec danaher’s internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions economic conditions geopolitical events changes in laws regulations or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns including epidemics natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity financial condition and stock price 

we may not complete the ge biopharma acquisition within the time frame we anticipate or at all regulatory approval of the ge biopharma acquisition is subject to conditions and the ge biopharma acquisition could negatively impact our business financial statements and stock price 



 the ge biopharma acquisition discussed above would constitute danaher’s largest acquisition to date based on purchase price would expand danaher’s business into new fields and involves a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges any of these risks or challenges could adversely affect our business financial statements and stock price 

our outstanding debt has increased significantly in anticipation of the ge biopharma acquisition and we expect to incur additional debt in the future our existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 217 billion in outstanding indebtedness including approximately 108 billion of longterm debt we issued in 2019 to fund a portion of the purchase price of the ge biopharma acquisition in addition we had the ability to incur approximately 49 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the company’s 2020 credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances we expect to incur approximately 20 billion of additional indebtedness additional to indebtedness incurred as of december 31 2019 to fund a portion of the purchase price of the ge biopharma acquisition 

our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and other investments 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates 

we anticipate that the indebtedness we have incurred and expect to incur in connection with the ge biopharma acquisition will result in a negative change to our credit ratings compared to our credit rating prior to the public announcement of the ge biopharma acquisition the recent bonds issued by dh europe finance ii sarl “danaher international ii” and guaranteed by danaher corporation were rated bbb by standard  poors and baa1 by moody’s each two notches below danaher’s current longterm unsecured debt credit rating upon closing the ge biopharma acquisition we expect danaher’s longterm unsecured debt credit rating to be downgraded to mirror that of the bonds issued by danaher international ii this anticipated reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that have been available to us prior to the ge biopharma acquisition if our credit ratings are further downgraded or put on watch for a further potential downgrade we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained 

our 2020 credit facilities and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets and a requirement under the 2020 credit facilities to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity of 065 to 10 or less if we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

if we incur additional debt in the future the risks described above would increase 

conditions in the global economy the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment or underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade fiscal tax and monetary policies changes in capital requirements for financial institutions government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

significant developments or uncertainties stemming from the us administration including changes in us trade policies tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto particularly china can have an adverse effect on our business 

changes potential changes or uncertainties in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate or governing the health care system and drug prices can adversely affect our business and financial statements for example the us administration has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states raised the possibility of imposing significant additional tariff increases and called for substantial changes to trade agreements in particular trade tensions between the united states and china have escalated and each country has imposed significant additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country china accounted for approximately 13 of our sales in 2019 these factors have adversely affected and in the future could further adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes marketing or promotional programs new product introductions the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors refer to “item 1 business—competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets in addition significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems safety alerts and publications about products reflecting the competitive significance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in our industry our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses in addition the company’s competitors and customers have from time to time introduced and may in the future introduce private label generic or lowcost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points competitors’ products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall resulting in an adverse effect on the company’s financial statements 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 



if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in rd of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we often incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice competitors may also develop aftermarket services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems including our code of conduct always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance economic and trade sanctions money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct and material violations of such code of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation ability to do business and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the us fda by other federal and state governmental agencies by comparable agencies of other countries and regions by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugsof abuse or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulations please see “regulatory matters—medical device regulations” for more information failure to meet these requirements adversely impacts our business in the applicable geographies 

to varying degrees these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance such as 510k clearance or approvals for our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained even after initial regulatory clearance or approval we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use which could reduce the product’s market acceptance failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of these regulations failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share remediation and increased compliance costs recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products injunctions administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product suspension or withdrawal of approvals and premarket notification rescissions we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse research and development pricing and sales and 

marketing practices the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards including the federal regulations described in “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations involves substantial costs it is also possible that government authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations agency guidance or case law 

noncompliance with the laws and regulations referenced above can result in among other things fines expenses injunctions civil penalties recalls or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance of devices withdrawal of marketing approvals criminal prosecutions and other adverse effects referenced below under “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business including our reputation” further defending against any such actions can be costly and timeconsuming and may require significant personnel resources therefore even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us our business may be impaired 

our products are subject to clinical trials the results of which may be unexpected or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or a regulator’s or the market’s perception of this clinical data can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements 

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties 

the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products in particular any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we can be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties it is also possible that other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an offlabel use which could result in significant penalties including but not limited to criminal civil and administrative penalties substantial monetary penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs andor the curtailment of our operations any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements 

certain modifications to our products may require new 510k clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products 

once a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the united states pursuant to a 510k clearance a manufacturer may be required to notify the fda of certain modifications to the device manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510k clearance or premarket submission but the fda may review any manufacturer’s decision the fda may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary we have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable fda regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510k clearances or other premarket submissions were not required we may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510k clearance if the fda disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510k notifications we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs which could adversely affect our financial statements 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs including the following 



example the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 or pama introduced a multiyear pricing program for services payable under the clinical laboratory fee schedule “clfs” that is designed to bring medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers it is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services but to the extent our customers conclude that medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products other countries as well as some private payors also control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations tying reimbursement to outcomes or in the case of governmental entities through compulsory licensing global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement 

 these changes as well as other impacts from market demand government regulations thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is delivered reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors heighten clinical data requirements reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions and investments has resulted and may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments 

our acquisition of businesses investments joint ventures and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions refer to mda for additional details acquisitions investments joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements 



 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest spinoff splitoff or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment for example in 2015 danaher separated and splitoff to danaher shareholders the majority of its former communications business in a reverse morris trust transaction with netscout systems inc the “communications disposition” in 2016 danaher separated and spunoff to danaher shareholders its former test  measurement segment industrial technologies segment excluding the product identification businesses and retailcommercial petroleum business collectively known as fortive corporation the “fortive disposition” and in 2019 danaher consummated the separation and initial public offering “ipo” and subsequent splitoff of its dental segment known as envista holdings corporation the “envista disposition” transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions can dilute the company’s earnings per share have other adverse financial tax and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes can arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we or our predecessors have sold or 

disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

we could incur significant liability if any of the 2015 separation and splitoff of our communications business the 2016 separation and spinoff of fortive or the 2019 separation ipo and splitoff of envista is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the communications disposition the fortive disposition and the envista disposition qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code these opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the internal revenue service “irs” could determine on audit that any such transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion if any such transaction is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2015 separation and splitoff of our communications business the 2016 separation and spinoff of fortive or the 2019 separation ipo and splitoff of envista could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements 

with respect to each of the communications disposition the fortive disposition and the envista disposition we entered into a separation agreement and related agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and the relationship between the respective companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party that can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty if we are required to indemnify any of the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between danaher and such other parties and require danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are provided andor managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations in addition some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes these systems products and services including those we acquire through business acquisitions may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate attacks may also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services or security breaches of third party systems we rely on to process store or transmit electronic information could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers patients or suppliers like most multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer patient business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services 

legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences business consequences and litigation as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business please see “regulatory matters  data privacy and security laws” for additional information entities that are found to be in violation of hipaa as the result of a breach of unsecured patient health information a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the hhs may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative fines and penalties andor additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with hhs to settle allegations of hipaa noncompliance failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions there is also a new broad privacy law in california the ccpa which came into effect in january 2020 the ccpa has some of the same features as the gdpr and has already prompted several other states to follow with similar laws government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements in addition compliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the united states and around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures and may require further changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and impose endoflife disposal and takeback programs we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire have been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws can result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements 

in addition we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we can also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2019 will have a material effect on our financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business including our reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety health care medical device anticorruption data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this annual report our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 



employees and between our subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory in addition from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures have prevented and will prevent violations of these regulations and any violation can adversely affect our reputation business and financial statements 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and can be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations can result in import detentions fines damages civil and administrative penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts disbarment from selling to certain governmental agencies or exclusion from government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of noncompliance disruption of our business limitation on our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services loss of customers significant legal and investigatory fees disgorgement individual imprisonment reputational harm contractual damages diminished profits curtailment or restricting of business operations criminal prosecution and other monetary and nonmonetary penalties compliance with these and other regulations can also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules can result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements for additional information regarding these risks refer to “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

our restructuring actions can have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and can slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions moreover we may not succeed in implementing present or future restructuring activities or cost reduction activities realizing the anticipated benefits from these initiatives if any benefits are achieved at all can take several years and we may be unable to achieve our targeted cost efficiencies and profit margin improvements additionally we may have insufficient access to capital to fund investments in these strategic initiatives or our business strategy may change from time to time which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2019  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 325 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates can impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which can from time to time require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar adversely affects the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening of the us dollar generally results in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency can also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments can affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities can result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous nonus jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” was enacted the tcja significantly revised the us federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate to 210 implementing a quasiterritorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on unremitted cumulative nonus earnings of foreign subsidiaries “transition tax” 

due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the tcja the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities can be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected please refer to mda for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from periodtoperiod 

in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities such as the audits described in mda and the company’s consolidated financial statements if audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our results can include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements can be adversely affected in particular the irs’ proposed adjustments to certain of the company’s historical taxable income with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the company’s selfinsurance programs and the danish tax authority’s assessments purporting to impose withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on historical borrowings from certain of the company’s subsidiaries each as further discussed in mda and the company’s consolidated financial statements each could take many years to resolve and could ultimately result in a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its cash flows and effective tax rates any further significant changes to the tax system in the united states or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below could also adversely affect our financial statements 

changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position 

the us congress government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules to address base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the united states and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes breach of contract claims competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory subpoenas requests for information investigations and enforcement we also from time to time become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with businesses divested by us or our predecessors the types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages and in some cases treble damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits can divert our management’s attention we from time to time incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we can be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period can require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments can adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with current and future litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2019 will have a material effect on our financial statements 

from time to time we become aware through our internal audits and other internal control procedures employees or other parties of possible compliance matters such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting internal controls financial reporting auditing or ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws when we become aware of such possible compliance matters we investigate internally and take appropriate corrective action internal investigations can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal or regulatory proceedings against us and adversely affect our financial statements 

if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or if thirdparties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the united states 

many of the markets we serve are technologydriven and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing in some circumstances enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that thirdparties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights can adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statements 

these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information intellectual property technology and other assets comparable to the united states the risks we encounter in such countries include the following 



 any of these risks can adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statements refer to “—international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements” for a discussion of additional risks relating to our international operations 

thirdparties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties’ intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others disputes or litigations regarding intellectual property can be costly and timeconsuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others be required to cease marketing manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign reengineer or rebrand our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statements thirdparty intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations when we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others we are not always able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms if at all even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

the us government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a thirdparty if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property 

certain technology licensed by us under agreements with thirdparty licensors is subject to government rights government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a governmentfunded program can include a nonexclusive royaltyfree worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us or our licensors as applicable to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a thirdparty if they determine that 1 adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use 2 such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or 3 such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations further the government rights include the right to use and disclose without limitation technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services or allegations thereof can adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to “off label” use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or 

sell including items that we source from thirdparties can lead to personal injury death property damage loss of profits or other liability these events can lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants government agencies and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our reputation business and financial statements could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the fda and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products an alternative manufacturer is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs liability and lost revenue loss of market share as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners can adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns can adversely affect our business and financial statements the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels also impacts our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries can adversely impact our business and financial statements 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development supply and marketing of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies relying on collaborative relationships is risky because among other things our collaborative partners may 1 not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations 2 fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner 3 be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent 4 compete with us 5 disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship 6 have insufficient capital resources and 7 decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business—materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities including metallicbased components electronic components chemicals plastics and other petroleumbased products prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to when commodity prices rise we are not always able to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset 

these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs our margins and profitability could decline and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services can cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from thirdparties for use in our manufacturing operations including metallicbased components electronic components chemicals plastics and other petroleumbased products our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers from time to time extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance regulatory requirements cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors can result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements 

changes in governmental regulations can reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change in any of these regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof can reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or restrict our existing activities products and services for example a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies changes in the us fda’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process can have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations can adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines can result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from periodtoperiod 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

certain of our us and nonus employees are subject to collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business including our productivity and reputation 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2019  approximately 63 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in the highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 international business risks have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our financial statements business growth rate competitive position and financial condition 

for example in 2019 we generated approximately 13 of our sales from china accordingly our business financial condition and results of operations can be adversely influenced by political economic and social conditions in china generally additionally china’s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies and it maintains control over china’s economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies further considerable uncertainty exists regarding the longterm effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies including the united states and china uncertainty or adverse changes to economic conditions in china or the policies of china’s government or its laws and regulations can have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china and can impact our business and operating results reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our financial statements business growth rate and competitive position and financial condition 

in addition our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics such as the novel strain of coronavirus that recently originated in china covid19 which could adversely impact our operations supply chains and distribution systems and reduce demand for our products and services while we believe the coronavirus may have a negative impact on our financial results the impact is difficult to assess at this time 

significant developments stemming from the uk’s referendum decision to exit the eu could have an adverse effect on us 

in a referendum on june 23 2016 voters in the uk voted for the uk to exit the eu the uk formally withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 with a transition period through december 31 2020 during the transition period the uk will continue to follow eu law and will negotiate with the eu on the terms of its relationship as it stands the terms and the nature of the 

uk’s future relationship with the eu post2020 are still being decided this referendum and withdrawal has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations if no agreement is reached by december 31 2020 the uk’s membership in the eu could terminate under a socalled “hard brexit” the effects of brexit will depend on many factors including any agreements that the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate in a “hard brexit” scenario there could be increased costs from reimposition of tariffs on trade between the uk and eu shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and temporary shortages of certain goods in addition trade and investment between the uk the eu the united states and other countries will be impacted by the fact that the uk currently operates under the eu’s tax treaties the uk will need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world which could take years to complete we have manufacturing facilities in the uk and depending on the terms of brexit we could become subject to export tariffs and regulatory restrictions that could increase the costs and time related to doing business in europe additionally brexit could result in the uk or the eu significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance or approval of our products that are developed or manufactured in the uk any new regulations could add time and expense to the conduct of our business as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the uk the eu and elsewhere any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements as of december 31 2019 the company had seven manufacturing facilities in the uk and the company’s net investment in plant property and equipment in the uk was 163 million  for the year ended december 31 2019 less than 5 of our sales were derived from customers located in the uk however the impact of brexit could also impact our sales and operations outside the uk 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis including epidemics war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters such as the damage caused to our facilities by hurricane maria in puerto rico in september 2017 if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees can increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements

uk’s referendum decision to exit the eu 

in a referendum on june 23 2016 voters approved for the uk to exit the eu the uk formally withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 with a transition period through december 31 2020 during the transition period the uk will continue to follow eu law and will negotiate with the eu on the terms of its relationship post2020 failure to complete negotiations by the implementation deadline of december 31 2020 relating to brexit could result in the uk reverting to undesirable and adverse trade agreements with the eu the nature of the uk’s future relationship with the eu is still uncertain the company continues to monitor the status of brexit and plan for potential impacts as of december 31 2019 the company had seven manufacturing facilities in the uk and the company’s net investment in plant property and equipment in the uk was 163 million for the year ended december 31 2019 less than 5 of the company’s sales were derived from customers located in the uk however the impact of brexit could also impact the company’s sales and operations outside the uk to mitigate the potential impact of brexit on the import of goods to the uk the company has increased its level of inventory within the uk the ultimate impact of brexit on the company’s financial results is uncertain for additional information refer to the “item 1a—risk factors” section of this annual report

results of operations 

in this report references to the nongaap measure of core sales also referred to as core revenues or salesrevenues from existing businesses refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 

 references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit as applicable attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between 

 core sales growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of core sales growth provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to danaher’s peers management also uses core sales growth to measure the company’s operating and financial performance and uses it as one of the performance measures in the company’s executive shortterm cash incentive program the company excludes the effect of currency translation from core sales because currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiturerelated items because the nature size timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from periodtoperiod and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult 

throughout this discussion references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of dbs

cost of sales and gross profit

operating expenses 



sga expenses as a percentage of sales declined 40 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2019 compared with 2018  the decline was driven by increased leverage of the company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2019 sales volumes and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2019 and 2018  partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and transaction costs and integration preparation costs associated with the anticipated ge biopharma acquisition which increased sga as a percentage of sales by approximately 50 basis points during 2019

interest costs 

interest expense of 109 million for 2019 was 28 million lower than in 2018  due primarily to the impact of the company’s crosscurrency swap derivative contracts and the repayment of certain outstanding borrowings in 2019 partially offset by interest expense from 2019 debt issuances for a further description of the company’s debt as of december 31 2019 refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements interest expense of 137 million in 2018 was 3 million lower than the 2017 interest expense of 140 million due primarily to the decrease in interest costs as a result of the repayment of certain outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2018 and the second and fourth quarters of 2017 lower average outstanding us commercial paper borrowings during 2018 compared to 2017  and the impact of foreign exchange rates in 2018 as compared to 2017 partially offset by the cost of additional nonus debt issued during 2017 

in january 2019 the company entered into approximately 19 billion of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts on its us dollardenominated bonds to effectively convert the company’s us dollardenominated bonds to obligations denominated in danish kroner japanese yen euro and swiss franc and reduce the interest rate from the stated interest rates on the us dollardenominated debt to the interest rates of the swaps as of december 31 2019  approximately 10 billion of the crosscurrency swap derivative contracts remained outstanding 

the company used interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to a portion of the us debt the company issued to fund the ge biopharma acquisition the interest rate swap agreements are agreements in which the company agrees to pay a fixed interest rate based on the rate specified in the agreement in exchange for receiving a floating interest rate from a thirdparty bank based upon a specified benchmark interest rate in june 2019 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of 850 million these contracts which were settled in november 2019 effectively fixed the interest rate for a portion of the company’s us dollardenominated debt issued in november 2019 equal to the notional amount of the swaps to the rate specified in the interest rate swap agreements the changes in the fair value of these instruments resulting from the changes in interest rates were recorded as a loss of 38 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity prior to the issuance of the debt and are subsequently being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as further discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations such as the tcja and legislative policy changes that may result from the oecd’s initiative on base erosion and profit shifting for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states refer to “—liquidity and capital resources—cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was enacted substantially changing the us tax system under the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 “ sab no 118 ” guidance for the year ended december 31 2017 the company recorded provisional amounts in earnings for the enactment of the tcja and during 2018 the company completed its accounting for the tcja based on the company’s interpretation of the new tax regulations and related guidance issued by the us department of the treasury and the irs 

the tcja imposes tax on us shareholders for global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” earned by certain foreign subsidiaries the company has elected the period cost method for its accounting for gilti 

due to the complexity and recent issuance of these tax regulations management’s interpretations of the impact of these rules could be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities 

yearoveryear changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate 



the company’s effective tax rate for 2019  2018 and 2017 differs from the us federal statutory rates of 210 in 2019 and 2018 and 350 in 2017 due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates different than the us federal statutory rate in addition 



allowances associated with certain foreign tax credits tax benefits resulting from changes in tax law and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation  

 the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions the nonus countries in which the company has a significant presence include china denmark germany singapore switzerland and the united kingdom the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company’s taxable income 

the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the irs has completed substantially all of the examinations of the company’s federal income tax returns through 2011 and is currently examining certain of the company’s federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2017 in addition the company has subsidiaries in austria belgium canada china denmark france germany hong kong india italy japan korea switzerland the united kingdom and various other countries states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2018 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 the irs proposed significant adjustments to the company’s taxable income for the years 2012 through 2015 with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the company’s selfinsurance programs for income tax purposes the recognition of premium income has been deferred in accordance with us tax laws related to insurance the irs is challenging the deferral of premiums for certain types of the company’s selfinsurance policies the proposed adjustments would increase the company’s taxable income over the 2012 through 2015 period by approximately 27 billion  management believes the positions the company has taken in its us tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend these positions due to the enactment of the tcja in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the us corporate tax rate for years after 2017 the company revalued its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 350 to 210  if the company is not successful in defending these assessments the taxes owed to the irs may be computed under the previous 350 statutory tax rate and the company may be required to revalue the related deferred tax liabilities from 210 to 350  which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed would require a charge to future earnings the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its cash flows and effective tax rate 

tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries on december 10 2013 the company received assessments from the danish tax authority “skat” of approximately dkk 18 billion approximately 266 million based on exchange rates as of december 31 2019  including interest through december 31 2019 imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company’s subsidiaries for the years 20042009 the company appealed these assessments to the danish national tax tribunal in 2014 the appeal is pending awaiting the final outcome of other preceding withholding tax cases that were appealed to the danish courts and subsequently to the court of justice of the european union “cjeu” in february 2019 the cjeu decided several of these cases and ruled that the exemption of interest payments from withholding taxes provided in the applicable eu directive should be denied where taxpayers use the directive for abusive or fraudulent purposes and that it is up to the national courts to make this determination this decision of the cjeu now awaits application by the danish high court in the other preceding withholding tax cases 

skat has maintained a similar position related to withholding tax on interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company’s subsidiaries with respect to tax years 20102012 and 20132015 on august 27 2019 and december 16 2019 the company received assessments for these matters of approximately dkk 11 billion including interest through december 31 2019 approximately 159 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2019 for tax years 20102012 and dkk 751 million including interest through december 31 2019 approximately 113 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2019 for tax years 20132015 respectively the company is appealing these assessments as well 

management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions the company intends on pursuing this matter through the danish high court should the appeal to the danish national tax tribunal be unsuccessful the company will continue to monitor decisions of both the danish courts and the cjeu and evaluate the impact of these court rulings on the company’s tax positions in denmark the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its cash flow and effective tax rate 

the company expects its 2020 effective tax rate to be approximately 195 any future legislative changes in the united states including potential tax reform in other jurisdictions could cause the company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to income taxes 

discontinued operations 

as further discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements discontinued operations include the results of envista which was disposed of during the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as an income tax benefit in 2017 related to the fortive businesses that were disposed of during the third quarter of 2016 

in 2019 earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes were 576 million and reflect the operating results of envista prior to the envista disposition and a gain on the disposition of envista of 451 million  net of certain costs associated with the envista disposition including costs related to establishing envista as a standalone entity and legal accounting and investment banking fees in 2018 and 2017 earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes were 245 million and 320 million  respectively and reflect the operations of envista as well as a 22 million income tax benefit in 2017 related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain danaher tax returns which were jointly filed with fortive entities these reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns all fortive entityrelated balances are included in the income tax benefit related to discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2017 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income increased by approximately 726 million in 2019 as compared to 2018  primarily due to a decrease in losses from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018 and higher net earnings including those attributable to discontinued operations partially offset by an increase in losses from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018 and losses from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2019  the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of 75 million for 2019 compared to a translation loss of 632 million for 2018  the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of 90 million for 2019 compared to a loss of 13 million for 2018  the company recorded losses from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2019 of 113 million  

comprehensive income decreased by approximately 15 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017  primarily due to a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2018 compared to a gain in 2017 and a loss from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments in 2018 as compared to a gain in 2017  partially offset by higher net earnings including those attributable to discontinued operations and a decrease in unrealized losses on availableforsale securities in 2018 compared to 2017  the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of 632 million for 2018 compared to a translation gain of 976 million for 2017  the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of 13 million in 2018 compared to a gain of 71 million in 2017  

inflation 

the effect of inflation on the company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31 2019  2018 or 2017  

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk each of which could impact its consolidated financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on fixed rate longterm debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2019  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock by approximately 17 billion 

as of december 31 2019  the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of eurobased commercial paper borrowings refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2019  as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature the company may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2019  the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately negative 19 basis points a hypothetical increase of this average to negative 12 basis points would have increased the company’s annual interest expense by 2 million the hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the company’s commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2019  

refer to “results of operations—interest costs” for discussion of the company’s crosscurrency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements 

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into us dollars danaher’s functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders’ equity 

currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2019 reported sales by 20 on a yearoveryear basis primarily as a result of the us dollar strengthening against other major currencies if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2019 were to prevail throughout 2020  currency exchange rates would slightly increase 2020 estimated sales relative to 2019 sales strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2019 would adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2019 would positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk although the company has used foreign currencydenominated debt and crosscurrency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the company’s consolidated financial statements in addition the company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2019 would have reduced foreign currencydenominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by approximately 830 million in 2019 the company entered into approximately 19 billion of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts on its us dollardenominated bonds to hedge its net investment in foreign operations against adverse changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the danish kroner japanese yen euro and the swiss franc these contracts effectively convert the company’s us dollardenominated bonds to obligations denominated in danish kroner japanese yen euro and swiss franc and partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on foreign currencydenominated net assets during the term of the swap as of december 31 2019  approximately 10 billion of the crosscurrency swap derivative contracts remained outstanding the company also uses crosscurrency swap derivative contracts to hedge us dollardenominated longterm debt issuances in a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro against adverse movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro in november 2019 the company entered into crosscurrency swap derivative contracts with respect to 

approximately 40 billion of its us dollardenominated bonds and all of these derivative contracts remained outstanding as of december 31 2019  

equity price risk 

the company’s investment portfolio from time to time includes publiclytraded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price though as of december 31 2019 the company held no availableforsale marketable equity securities the company holds nonmarketable equity investments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks or other factors these nonmarketable equity investments are accounted for under the fair value alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require charges or gains to be recognized in earnings 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and typically with highquality financial institutions so that exposure at any one institution is limited 

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and forecasts that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses consummating strategic acquisitions and investments paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis in addition as discussed in further detail above the company received approximately 20 billion of cash from envista as consideration for the transfer of the company’s dental businesses to envista a portion of which consideration the company used to redeem certain of the company’s outstanding indebtedness in the fourth quarter of 2019 

following is an overview of the company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended december 31

 operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 36 billion for 2018  an increase of 522 million  or 17  as compared to 2017  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations in 2018 as compared to 2017  net earnings in 2017 also included a 73 million gain on sale of marketable equity securities for which the proceeds were reflected in the investing activities section of the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows and therefore did not contribute to operating cash flows 

investing activities

financing activities used cash of 797 million during 2018 compared to approximately 31 billion of cash used during 2017 the yearoveryear decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to lower net repayments of commercial paper borrowings in 2018 as the company decreased its commercial paper borrowings in 2017 after increasing commercial paper borrowings for the cepheid acquisition in 2016 the company issued commercial paper early in 2018 to pay for a portion of the acquisition price of idt and repaid substantially all of such commercial paper borrowings later in 2018 the cash outflow in 2017 for the net repayment of commercial paper was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of longterm notes in both 2018 and 2017 the company repaid longterm debt including 500 million aggregate principal amount of us notes with accrued interest that matured in september 2018

during 2019  the company contributed 10 million to its us defined benefit pension plans and 44 million to its nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2020  the company’s cash contribution requirements for its us and its nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 95 million and 40 million  respectively the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 under 1 debt obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on the company’s consolidated balance sheet the amounts presented in the “other longterm liabilities” line in the table below include approximately 13 billion of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and do not include 58 million of current gross unrecognized tax benefits which are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the timing of the longterm portion of these tax liabilities is uncertain and therefore they have been included in the “more than 5 years” column in the table below refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits certain of the company’s acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain refer to “—offbalance sheet arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below 





 offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees and related instruments 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of guarantees and related instruments of the company as of december 31 2019  



guarantees and related instruments consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers insurance providers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company’s obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters employment matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters in particular in connection with the 2019 envista disposition the 2016 fortive disposition and the 2015 communications disposition danaher entered into separation and related agreements pursuant to which danaher agreed to indemnify the other parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future these indemnification obligations cover a variety of liabilities including but not limited to employee tax and environmental matters the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they generally relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company’s financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial statements 

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products software or services or claims alleging that company products or services infringe thirdparty intellectual property the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

refer to “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from periodtoperiod for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

acquired intangibles —the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess rd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur refer to notes 1  3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing its goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a marketbased approach in evaluating the estimates derived by the marketbased approach management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

as of december 31 2019  the company had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2019 indicated that in all instances the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 85 to approximately 600 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 65 to approximately 530 

the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements historically the company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct 

contingent liabilities —as discussed in “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

revenue recognition —the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in determining if control has transferred the company considers whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present such as the transfer of title present right to payment significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality to determine the consideration that the customer owes the company the company must make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates as well as an estimate for product returns the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or salestype leases refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies 

if the company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect historically the company’s estimates of revenue have been materially correct 

pension and other postretirement benefits —for a description of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices refer to notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors the company’s financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 133 million 99 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 137 million 116 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2019  a 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the us net obligation by 122 million 91 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 124 million 105 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2019  

for 2019  the estimated longterm rate of return for the us plans was 70  and the company intends to continue to use an assumption of 70 for 2020  the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a planbyplan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 08 to 50  if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2019 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2019 would have increased 9 million 7 million on an aftertax basis and 5 million 4 million on an aftertax basis respectively 

for a discussion of the company’s 2019 and anticipated 2020 defined benefit pension plan contributions refer to “—liquidity and capital resources—cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes —for a description of the company’s income tax accounting policies refer to notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company’s financial statements 

the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when based upon the technical merits it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when 1 a tax audit is completed 2 applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or 3 the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of the company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark and the united states refer to “—results of operations—income taxes” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its effective tax rate 

an increase of 10 in the company’s 2019 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2019 of 33 million

we intend to spinoff our dental business into an independent publiclytraded company in the second half of 2019 the proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

we have announced our intention to spinoff danaher’s dental business into an independent publiclytraded company in the second half of 2019 subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including obtaining final approval from the danaher board of directors satisfactory completion of financing receipt of tax opinions receipt of favorable rulings from the irs and receipt of other regulatory approvals unanticipated developments including possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings regulatory approvals or clearances and trade qualifications uncertainty of the financial markets or changes in the company’s cash requirements and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable andor different than expected even if the transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spinoff expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management which could distract them from other tasks in 

operating our business following the proposed separation the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred 

conditions in the global economy the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment or underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade fiscal tax and monetary policies changes in capital requirements for financial institutions government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy may adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

significant developments or uncertainties stemming from the us administration including changes in us trade policies tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto could have an adverse effect on our business 

changes potential changes or uncertainties in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate or governing the health care system and drug prices could adversely affect our business and financial statements for example the us administration has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states raised the possibility of imposing significant additional tariff increases and called for substantial changes to trade agreements these factors have adversely affected and in the future could further adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which 

may be affected by announced price changes marketing or promotional programs new product introductions the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors refer to “item 1 business—competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets in addition significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems safety alerts and publications about products reflecting the competitive significance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in our industry our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses in addition the company is exposed to the risk that its competitors or its customers may introduce private label generic or lowcost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points if these competitors’ products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall this could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial statements 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in rd of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice competitors may also develop aftermarket services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation ability to do business and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the us fda by other federal and state governmental agencies by comparable agencies of other countries and regions by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugsof abuse or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulations for example the eu has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until may 2020 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr and until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

to varying degrees these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance such as 510k clearance or approvals for our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained even after initial regulatory clearance or approval we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities and if safety issues arise we may be required to amend conditions for use of a product such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use which could reduce the product’s market acceptance failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of these regulations failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share remediation and increased compliance costs recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products injunctions administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product suspension or withdrawal of approvals and premarket notification rescissions we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information including the federal regulations described in “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business including our reputation” compliance with regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses 

our products are subject to clinical trials the results of which may be unexpected or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or a regulator’s or the market’s perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs which could adversely affect our financial statements 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs including the following 

 these changes as well as other impacts from market demand government regulations thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have started changing the way healthcare is delivered reimbursed and funded and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors heighten clinical data requirements reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions and investments may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments 

our acquisition of businesses investments joint ventures and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions refer to “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details acquisitions investments joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements 



 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest spinoff splitoff or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment for example we splitoff our communications business in 2015 spunoff our fortive business in 2016 and have announced our intention to spinoff our dental business in 2019 transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the company’s earnings per share have other adverse financial tax and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

we could incur significant liability if the anticipated spinoff of our dental business 2016 spinoff of fortive corporation “fortive” or the 2015 splitoff of our communications business is determined to be a taxable transaction 

in july 2015 the company consummated the splitoff of the majority of its former communications business to danaher shareholders who elected to exchange danaher shares for ownership interests in the communications business and the subsequent merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of netscout systems inc danaher shareholders who participated in the exchange offer tendered 26 million shares of danaher common stock approximately 23 billion on the date of tender and received 625 million shares of netscout common stock which represented approximately 60 of the shares of netscout common stock outstanding following the combination 

on july 2 2016 danaher completed the separation the “fortive separation” of its former test  measurement segment industrial technologies segment excluding the product identification businesses and retailcommercial petroleum business by distributing to danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fortive the entity danaher incorporated to hold such businesses to effect the fortive separation danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of fortive common stock for every two shares of danaher common stock outstanding as of june 15 2016 the record date for the distribution 

as noted above we have also announced our intention to spinoff danaher’s dental business into an independent publiclytraded company in the second half of 2019 subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 

we have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the fortive separation in 2016 and the splitoff of our communications business in 2015 qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code and we anticipate receiving a similar opinion with respect to the planned dental spinoff the opinions relating to the fortive spinoff and communications splitoff rely and we anticipate the opinion related to the dental spinoff will rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that any such separations are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion if any such transaction is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2016 spinoff of fortive and the 2015 splitoff of our communications business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with fortive to govern the fortive separation and the relationship between the two companies going forward we entered into similar agreements with netscout systems inc in connection with the splitoff of our communications business and anticipate entering into similar agreements in connection with the spinoff of our dental business these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us if we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between danaher and such other parties and require danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are provided andor managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations in addition some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that may house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers may connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes these systems products and services including those we acquire through business acquisitions may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate attacks may also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers patients or suppliers like most multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer patient business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences business consequences and litigation as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states hipaa privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy the new eu general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data including among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for noncompliance several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements in addition compliance with the varying data privacy regulations around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures and may require changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and impose endoflife disposal and takeback programs we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire have been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks refer to note 17  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2018  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business including our reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety health care medical device anticorruption data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this annual report our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and 

cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements for additional information regarding these risks refer to “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2018  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 376 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in numerous nonus jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” was enacted the tcja significantly revised the us federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate to 210 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on unremitted cumulative nonus earnings of foreign subsidiaries “transition tax” the us treasury department and irs continue to issue regulations with respect to implementing the tcja and further regulations are expected to be issued 

due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the tcja the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected please refer to mda for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from periodtoperiod 

in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities such as the audits described in mda and the company’s consolidated financial statements if audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to 

our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected any further significant changes to the tax system in the united states or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below could adversely affect our financial statements 

changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position 

the us congress government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for addressing base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the united states and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes breach of contract claims competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory subpoenas requests for information investigations and enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses the types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages and in some cases treble damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2018  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if thirdparties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

many of the markets we serve are technologydriven and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that thirdparties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statements 

thirdparties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

the us government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a thirdparty if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property 

certain technology licensed by us under agreements with thirdparty licensors may be subject to government rights government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a governmentfunded program may include a nonexclusive royaltyfree worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us or our licensors as applicable to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a thirdparty if they determine that 1 adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use 2 such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or 3 such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations further the government rights include the right to use and disclose without limitation technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services including software or allegations thereof could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to “off label” use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from thirdparties can lead to personal injury death property damage loss of profits or other liability these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants government agencies and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our reputation business and financial statements could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the fda and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs liability and lost revenue loss of market share as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 97 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition as of december 31 2018  we had the ability to incur approximately an additional 15 billion  of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the company’s 40 billion  credit facility which 

were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances  our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisitions and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase 

our current revolving credit facility and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us for more information refer to mda if we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements in addition any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our business and financial statements   the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development supply and marketing of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies relying on collaborative relationships is risky because among other things our collaborative partners may 1 not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations 2 fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner 3 be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent 4 compete with us 5 disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship 6 have insufficient capital resources and 7 decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business—materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities including metallicbased components electronic components chemicals plastics and other petroleumbased products prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs our margins and profitability could decline and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from thirdparties for use in our manufacturing operations including metallicbased components electronic components chemicals plastics and other petroleumbased products our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance regulatory requirements cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change in any of these regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof could reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services for example a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies changes in the us fda’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from periodtoperiod 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have certain us and nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business including our productivity and reputation 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2018  approximately 63  of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in the highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and business including our growth rate 

significant developments stemming from the united kingdom’s referendum decision to exit the eu could have an adverse effect on us 

in a referendum on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom “uk” voted for the uk to exit the eu referred to as brexit as it stands the uk is expected to depart the eu on march 29 2019 but the terms of its withdrawal and the nature of its future relationship with the eu are still being decided this referendum has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations even if no agreement is reached the uk’s separation still becomes effective unless all eu members unanimously agree on an extension negotiations have commenced to determine the future terms of the uk relationship with the eu including among other things the terms of trade between the uk and the eu if no agreement is reached by march 29 2019 the uk’s membership in the eu could terminate under a socalled “hard brexit” the effects of brexit will depend on many factors including any agreements that the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate in a “hard brexit” scenario there could be increased costs from reimposition of tariffs on trade between the uk and eu shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and temporary shortages of certain goods in addition trade and investment between the uk the eu the united states and other countries will be impacted by the fact that the uk currently operates under the eu’s tax treaties the uk will need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world which could take years to complete we have manufacturing facilities in the uk and depending on the terms of brexit we could become subject to export tariffs and regulatory restrictions that could increase the costs and time related to doing business in europe additionally brexit could result in the uk or the european union significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance or approval of our products 

that are developed or manufactured in the uk any new regulations could add time and expense to the conduct of our business as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the uk the eu and elsewhere any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements as of december 31 2018 the company’s net investment in plant property and equipment in the uk was 157 million for the year ended december 31 2018 less than 3 of our sales were derived from customers located in the uk however the impact of brexit could also impact our sales and operations outside the uk 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters such as the damage caused to our facilities by hurricane maria in puerto rico in september 2017 if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements

overview 

general 

refer to “item 1 business—general” for a discussion of danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering longterm shareholder value danaher is a multinational business with global operations during 2018  approximately 63  of danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a diversified global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of its products software and services help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results given the broad range of products manufactured software and services provided and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of the company’s geographic and industry diversity the company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges including rapid technological development particularly with respect to computing automation artificial intelligence mobile connectivity communications and digitization in most of the company’s served markets the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force consolidation of the company’s competitors and increasing regulation the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and the company’s longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in highgrowth geographies and highgrowth market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins expand and improve the effectiveness of the company’s sales force continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment the company is making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources particularly in highgrowth markets in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations 

business performance 

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2018   increased   85  as compared to 2017  while differences exist among the company’s businesses on an overall basis demand for the company’s products and services increased on a yearoveryear basis in 2018  as compared to 2017  this demand together with the company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other businessspecific factors discussed below contributed to yearoveryear core sales growth of 60  for the definition of “core sales” refer to “—results of operations” below geographically both highgrowth and developed markets contributed to yearoveryear core sales growth during 2018  core sales growth rates in highgrowth markets grew at a highsingle digit rate in 2018  as compared to 2017  led by strength in asia particularly china highgrowth markets represented approximately 31  of the company’s total sales in 2018  core sales in developed markets grew at a midsingle digit rate in 2018  as compared to 2017  and were driven by north america and western europe 

the company’s net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2018 totaled approximately 27 billion  or 374  per diluted share compared to approximately 25 billion  or 350  per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2017 

the company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of 3 million as of january 1 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  the impact to beginning retained earnings was primarily driven by the capitalization of certain costs to obtain a contract primarily salesrelated commissions partially offset by the deferral of revenue for unfulfilled performance obligations  the adoption of this asu did not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended  december 31 2018 and as a result comparisons of revenues and operating profit performance between periods are not affected by the adoption of this  asu refer to note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

fortive separation and proposed dental separation 

on july 2 2016 danaher completed the separation of its former test  measurement segment industrial technologies segment excluding the product identification businesses and retailcommercial petroleum business by distributing to danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fortive  the entity danaher incorporated to hold such businesses to effect the fortive separation danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of fortive common stock for every two shares of danaher common stock outstanding as of june 15 2016 the record date for the distribution 

during the second quarter of 2016 the company received net cash distributions of approximately 30 billion  from fortive as consideration for the company’s contribution of assets to fortive in connection with the separation “fortive distribution”  danaher used a portion of the cash distribution proceeds to repay the 500 million   aggregate principal amount of 23  senior unsecured notes that matured in june 2016 and to redeem approximately 19 billion  in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in august 2016 consisting of the  company’s 5625  senior unsecured notes due 2018 54  senior unsecured notes due 2019 and 39  senior unsecured notes due 2021  collectively the “redeemed notes”  danaher also paid an aggregate of 188 million   in makewhole premiums in connection with the august 2016 redemptions plus accrued and unpaid interest   the company used the balance of the fortive distribution to fund certain of the company’s regular quarterly cash dividends to shareholders 

the accounting requirements for reporting the fortive separation as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed accordingly the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation the company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense and income to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business’ net assets to the company’s consolidated net assets   fortive had revenues of approximately 30 billion  in 2016 prior to the fortive separation

results of operations 

in this report references to the nongaap measure of core sales also referred to as core revenues or salesrevenues from existing businesses refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 

 references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit as applicable attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between 

 core sales  growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of core sales  growth provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to danaher’s peers management also uses core sales  growth to measure the company’s operating and financial performance the company excludes the effect of currency translation from core sales  because currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiturerelated items because the nature size timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from periodtoperiod and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult 

throughout this discussion references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of dbs

interest costs 

interest expense of 157 million  for 2018  was 5 million   lower  than in 2017  due primarily to the decrease in interest costs as a result of the repayment of certain outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2018 and the second and fourth quarters of 2017 lower average outstanding us commercial paper borrowings during 2018  compared to 2017  and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 as compared to 2017 partially offset by the cost of additional nonus debt issued during

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations including the tcja and legislative policy changes that may result from the oecd’s initiative on base erosion and profit shifting for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states refer to “—liquidity and capital resources—cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

on december 22 2017 the tcja  was enacted substantially changing the us tax system and affecting the company in a number of ways notably the tcja   

 while the changes from the tcja were generally effective beginning in 2018 gaap accounting for income taxes requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the tcja  sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 “ sab no 118 ” allowed the company to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended december 31 

2017 where reasonable estimates could be made the provisional accounting was based on such estimates when no reasonable estimate could be made sab no 118 required the accounting to be based on the tax law in effect before the tcja the company was required to complete its tax accounting for the tcja when it had obtained prepared and analyzed the information to complete the income tax accounting but no later than december 22 2018   

accordingly during 2018 the company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja based on the company’s interpretation of the new tax regulations and related guidance issued by the us department of the treasury and the irs   

 due to the complexity and recent issuance of these tax regulations management’s interpretations of the impact of these rules could be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities 

yearoveryear changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate 



the company’s effective tax rate for 2018  2017  and 2016  differs from the us federal statutory rates of 210  for 2018 and 350  for 2017 and 2016  due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates different than the us federal statutory rate in addition   



 the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions the nonus countries in which the company has a significant presence include china denmark germany singapore switzerland and the united kingdom the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company’s taxable income   

the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the irs  has completed substantially all of the examinations of the company’s federal income tax returns through 2011 and is currently examining certain of the company’s federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2015 in addition the company has subsidiaries in austria belgium canada china denmark finland france germany hong kong india italy japan new zealand sweden switzerland the united kingdom and various other countries states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2017   

in the fourth quarter of 2018 the irs proposed significant adjustments to the company’s taxable income for the years 2012 through 2015 with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the company’s selfinsurance programs the proposed adjustments would increase the company’s taxable income over the 2012 through 2015 period by approximately   960 million  in addition as of december 31 2018 the irs has notified the company that it is considering additional taxable income adjustments related to other aspects of the company’s selfinsurance programs for the years 2012 through 2015 these additional proposed adjustments would increase the company’s taxable income by approximately 17 billion  management believes the positions the company has taken in its us tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws intends to vigorously defend these positions and is currently considering all of its alternatives due to the enactment of the tcja in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the us corporate tax rate for years after 2017 the company revalued its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 350  to 210  if the company is not successful in defending these assessments the taxes owed to the irs may be computed under the previous 350  statutory tax rate and the company may be required to revalue the related deferred tax liabilities from 210  to 350  which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed would require a charge to future earnings the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements including its cash flows and effective tax rate   

tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries on december 10 2013 the company received assessments from the danish tax authority “skat” totaling approximately   dkk 16 billion  approximately 247 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2018   including interest through december 31 2018 imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2009 the company is currently in discussions with skat and anticipates receiving an assessment for years 2010 through 2012 totaling approximately dkk 954 million  approximately 146 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2018  including interest through december 31 2018    management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions the company appealed these assessments with the national tax tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the european court of justice should this appeal be unsuccessful the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements including its cash flows and effective tax rate   

after considering the effect of the tcja the company expects its 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 195 any future legislative changes in the united states including new regulations related to the tcja or potential tax reform in other jurisdictions could cause the company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate refer to note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to income taxes 

discontinued operations 

as further discussed in note 4  to the consolidated financial statements discontinued operations include the results of the fortive businesses which were disposed of during the third quarter of 2016 

in 2017 danaher recorded a 22 million  income tax benefit related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain danaher tax returns which were jointly filed with fortive entities these reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns all fortive entityrelated balances were included in 

the income tax benefit related to discontinued operations    

in 2016 earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes  were 400 million  and reflected the operating results of the fortive businesses prior to the fortive separation 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income decreased  by approximately 15 billion  in 2018  as compared to 2017  primarily due to a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2018 compared to a gain in 2017  and a loss from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments as compared to a gain in 2017 partially offset by higher net earnings from continuing operations and a decrease in unrealized losses on availableforsale securities in 2018  compared to 2017  the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss  of 632 million  for 2018  compared to a translation gain  of 976 million  for 2017  the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss  of 13 million  for 2018  compared to a gain  of 71 million  for 2017  these negative impacts were partially offset by higher net earnings in 2018  compared to 2017  

comprehensive income increased  by approximately 17 billion  in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily due to increased earnings from continuing operations an increased gain from foreign currency translation adjustments compared to 2016  pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments and the decrease in unrealized losses on availableforsale securities partially offset by lower net earnings attributable to discontinued operations in 2017  compared to 2016  the company recorded a foreign currency translation gain  of 976 million  for 2017  compared to a translation loss  of 517 million  for 2016  the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain  of 71 million  in 2017  compared to a loss  of 58 million  in 2016  

inflation 

the effect of inflation on the company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31 2018  2017  or 2016  

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk each of which could impact its consolidated financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company may periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2018  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock by 460 million 

as of december 31 2018  the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurobased commercial paper borrowings refer to note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2018  as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature the company may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2018  the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately negative 18 basis points a hypothetical increase of this average to negative eight basis points would have increased the company’s annual interest expense by 3 million the hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the company’s commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2018  

in january 2019 the company entered into approximately 19 billion  of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts on its us dollar denominated bonds to effectively convert the company’s us dollar denominated bonds to obligations denominated in danish kroner japanese yen euro and swiss franc based on the interest rates of the swaps and current currency exchange 

rates the company expects these contracts to reduce the company’s interest expense in 2019 by approximately 35 million  versus the stated interest rates on the us dollar denominated debt 

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into us dollars danaher’s functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders’ equity 

currency exchange rates positively  impacted 2018  reported sales by 05  on a yearoveryear basis primarily as a result of the us dollar weakening against other major currencies in the first half of 2018  the us dollar strengthened in the second half of 2018  which mitigated some of the benefit recorded in early 2018  if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2018  were to prevail throughout 2019  currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2019  estimated sales by 15 relative to the company’s performance in 2018  strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the company’s consolidated financial statements in addition the company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies the company may also use foreign currencydenominated debt and crosscurrency swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2018  would have reduced foreign currencydenominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by 860 million in 2019 the company entered into approximately 19 billion  of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts on its us dollardenominated bonds to hedge its net investment in foreign operations against adverse changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the danish kroner japanese yen euro and the swiss franc these contracts effectively convert the company’s us dollardenominated bonds to obligations denominated in danish kroner japanese yen euro and swiss franc and will partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on foreign currencydenominated net assets in future periods 

equity price risk 

the company’s investment portfolio has in the past included publiclytraded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price however during 2017 the company sold substantially all of its availableforsale marketable equity securities the company also holds investments in nonmarketable equity instruments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks or other factors these nonmarketable equity investments are accounted for under the fair value alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require charges or gains to be recognized in earnings 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and such transactions are generally insignificant to the company’s financial condition and results of operations these transactions are typically entered into with highquality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited 

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing requirements the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses consummating strategic acquisitions and investments paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis

 operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 35 billion  for 2017  an increase  of 390 million  or 13  as compared to 2016  this increase  was primarily attributable to the increase  in net earnings from continuing operations in 2017  as compared to 2016

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  under 1 debt obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on the company’s consolidated balance sheet the amounts presented in the “other longterm liabilities” line in the table below include 911 million  of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and do not include 75 million  of current gross unrecognized tax benefits which are included in the “accrued expenses and other liabilities” line on the consolidated balance sheet however the timing of the longterm portion of these tax liabilities is uncertain and therefore they have been included in the “more than 5 years” column in the table below refer to note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits certain of the company’s acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain refer to “—offbalance sheet arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below 





liabilities and deferred compensation obligations the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees and related instruments 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of guarantees and related instruments of the company as of december 31 2018  



guarantees and related instruments consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers insurance providers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company’s obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters in particular in connection with the 2016 fortive separation and the 2015 splitoff of the company’s communications business danaher entered into separation and distribution and related agreements pursuant to which danaher agreed to indemnify the other parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future these indemnification obligations cover a variety of liabilities including but not limited to employee tax and environmental matters the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company’s financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to thirdparties in the event any of these thirdparties vacate any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products software or services or claims alleging that company products or services infringe thirdparty intellectual property the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from periodtoperiod for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

acquired intangibles —the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess rd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur refer to notes 1  3  and 7  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing its goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a marketbased approach in evaluating the estimates derived by the marketbased approach management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

as of december 31 2018  the company had eight  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing   reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2018  indicated that in all instances the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 15 to approximately 600 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 5 to approximately 530 

the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company’s consolidated financial statements historically the company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct 

contingent liabilities —as discussed in “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 17  to the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 17  to the consolidated financial statements if 

the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

revenue recognition — on january 1 2018 the company adopted  asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which supersedes nearly all previous revenue recognition guidance   refer to note 2  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company’s adoption of this asu 

the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in determining if control has transferred the company considers whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present such as the transfer of title present right to payment significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality to determine the consideration that the customer owes the company the company must make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates as well as an estimate for product returns the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or salestype leases certain of the company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria refer to note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies 

if the company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect historically the company’s estimates of revenue have been materially correct 

pension and other postretirement benefits —for a description of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices refer to notes 11  and 12  to the consolidated financial statements calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors the company’s consolidated financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 121 million 92 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 125 million 96 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018  a 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the us net obligation by 111 million 84 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 120 million 93 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018  

for 2018  the estimated longterm rate of return for the us plans is 70  and the company intends to continue to use an assumption of 70  for 2019  the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a planbyplan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 10  to 58  if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2018  was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2018  would have increased 10 million 8 million on an aftertax basis and 6 million 5 million on an aftertax basis respectively 

for a discussion of the company’s 2018  and anticipated 2019  defined benefit pension plan contributions refer to “—liquidity and capital resources—cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes —for a description of the company’s income tax accounting policies refer to notes 1  and 13  to the consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when based upon the technical merits it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when 1 a tax audit is completed 2 applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or 3 the applicable statute of limitations expires 

on december 22 2017 the tcja  was enacted which substantially changed the us tax system including lowering the corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 beginning in 2018    while the changes from the tcja were generally effective 

beginning in 2018 gaap accounting for income taxes requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the tcja  sab no 118 allowed the company to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended december 31 2017 where reasonable estimates could be made the provisional accounting was based on such estimates when no reasonable estimate could be made sab no 118 required the accounting to be based on the tax law in effect before the tcja the company was required to complete its tax accounting for the tcja when it had obtained prepared and analyzed the information to complete the income tax accounting but no later than december 22 2018   the company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja based on the company’s interpretation of the new tax regulations and related guidance the net tax effect to adjust the prior year provisional amounts was not material to the company’s financial statements due to the complexity and recent issuance of these tax regulations management’s interpretations of the impact of these rules could be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities some or all of these judgments are also subject to review by the irs if the irs were to successfully challenge the company’s right to realize some or all of the tax benefit the company has recorded or its interpretation of the law regarding certain items or if the amount of the transition tax or other tax liabilities are understated it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial statements 

in addition certain of the company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark and the united states refer to “—results of operations—income taxes” and note 13  to the consolidated financial statements management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements including its effective tax rate 

an increase of 10 in the company’s 2018  nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2018  of 33 million

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions economic conditions geopolitical events changes in laws regulations or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment or underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes or anticipation of potential changes in government fiscal tax trade and monetary policies changes in capital requirements for financial institutions government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors refer to “item 1 business—competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets in addition significant shifts in industry market share can occur in connection with product problems safety alerts and publications about products reflecting the competitive significance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in our industry our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in rd of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice competitors may also develop aftermarket services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation ability to do business and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the us fda by other federal and state governmental agencies by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugsof abuse or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance such as 510k clearance or approvals for our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained even after initial regulatory clearance or approval if safety issues arise we may be required to amend conditions for use of a product such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use which could reduce the product’s market acceptance failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of these regulations real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products injunctions administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product suspension or withdrawal of approvals and premarket notification rescissions we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information including the federal regulations described in “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business including our reputation” compliance with regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs which could adversely affect our financial statements 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs including the following 

 these changes as well as other impacts from market demand government regulations thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our acquisition of businesses investments joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions refer to “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details acquisitions investments joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements 

 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest spinoff splitoff or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment for example we splitoff our communications business in 2015 and spunoff our fortive business in 2016 transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the company’s earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

we could incur significant liability if the 2016 spinoff of fortive corporation “fortive” or the 2015 splitoff of our communications business is determined to be a taxable transaction 

in july 2015 the company consummated the splitoff of the majority of its former communications business to danaher shareholders who elected to exchange danaher shares for ownership interests in the communications business and the subsequent merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of netscout danaher shareholders who participated in the exchange offer tendered 26 million shares of danaher common stock approximately 23 billion on the date of tender and received 625 million shares of netscout common stock which represented approximately 60 of the shares of netscout common stock outstanding following the combination 

on july 2 2016 danaher completed the separation the “separation” of its former test  measurement segment industrial technologies segment excluding the product identification businesses and retailcommercial petroleum business by distributing to danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fortive the entity danaher incorporated to hold such businesses to effect the separation danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of fortive common stock for every two shares of danaher common stock outstanding as of june 15 2016 the record date for the distribution 

we have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the fortive separation in 2016 and the splitoff of our communications business in 2015 qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code these opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the internal revenue service “irs” could determine on audit that either or both separations are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion if either transaction is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2016 spinoff of fortive and the 2015 splitoff of our communications business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with fortive to govern the separation and the relationship between the two companies going forward we entered into similar agreements with netscout systems inc in connection with the splitoff of our communications business these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us if we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between danaher and such other parties and require danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations in addition some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that may house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers may connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes these systems products and services may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate attacks may also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like most multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states hipaa privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe and the new eu general data protection regulation which takes effect in may 2018 will impose significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data several countries such as china and russia have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and impose endoflife disposal and takeback programs we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire have been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future 

events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks refer to note 16  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2017  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business including our reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety health care medical device anticorruption data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this annual report our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements for additional information regarding these risks refer to “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or 

failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2017  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 368 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” was enacted the tcja significantly revises the us federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21 beginning in 2018 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on unremitted cumulative nonus earnings of foreign subsidiaries “transition tax” the us treasury department and irs have not yet issued regulations with respect to the tcja 

due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the tcja the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected please refer to mda for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period for example our estimate of the net onetime charge we have incurred related to the tcja could differ materially from our actual liability due to among other things further refinement of our calculations changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made additional guidance that may be issued by the us treasury department and irs and actions we may take as a result of the tcja the impact of the factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from periodtoperiod 

in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities such as the audits described in mda and the company’s financial statements if audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected any further significant changes to the tax system in the united states or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below could adversely affect our financial statements 

changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position 

the us congress government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for addressing base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the united states 

and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses the types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages and in some cases treble damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2017  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if thirdparties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that thirdparties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statements 

thirdparties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

the us government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a thirdparty if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property 

certain technology licensed by us under agreements with thirdparty licensors may be subject to government rights government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a governmentfunded program may include a nonexclusive royaltyfree worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us or our licensors as applicable to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a thirdparty if they determine that 1 adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use 2 such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or 3 such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations further the government rights include the right to use and disclose without limitation technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services including software or allegations thereof could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to “off label” use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from thirdparties can lead to personal injury death property damage loss of profits or other liability these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants government agencies and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our reputation business and financial statements could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the fda and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs liability and lost revenue as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 105 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition as of december 31 2017  we had the ability to incur an additional 16 billion  of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the company’s 40 billion  credit f acility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances  our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisitions and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase 

our current revolving credit facility and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us for more information refer to mda if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements in addition any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our business and financial statements   the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development supply and marketing of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies relying on collaborative relationships is risky because among other things our collaborative partners may 1 not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations 2 fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner 3 be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent 4 compete with us 5 disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship 6 have insufficient capital resources and 7 decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business—materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs our margins and profitability could decline and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from thirdparties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance regulatory requirements cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or 

commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change in any of these regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof could reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services for example a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies changes in the us fda’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from periodtoperiod 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business including our productivity and reputation 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2017  approximately 63  of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in the highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 



 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and business including our growth rate 

significant developments stemming from the current us administration or the united kingdom’s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us 

changes potential changes or uncertainties in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate stemming from the current us administration could adversely affect our business and financial statements for example the current us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement “nafta” has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states and has raised the possibility of imposing significant additional tariff increases 

additionally on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the eu this referendum has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations although it is unknown what the full terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements

results of operations 

in this report references to the nongaap measure of core sales also referred to as core revenues or sales from existing businesses refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 

 references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit as applicable attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between 

 core sales  growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of core sales  growth provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to danaher’s peers management also uses core sales  growth to measure the company’s operating and financial performance the company excludes the effect of currency translation from core sales  because currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiturerelated items because the nature size timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from periodtoperiod and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult 

throughout this discussion references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of dbs

interest expense of 163 million  for 2017  was 22 million   lower  than in 2016  due primarily to the decrease in interest costs as a result of the early extinguishment of certain outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2016 using the proceeds from the fortive distribution and due to lower commercial paper borrowings in 2017  compared to 2016  partially offset by the cost of 

additional longterm debt refinancing relating to the acquisition of cepheid for a further description of the company’s debt as of december 31 2017  refer to note 9  to the consolidated financial statements interest expense of 184 million  in 2016  was 45 million   higher  than the 2015  interest expense of 140 million  due primarily to the higher interest costs associated with the debt issued in the second half of 2015 in connection with the 2015 acquisition of pall partially offset by decreases in interest costs as a result of the early extinguishment of the redeemed notes in the third quarter of 2016 using the proceeds from the fortive distribution 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations including the tcja and legislative policy changes that may result from the oecd’s initiative on base erosion and profit shifting for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states refer to “—liquidity and capital resources – cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

on december 22 2017 the tcja  was enacted substantially changing the us tax system and affecting the company in a number of ways notably the tcja   

 while the changes from the tcja are generally effective beginning in 2018 us gaap accounting for income taxes requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the tcja the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab no 118” allowed the company to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended december 31 2017 where reasonable estimates can be made the provisional accounting should be based on such estimates when no reasonable estimate can be made the provisional accounting may be based on the tax law in effect before the tcja the company is required to complete its tax accounting for the tcja within a one year period when it has obtained prepared and analyzed the information to complete the income tax accounting 

the company has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tcja however as described below the company has made reasonable estimates of the effects of the tcja on its consolidated financial statements which are included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations   

 the company will continue to analyze the effects of the tcja on its consolidated financial statements and operations additional impacts from the enactment of the tcja will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period as provided for in sab no 118 which extends up to one year from the enactment date   

yearoveryear changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was 160  175  and 144  respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate for each of 2017  2016  and 2015  differs from the us federal statutory rate of 350  due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate in addition   

 the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions the countries in which the company has a material presence that have had significantly lower statutory tax rates than the united states include china denmark germany singapore switzerland and the united kingdom the company’s ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the united states depends on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries and the amount of foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested in those 

countries the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company’s taxable income   

the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the irs  has completed substantially all of the examinations of the company’s federal income tax returns through 2011 and is currently examining certain of the company’s federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2015 in addition the company has subsidiaries in austria belgium canada china denmark finland france germany hong kong india italy japan new zealand sweden switzerland the united kingdom and various other countries states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2015   

tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries on december 10 2013 the company received assessments from the danish tax authority “skat” totaling approximately   dkk 15 billion  approximately 245 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2017   including interest through december 31 2017 imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company’s subsidiaries for the years 20042009 the company is currently in discussions with skat and anticipates receiving an assessment for years 20102012 totaling approximately dkk 895 million  approximately 144 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2017  including interest through december 31 2017    management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions the company appealed these assessments with the national tax tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the european court of justice should this appeal be unsuccessful the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its effective tax rate   

after considering the effect of the tcja the company expects its 2018 effective tax rate to be in the range of 20 to 21  any future legislative changes in the united states including regulations related to the tcja or potential tax reform in other jurisdictions could cause the company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate refer to note 12  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to income taxes 

discontinued operations 

as further discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements discontinued operations includes the results of the fortive businesses which were disposed of during the third quarter of 2016 as well as the results of the company’s former communications business which was disposed of during the third quarter of 2015 all periods presented have been restated to reflect the fortive and communications businesses within discontinued operations 

in 2017 danaher recorded a 22 million  income tax benefit related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain danaher tax returns which were jointly filed with fortive entities these reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns all fortive entityrelated balances were included in the income tax benefit related to discontinued operations    

in 2016 earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes  were 400 million  and reflected the operating results of the fortive businesses prior to the separation in 2015 earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes  were approximately 16 billion  and reflected the operations of both the fortive and communications businesses as well as the gain on the sale of the communications business in 2015 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income increased  by approximately 17 billion  in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily due to increased earnings from continuing operations an increased gain from foreign currency translation adjustments compared to 2016  pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments and the decrease in the unrealized gains losses on availableforsale securities from the sale of certain marketable equity securities partially offset by lower net earnings attributable to discontinued operations in 2017  compared to 2016  the company recorded a foreign currency translation gain  of 976 million  for 2017  compared to a translation loss  of 517 million  for 2016  the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain  of 71 million  for 2017  compared to a loss  of 58 million  for 2016  

comprehensive income decreased  by 617 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  primarily due to the impact of decreases in net earnings attributable to discontinued operations foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar compared to most major currencies during the year but at a lower rate than in the prior year and pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss  of 517 million  for 2016   

compared to a translation loss  of 976 million  for 2015  the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss  of 58 million  in 2016  compared to a gain  of 81 million  in 2015  

inflation 

the effect of inflation on the company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31 2017  2016  or 2015  

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk each of which could impact its consolidated financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2017  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock by 470 million 

as of december 31 2017  the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurobased commercial paper borrowings refer to note 9  to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2017  as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature the company may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2017  the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately 6 basis points a hypothetical increase of this average to 18 basis points would have increased the company’s annual interest expense by 4 million the hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the company’s commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2017  

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into us dollars danaher’s functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders’ equity 

currency exchange rates positively  impacted 2017  reported sales by 05  on a yearoveryear basis as the us dollar weakened against the euro partially offset by the effect of the us dollar strengthening against the japanese yen and chinese renminbi if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2017  were to prevail throughout 2018  currency exchange rates would positively impact 2018  estimated sales by approximately 20 relative to the company’s performance in 2017  strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the company’s consolidated financial statements in 

addition the company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies the company’s foreign currencydenominated debt partially hedges its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2017  would have reduced foreign currencydenominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by 880 million 

equity price risk 

the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio has in the past included publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price however during 2017 the company sold substantially all of its availableforsale equity securities 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and such transactions are generally insignificant to the company’s financial condition and results of operations these transactions are typically entered into with highquality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited 

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing requirements the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses consummating strategic acquisitions paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis

 operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 31 billion  for 2016  an increase  of 255 million  or 9  as compared to 2015  this increase  was primarily attributable to the increase  in net earnings from continuing operations in 2016  as compared to 2015

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products or services or claims alleging that company products or services infringe thirdparty intellectual property the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from periodtoperiod for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

acquired intangibles —the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess rd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur refer to notes 1 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing its goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a marketbased approach in evaluating the estimates derived by the marketbased approach management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

as of december 31 2017  the company had eight  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing   reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2017  indicated that in all instances the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 50 to approximately 600 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 35 to approximately 530 

the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company’s consolidated financial statements historically the company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct 

contingent liabilities —as discussed in “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 16  to the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

revenue recognition —the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies 

although most of the company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that in some instances may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where thirdparty evidence of pricing is not observable the company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or salestype leases certain of the company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 

on january 1 2018 the company adopted  accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance   refer to ‘new accounting standards’ in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company’s adoption of this asu 

if the company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect historically the company’s estimates of revenue have been materially correct 

pension and other postretirement benefits —for a description of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices refer to notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors the company’s consolidated financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 146 million 111 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 142 million 107 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017  a 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the us net obligation by 134 million 102 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 137 million 104 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017  

for 2017  the estimated longterm rate of return for the us plans is 70  and the company intends to continue to use an assumption of 70  for 2018  the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a planbyplan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 10  to 58  if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2017  was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2017  would have increased 9 million 6 million on an aftertax basis and 5 million 4 million on an aftertax basis respectively 

for a discussion of the company’s 2017  and anticipated 2018  defined benefit pension plan contributions refer to “—liquidity and capital resources – cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes —for a description of the company’s income tax accounting policies refer to notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 

3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when based upon the technical merits it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when 1 a tax audit is completed 2 applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or 3 the applicable statute of limitations expires 

on december 22 2017 the tcja  was enacted which substantially changes the us tax system including lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 and affected the company in a number of ways   under us gaap the company is required to account for tax legislation when the legislation is enacted accordingly the company has reflected the provisional estimate of changes from the tcja in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017  based upon the company’s analysis of the legislation using available information certain assumptions related to the impact of the tcja will require continued monitoring and further analysis including the amount of foreign cash and undistributed earnings subject to the transition tax the amount of available credits to reduce required payments of the transition tax and the impact of estimated temporary differences between book and taxable income in 2017 or prior periods under audit by the irs although the company believes that its estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ materially from these estimates the company will continue to refine these estimates throughout 2018 and record any required adjustments as they are determined as permitted by sab no 118 the us treasury department and the irs have not yet issued regulations implementing the new tax law and these regulations could result in changes to the company’s estimates some or all of these judgments are also subject to review by the irs if the irs were to successfully challenge the company’s right to realize some or all of the tax benefit the company has recorded based on current interpretation of the law regarding certain items or if the amount of the transition tax or other tax liabilities are understated it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial statements 

in addition certain of the company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark refer to “—results of operations – income taxes” and note 12  to the consolidated financial statements management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements including its effective tax rate 

an increase of 10 in the company’s 2017  nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2017  of 29 million

the following discussion includes information common to all of danaher’s segments 

materials 

the company’s manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including metallicbased components electronic components chemicals plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas also affect the company’s costs for freight and utilities the company purchases raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components the company utilizes a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to its supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2016  the company had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on the business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for the company’s operations refer to “item 1a risk factors”

competition 

although the company’s businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets the company’s competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of its competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as the company does because of the range of the products and services the company sells and the variety of markets it serves the company encounters a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than it is in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities the company is facing increased competition in a number of its served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line management believes that the company has a market leadership position in many of the markets it serves key competitive factors vary among the company’s businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality delivery speed service and support innovation distribution network breadth of product service and 

software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact the company’s business and financial results and certain of its businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and endmarkets that they serve for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth quarter however as a whole the company is not subject to material seasonality

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions economic conditions geopolitical events changes in laws regulations or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment or underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes or anticipation of potential changes in government fiscal tax trade and monetary policies changes in capital requirements for financial institutions government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors refer to “item 1 business—competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets in addition significant shifts in industry market share can occur in connection with product problems safety alerts and publications about products reflecting the competitive significance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in our industry our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the us fda by other federal and state governmental agencies by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials and drugsof abuse or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance such as 510k clearance or approvals for 

our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained even after initial regulatory clearance or approval if safety issues arise we may be required to amend conditions for use of a product such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use which could reduce the product’s market acceptance failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of these regulations real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products injunctions administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product suspension or withdrawal of approvals and premarket notification rescissions we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information including the federal regulations described in “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business including our reputation” compliance with regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs which could adversely affect our financial statements 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs including the following 

 these changes as well as other impacts from market demand government regulations thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to 

consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our acquisition of businesses including our recent acquisitions of pall and cepheid joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course and we also from time to time complete more material transactions refer to “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details acquisitions joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements 

 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the 

liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest spinoff splitoff or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the company’s earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

we could incur significant liability if the 2016 spinoff of fortive or the 2015 splitoff of our communications business is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of each of fortive in 2016 and our communications business in 2015 qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code these opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the internal revenue service “irs” could determine on audit that either or both separations are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion if either transaction is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2016 spinoff of fortive and the 2015 splitoff of our communications business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with fortive to govern the separation and the relationship between the two companies going forward we entered into similar agreements with netscout systems inc in connection with the splitoff of our communications business these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us if we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between danaher and such other parties and require danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities in addition some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that may house personal data these systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in addition security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure 

of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like most multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems  and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements  and prevent data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions  as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states  hipaa privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe and the new eu general data protection regulation will impose significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data several countries such as china and russia have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and impose endoflife disposal and takeback programs we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2016  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business including our reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety health care medical device anticorruption data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this annual report our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 



may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements for additional information regarding these risks refer to “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2016  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 356 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency 

and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions refer to the mda for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors may be substantially different from periodtoperiod in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities such as the audits described in the mda and the company’s financial statements due to the potential for changes to tax laws or changes to the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax assets or liabilities may differ from actual payments assessments or receipts if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate in addition any significant change to the tax system in the united states or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below could adversely affect our financial statements 

changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position 

recent legislative proposals seek to limit the ability of foreignowned corporations to deduct interest expense tax the accumulated unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of us corporations impose a minimum tax on the future offshore earnings of us multinational groups and make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations additionally the us congress government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for addressing base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the united states and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses the types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2016  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if thirdparties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain 

however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that thirdparties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statements 

thirdparties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

the united states government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a thirdparty if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property 

certain technology licensed by us under agreements with thirdparty licensors may be subject to government rights government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a governmentfunded program may include a nonexclusive royaltyfree worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the united states government has the right to require us or our licensors as applicable to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a thirdparty if they determine that 1 adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use 2 such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or 3 such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations further the government rights include the right to use and disclose without limitation technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services including software could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to “off label” use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from thirdparties can lead to personal injury death property damage or other liability these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants government agencies and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our reputation business and financial statements could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the fda regarding the manufacture of certain of our products an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs liability and lost revenue as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 123 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition as of december 31 2016  we had the ability to incur approximately an additional 11 billion  of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the com pany’s 70 billion  of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances  our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisitions and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase 

our current revolving credit facilities and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us for more information refer to the mda if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements in addition any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our business and financial statements   the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development supply and marketing of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies relying on collaborative relationships is risky because among other things our collaborative partners 1 may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations 2 may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner 3 may be acquired by other companies and decide to terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent 4 may compete with us 5 may not agree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship 6 may not have sufficient capital resources and 7 may not agree to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business—materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from thirdparties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance regulatory requirements cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change in any of these regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof could reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from periodtoperiod 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business including our productivity and reputation 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2016  approximately 62  of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in the highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and business including our growth rate 

the results of the eu membership referendum in the united kingdom could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements 

the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on eu membership   advising for the exit of the united kingdom from the eu has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan 

assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements

overview 

general 

refer to “item 1 business—general” for a discussion of danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations during 2016  approximately 62  of danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a diversified global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of its products and services help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results given the broad range of products manufactured services provided and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of the company’s geographic and industry diversity the company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges including rapid technological development particularly with respect to computing mobile connectivity communications and digitization in most of the company’s served markets the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force consolidation of the company’s competitors and increasing regulation the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and the company’s longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in highgrowth geographies and highgrowth market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins expand and improve the effectiveness of the company’s sales force continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment the company is making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources particularly in highgrowth markets in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations 

business performance 

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2016   increased   170  as compared to 2015  while differences exist among the company’s businesses on an overall basis demand for the company’s products and services increased at a similar rate in 2016  as compared to 2015  this demand together with the company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other businessspecific factors discussed below contributed to yearoveryear sales growth from existing businesses of 30  for the definition of “sales from existing businesses” refer to “—results of operations” below geographically both highgrowth and developed markets contributed to yearoveryear sales growth from existing businesses during 2016  sales growth rates from existing businesses in highgrowth markets grew at a highsingle digit rate in 2016  as compared to 2015  led by strength in china india and latin america partially offset by weakness in eastern europe highgrowth markets represented approximately 29 of the company’s total sales in 2016  sales from existing businesses in developed markets grew at a lowsingle digit rate in 2016  as compared to 2015  and were driven by north america and western europe 

the acquisitions of pall and cepheid as further discussed below provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company’s life sciences and diagnostics segments respectively by expanding each segment’s geographic and product line diversity including new and complementary product and service offerings in the area of life sciences filtration separation and purification technologies in the case of pall and molecular diagnostics in the case of cepheid and through the potential future acquisition of complementary businesses as pall and cepheid are integrated into the company the company also expects to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the danaher business system and the combined purchasing power of the company pall and cepheid 

fortive separation 

on july 2 2016 danaher completed the separation of its former test  measurement segment industrial technologies segment excluding the product identification businesses and retailcommercial petroleum business by distributing to danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fortive  the entity danaher incorporated to hold such businesses to effect the separation danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of fortive common stock for every two shares of danaher common stock outstanding as of june 15 2016 the record date for the distribution 

during the second quarter of 2016 the company received net cash distributions of approximately 30 billion  from fortive as consideration for the company’s contribution of assets to fortive in connection with the separation “fortive distribution”  danaher used a portion of the cash distribution proceeds to repay the 500 million   aggregate principal amount of 23  senior unsecured notes that matured in june 2016 and to redeem approximately 19 billion  in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in august 2016 consisting of the  company’s 5625  senior unsecured notes due 2018 54  senior unsecured notes due 2019 and 39  senior unsecured notes due 2021  collectively the “redeemed notes”  danaher also paid an aggregate of 188 million  in makewhole premiums in connection with the august 2016 redemptions plus accrued and unpaid interest   the company has also used and intends to use the balance of the fortive distribution to fund certain of the company’s regular quarterly cash dividends to shareholders 

the accounting requirements for reporting the separation of fortive as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed accordingly the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation the company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense and income to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business’ net assets to the company’s consolidated net assets   fortive had revenues of approximately 30 billion  in 2016 prior to the separation and approximately 61 billion  in 2015   

as a result of the separation the company incurred 48 million  in separationrelated costs during the year ended   december 31 2016  which are included in earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings these separation costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and separation activities within finance tax legal and information system functions as well as certain investment banking fees and tax liabilities incurred upon the separation   

acquisitions 

on november 4 2016  copper merger sub inc a california corporation and an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of cepheid a california corporation for 5300  per share in cash for a total purchase price of approximately 40 billion including assumed debt and net of acquired cash the “cepheid acquisition”  cepheid is a leading global molecular diagnostics company that develops manufactures and markets accurate and easy to use molecular systems and tests and is now part of the company’s diagnostics segment cepheid generated revenues of 539 million  in 2015    the company financed the cepheid acquisition price with available cash and proceeds from the issuance of us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper

results of operations 

in this report references to sales from existing businesses refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 1 sales from acquired businesses and 2 the impact of currency translation references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit as applicable attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses and b the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in danaher’s business and facilitating easier comparisons of danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to danaher’s peers the company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from periodtoperiod and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult throughout this discussion references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the application of the danaher business system

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a lowsingle digit rate during 2016  as compared with 2015  yearoveryear sales in the analytical instrumentation product line grew as increases in sales to the us municipal endmarket and western europe were partially offset by lower demand in eastern europe and china yearoveryear sales growth in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line was due primarily to an expansion of the customer base in the united states chemical treatment solutions saw an improvement in commodity oriented endmarkets in latin america in the fourth quarter of 2016 after declining growth in the earlier portion of 2016 sales in the business’ ultraviolet water disinfection product line grew on a yearoveryear basis due primarily to higher demand in municipal and industrial endmarkets in western europe china and australia

cost of sales and gross profit 



the yearoveryear increase  in cost of sales during 2016  as compared with 2015  is due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes including sales from recently acquired businesses this increase in cost of sales was partially offset by yearoveryear cost savings at recently acquired businesses particularly pall incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring and continued productivity improvement actions taken in 2016  and 2015  and the yearoveryear decrease in acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory which decreased cost of sales by 85 million during 2016 as compared to 2015 

the yearoveryear increase in cost of sales during 2015  as compared with 2014  is due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses and 2015 acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of pall and nobel biocare during the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014 respectively which increased cost of sales by 106 million during 2015 these factors were partially offset by lower yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2015  and 2014  

the yearoveryear increase  i n gross profit margins during 2016  as compared with 2015  is due primarily to the favorable impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2016  and 2015  and improved gross profit margins on a yearoveryear basis at recently acquired businesses particularly pall in addition the acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue were higher in 2015 than 2016 which improved gross profit margins by 50 basis points during 2016  as compared with 2015  

the yearoveryear increase  i n gross profit margins during 2015  as compared with 2014  is due primarily to the favorable impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes higher gross profit margins of recently acquired businesses and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2015  and 2014  these positive factors more than offset the increase in acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of pall and nobel biocare during the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014 respectively which adversely impacted gross profit margins comparisons by 80 basis points during 2015 as compared with 2014 

operating expenses 



the increase  in sga expenses as a percentage of sales from 2015  to 2016  was driven by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and higher relative spending levels at recently acquired businesses change in control payments and restructuring costs in connection with the acquisition of cepheid as well as associated transaction costs also increased sga expenses as a percentage of sales by 35 basis points during 2016  these increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2016 sales lower yearoveryear costs associated continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2016  and 2015  as well as the benefit of lower pall acquisition charges in 2016 compared to 2015 as described below 

sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased 150  basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2015  compared with 2014  the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales from 2014  to 2015  was driven by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and higher relative spending levels at recently acquired businesses change in control payments to pall employees in connection with the acquisition of pall as well as associated transaction costs and amortization charges associated with acquisitionrelated intangible assets net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits adversely impacted sga expenses as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points during 2015  these increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2015 sales lower yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2015  and 2014  

rd expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales declined  in 2016  as compared with 2015  due primarily to lower rd expenses as a percentage of sales in the businesses most recently acquired particularly pall as well as yearoveryear differences in the timing of investments in the company’s new product development initiatives rd expenses as a percentage of sales were flat in 2015  as compared to 2014  

nonoperating income expense 

in the third quarter of 2016 the company paid 188 million  of makewhole premiums associated with the early extinguishment of the redeemed notes the company recorded a loss on extinguishment of these borrowings net of certain deferred gains of 179 million   112 million  aftertax or 016  per diluted share 

the company received 265 million  of cash proceeds from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during the first quarter of 2016 the company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of 223 million   140 million  aftertax or 020  per diluted share

interest costs 

interest expense of 184 million  for 2016  was 45 million   higher  than in 2015  due primarily to the higher interest costs associated with the debt issued in the second half of 2015 in connection with the 2015 acquisition of pall partially offset by decreases in interest costs as a result of the early extinguishment of the redeemed notes in the third quarter of 2016 using the proceeds from the fortive distribution for a further description of the company’s debt as of december 31 2016  refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements interest expense of 140 million  in 2015  was 45 million  higher than the 2014  interest expense of 95 million  due primarily to the higher interest costs associated with the debt issued in the second half of 2015 in connection with the acquisition of pall 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and 

examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws including legislative policy changes that may result from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s initiative on base erosion and profit shifting and potential tax reform in the united states for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states refer to “—liquidity and capital resources – cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

yearoveryear changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  was 175  144  and 215  respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate for each of 2016  2015  and 2014  differs from the us federal statutory rate of 350 due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate 

 the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the united states federal state and foreign jurisdictions the countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower statutory tax rates than the united states include china denmark germany singapore switzerland and the united kingdom the company’s ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the united states depends on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries and the amount of foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested in those countries the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company’s taxable income   

the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the irs  has completed substantially all of the examinations of the company’s federal income tax returns through 2010 and is currently examining certain of the company’s federal income tax returns for 2011 through 2013 in addition the company has subsidiaries in austria belgium canada china denmark finland france germany hong kong india italy japan singapore sweden switzerland the united kingdom and various other countries states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2015   

tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries on december 10 2013 the company received assessments from the danish tax authority “skat” totaling approximately   dkk 14 billion  approximately 195 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2016   including interest through december 31 2016 imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company’s subsidiaries for the years 20042009 the company is currently in discussions with skat and anticipates receiving an assessment for years 20102012 totaling approximately dkk 814 million  approximately 115 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2016    management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions the company appealed these assessments with the national tax tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the european court of justice should this appeal 

be unsuccessful the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its effective tax rate   

as previously disclosed german tax authorities had raised issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2014 the company entered into a settlement agreement with the german tax authorities to resolve these open matters through 2014 the company recorded €49 million  approximately 60 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2014 of expense for taxes and interest related to this settlement during the fourth quarter of 2014   

the company’s effective tax rate for 2017  is expected to be approximately 21 any future legislative changes or potential tax reform in the united states or other jurisdictions could cause the company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate this expected rate reflects the anticipated discrete income tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to the company’s stock compensation programs which will be reflected as a reduction in tax expense beginning in 2017 refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this change in accounting guidance 

discontinued operations 

as further discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements discontinued operations includes the results of the fortive businesses which were disposed of during the third quarter 2016 as well as the results of the company’s former communications business which was disposed of during the third quarter of 2015 all periods presented have been restated to reflect the fortive and communications businesses within discontinued operations 

in 2016 earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes  were 400 million  and reflected the operating results of the fortive businesses prior to the separation in 2015 and 2014 earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes  were approximately 16 billion  and 960 million  respectively and reflected the operations of both the fortive and communications businesses as well as the gain on the sale of the communications business in 2015 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income decreased  by 617 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  primarily due to the impact of decreases in net earnings attributable to discontinued operations foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar compared to most major currencies during the year but at a lower rate than in the prior year and pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of 517 million  for 2016  compared to a translation loss of 976 million  for 2015  the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of 58 million  for 2016  compared to a gain of 81 million  for 2015  

comprehensive income increased by approximately 15 billion  in 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily due to the impact of increases in net earnings including those attributable to discontinued operations foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar compared to most major currencies during the year but at a lower rate than in the prior year and pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of 976 million  for 2015  compared to a translation loss of approximately 12 billion  for 2014  pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments resulted in a gain of 81 million  in 2015  compared to a loss of 361 million  in 2014  

inflation 

the effect of inflation on the company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31 2016  2015  or 2014  

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk each of which could impact its financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall 

and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2016  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock by approximately 335 million 

as of december 31 2016  the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurobased commercial paper borrowings refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2016  as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature the company anticipates issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2016  the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately 10 basis points a hypothetical increase of this average to 20 basis points would have increased the company’s annual interest expense by 7 million 

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into us dollars danaher’s functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2016  would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 16 billion 

currency exchange rates negatively  impacted 2016  reported sales by 10  on a yearoveryear basis as the us dollar was on average stronger against most major currencies during 2016  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2015  if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2016  were to prevail throughout 2017  currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2017  estimated sales by approximately 25 relative to the company’s performance in 2016  additional strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk although the company’s foreign currencydenominated debt partially hedges its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities a 10 decline in the value of these equity securities as of december 31 2016  would have reduced the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio by 17 million 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer “item 1a risk factors” 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and such transactions are generally insignificant to the company’s financial condition and results of operations these transactions are typically entered into with highquality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited 

liquidity and capital resources

while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws most of the company’s foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits for most of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the company has recorded a deferred tax liability for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the united states no provisions for us income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states and the amount of us income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ if it repatriated these earnings the cash that the company’s foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions as of december 31 2016  the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely and the basis difference in investments outside of the united states for which deferred taxes have not been provided in aggregate was approximately 230 billion  as of december 31 2016  management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  under 1 debt obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on the company’s balance sheet under gaap the amounts presented in the “other longterm liabilities” line in the table below include 940 million  of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and do not include 172 million  of current gross unrecognized tax benefits which are included in the “accrued expenses and other liabilities” line on the consolidated balance sheet however the timing of the longterm portion of these liabilities is uncertain and therefore they have been included in the “more than 5 years” column in the table below refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits certain of the company’s acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain refer to “—offbalance sheet arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below 



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of guarantees of the company as of december 31 2016  



guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers insurance providers 

financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company’s obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters in particular in connection with the 2016 fortive separation and the 2015 splitoff of the company’s communications business danaher entered into separation and distribution and related agreements pursuant to which danaher agreed to indemnify the other parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future these indemnification obligations cover a variety of liabilities including but not limited to employee tax and environmental matters the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company’s financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to thirdparties in the event any of these thirdparties vacate any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial statements 

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products or services or claims alleging that company products or services infringe thirdparty intellectual property the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from periodtoperiod for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

acquired intangibles —the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess research and development and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur refer to notes 1 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing its goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a marketbased approach the company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the marketbased approach management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

as of december 31 2016  the company had eight  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing   reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth as of the date of the 2016  annual impairment test the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranged from 503 million  to approximately 117 billion  the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2016  indicated that in all instances the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 70 to approximately 380 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 50 to approximately 330 

the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

contingent liabilities —as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

revenue recognition —the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies 

although most of the company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that in some instances may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where thirdparty evidence of pricing is not observable the company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements the company also enters into lease 

arrangements with customers which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or salestype leases certain of the company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 

if the company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected 

pension and other postretirement benefits —for a description of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices refer to notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors the company’s financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 141 million 88 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 140 million 102 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016  a 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the us net obligation by 131 million 82 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 140 million 102 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016  

for 2016  the estimated longterm rate of return for the us plans are 70  and the company intends to continue to use an assumption of 70  for 2017  this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan targets to invest between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds the company’s nonus plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 11  to 58  if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2016  was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2016  would have increased 9 million 6 million on an aftertax basis and 5 million 4 million on an aftertax basis respectively 

for a discussion of the company’s 2016  and anticipated 2017  defined benefit pension plan contributions refer to “—liquidity and capital resources – cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes —for a description of the company’s income tax accounting policies refer to notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company’s financial statements 

the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when based upon the technical merits it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when 1 a tax audit is completed 2 applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or 3 the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of the company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark refer to “—results of operations – income taxes” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its effective tax rate 

an increase in the company’s nominal tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2016  of 26 million

we are pursuing a plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies the proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

we have announced a plan to separate into two independent public companies in the third quarter of 2016 through a spinoff of certain of our businesses unanticipated developments including possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings regulatory approvals or clearances and trade qualifications uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable andor different than expected even if the transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spinoff expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business following the proposed separation the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment or underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies changes in capital requirements for financial institutions government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 

 although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy dont benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see “item 1 business  competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for 

acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our acquisition of businesses including our recent acquisition of pall joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details in particular as of the date of this report the acquisition of pall in 2015 is danaher’s largest acquisition and has expanded danaher’s business into new markets acquisitions joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 

 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest spinoff splitoff or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the companys earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the us fda by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals such as 510k clearance for our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained failure to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of these regulations real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products injunctions administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product suspension or withdrawal of approvals and premarket notification rescissions we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information including the federal regulations described in “item 1 business  regulatory matters” many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to and in some cases more stringent than such federal regulations for more information regarding regulations we are subject to please see “item 1 business  regulatory matters” 

failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation” compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs which could adversely affect our financial statements 

the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs including the following 

 

 these changes as well as other impacts from market demand government regulations third party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2015 will have a material effect on our financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety health care medical device anticorruption and other regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following

these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business  regulatory matters” 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2015 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 363 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions please see the mda for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities such as the audits described in the mda and the companys financial statements due to the potential for changes to tax laws or changes to the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate in addition any significant change to the tax system in the us or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2015 will have a material effect on our financial statements 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products including software or services could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or bugs in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from third parties can lead to personal injury death property damage or other liability these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our reputation business and financial statements could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 129 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to incur approximately an additional 20 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under our 60 billion of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2015 our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisitions and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase 

our current revolving credit facilities and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us for more information please refer to the mda if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements in addition any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements   the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business  materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our 

business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change in any of these regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof could reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity results of operations and reputation 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2015 approximately 56  of our sales were derived from customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the us since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in the highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities these systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in addition security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like many multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production 

and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements

general 

please see “item 1 business – general” for a discussion of danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations during 2015  approximately 56  of danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a diversified global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of its products and services typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results given the broad range of products manufactured software and services provided and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of the company’s geographic and industry diversity the company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges including rapid technological development particularly with respect to computing mobile connectivity communications and digitization in most of the company’s served markets the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force consolidation of the company’s competitors and increasing regulation the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and the company’s longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in highgrowth geographies and highgrowth market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products services and software with higher gross profit margins expand and improve the effectiveness of the company’s sales force continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment the company is making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources particularly in highgrowth markets in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations 

business performance and outlook 

while differences exist among the company’s businesses on an overall basis demand for the company’s products software and services increased in 2015  as compared to 2014  resulting in aggregate yearoveryear sales growth from existing businesses of 30 the company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other businessspecific factors discussed below also contributed to yearoveryear sales growth geographically both highgrowth and developed markets contributed to yearoveryear sales growth from existing businesses during 2015  sales growth rates from existing businesses in highgrowth markets grew at a midsingle digit rate in 2015  as compared to 2014  led by strength in china and india partially offset by weakness in russia and latin america highgrowth markets represented approximately 27 of the company’s total sales in 2015  sales from existing businesses in developed markets grew at a lowsingle digit rate in 2015  as compared to 2014  and were driven by north america and western europe while individual business results will vary the company expects sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a yearoveryear basis during 2016  at a level in line with the growth levels experienced in 2015  but remains cautious about challenges due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties including global uncertainties related to monetary and fiscal policies 

the acquisition of pall as further discussed below provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company’s life sciences and diagnostics segment by expanding the segment’s geographic and product line diversity 

including new and complementary product and service offerings in the area of filtration separation and purification technologies and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses as pall is integrated into the company the company also expects to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the danaher business system and the combined purchasing power of the company and pall

results of operations 

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2015  increased 75  compared to 2014  sales from existing businesses contributed 30  growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 105  growth on a yearoveryear basis the impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 60  as the us dollar was on average stronger against other major currencies during 2015  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2014  

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2014  increased 50  compared to 2013  sales from existing businesses contributed 40  growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 15  growth on a yearoveryear basis the impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 05  as the us dollar was on average stronger against other major currencies during 2014  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2013

price increases in the segment contributed 10 to sales growth on a yearoveryear basis during 2014  as compared with 2013 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013 continued increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables as well as packaging and color solutions was partially offset by continued lower yearoveryear demand in consumer electronicsrelated equipment geographically yearoveryear sales growth was led by north america and europe 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s automation business grew at a lowsingle digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013 improved yearoveryear demand in industrial automation in north america distribution and in medical related endmarkets was partially offset by lower yearoveryear demand in technology agricultural and defenserelated endmarkets and the effect of exiting certain lowmargin original equipment manufacturer product lines which negatively impacted the first half of 2014 geographically strong yearoveryear demand in china and other highgrowth markets as well as moderate sales growth in north america more than offset yearoveryear sales declines in europe 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses collectively grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to strong demand in the segment’s engine retarder business and to a lesser extent continued improving demand in the segment’s sensors and controls businesses 

operating profit margins increased 160 basis points during 2014 as compared to 2013 yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by 

 

cost of sales and gross profit 



the yearoveryear increase in cost of sales during 2015  as compared with 2014  is due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses and 2015 acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of pall and nobel biocare during the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014 respectively which increased cost of sales by 111 million during 2015 these factors were partially offset by lower yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2014 and 2015 

the yearoveryear increase in cost of sales during 2014  as compared with 2013  is due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of nobel biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives partially offset by incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014 

gross profit margins increased 70 basis points on a yearoveryear basis during 2015  as compared with 2014  due primarily to the favorable impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes higher gross profit margins of recently acquired businesses and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2014 and 2015 these positive factors more than offset the 2015 acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of pall and nobel biocare during the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014 respectively which adversely impacted gross profit margins comparisons by 30 basis points during 2015 as compared with 2014 

gross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a yearoveryear basis during 2014  as compared with 2013  due primarily to the favorable impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014 partially offset by acquisitionrelated charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of nobel biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives 

operating expenses 



selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 130  basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2015  compared with 2014  the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2014  to 2015  was driven by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and higher relative spending levels at recently acquired businesses in addition costs incurred in connection with the separation adversely impacted yearoveryear comparisons by 10 basis points change in control payments to pall employees in connection with the pall acquisition as well as associated transaction costs and amortization charges associated with acquisitionrelated intangible assets net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits adversely impacted selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 20 basis points during 2015  these increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the company’s 

general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2015 sales lower yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2014 and 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 10  basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2014  compared with 2013  the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2013  to 2014  reflects incremental yearoveryear investments in the company’s sales and marketing growth initiatives higher corporate expenses and incremental yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives in addition transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the nobel biocare acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2014 unfavorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison by approximately five basis points these increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2014  sales and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with 2013  and 2014  restructuring actions 

research and development expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales remained flat in 2015  as compared with 2014  and 2013

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws including legislative policy changes that may result from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s initiative on base erosion and profit shifting for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states refer to “—liquidity and capital resources – cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

yearoveryear changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  was 218  252  and 242  respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate for each of 2015  2014  and 2013  differs from the us federal statutory rate of 350 due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate the effective tax rate of 218  in 2015  includes net tax benefits from foreign exchange losses releases of valuation allowances related to foreign operating losses and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation partially offset by changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions and other matters the effective tax rate of 252  in 2014  includes tax expense for audit settlements in various jurisdictions partially offset by the release of valuation allowances and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation the effective tax rate of 242  in 2013  includes recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations partially offset by adjustments of reserve estimates related to prior period uncertain tax positions the matters referenced above have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and in the aggregate reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 140  and 20  basis points in 2015 and 2013 respectively and increased the provision for income taxes by approximately 170  basis points in 2014 

the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the united states federal state and foreign jurisdictions the countries in which the company has a significant presence that have significantly lower statutory tax rates than the united states include china denmark germany singapore switzerland and the united kingdom the company’s ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the united states is dependent on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries and the amount of foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested in those countries the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company’s taxable income 

the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the internal revenue service “irs” has completed examinations of certain of the company’s federal income tax returns through 2009 and is currently examining certain of the company’s federal income tax returns for 2010 through 2013 in addition the company has subsidiaries in belgium brazil canada china denmark finland france germany india italy japan singapore sweden the united kingdom and various other countries states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2003 through 2014 

tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries on december 10 2013 the company received assessments from the danish tax authority “skat” totaling approximately dkk 12 billion  approximately 180 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2015 including interest through december 31 2015 imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the 

company’s subsidiaries for the years 20042009 if the skat claims are successful it is likely that the company would be assessed additional amounts for years 20102012 totaling approximately dkk 700 million  approximately 102 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2015 management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend its positions the company appealed these assessments with the national tax tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the european court of justice should this appeal be unsuccessful the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its effective tax rate 

as previously disclosed german tax authorities had raised issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2014 the company entered into a settlement agreement with the german tax authorities to resolve these open matters through 2014 the company recorded €49 million  approximately 60 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2014 of expense for taxes and interest related to this settlement during the fourth quarter of 2014 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be approximately 23 to 24 this anticipated rate reflects the benefit from the research and experimentation credit in the united states which was permanently extended in 2015 

discontinued operations 

as further discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements discontinued operations includes the results of the company’s test  measurement segment’s communications business other than the data communications cable installation business and the communication service provider business of fluke networks which are now part of the instruments business of the company’s test  measurement segment which was disposed of during the third quarter of 2015 all periods presented have been restated to reflect the communications business within discontinued operations 

in 2015 earnings from operations of discontinued business net of tax were 759 million  and reflected the operating results of the communications business as well as the gain on the sale of the communications business in 2014 and 2013 earnings from operations of discontinued businesses net of tax were 55 million  and 104 million  respectively and reflected the operations of the communications business 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income increased by approximately 15 billion  in 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily due to the impact of increases in net earnings foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar compared to most major currencies during the year but at a lower rate than in the prior year and pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of approximately 10 billion  for 2015  compared to a translation loss of approximately 12 billion  for 2014  the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain of 81 million  for 2015  compared to a loss of 361 million  for 2014  

comprehensive income decreased by approximately 20 billion  in 2014  as compared to 2013  primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar compared to most major currencies during the year in addition to the impact from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of approximately 12 billion  for 2014  compared to a translation loss of 62 million  for 2013  pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments resulted in a loss of 361 million  in 2014  compared to a gain of 289 million  in 2013  

inflation 

the effect of inflation on the company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31 2015  2014  or 2013  

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices each of which could impact its financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2015  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock by approximately 445 million 

as of december 31 2015  the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurobased commercial paper borrowings refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2015  as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature the company anticipates issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2015  the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately 20 basis points a hypothetical increase of this average to 40 basis points would have increased the company’s interest expense by 7 million 

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into us dollars danaher’s functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2015  would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 14 billion 

currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2015  reported sales by 60  on a yearoveryear basis as the us dollar was on average stronger against most major currencies during 2015  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2014  if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2015  were to prevail throughout 2016  currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2016  estimated sales by approximately 15 relative to the company’s performance in 2015  additional strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

on april 2 2014 the company terminated the japanese yenus dollar currency swap agreement that had been acquired in connection with a prior business acquisition the currency swap agreement initially required the company to purchase approximately 184 million japanese yen jpy¥ at a rate of 1¥10225 on a monthly basis through june 1 2018 the currency swap did not qualify for hedge accounting and as a result changes in the fair value of the currency swap were reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings each reporting period the fair value of the currency swap as of the termination date was not significant and the fair value had not 

changed significantly during 2014 prior to the swap being terminated during the year ended december 31 2013 the company recorded pretax income of 14 million related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and with the exception of the yen swap noted above such transactions are generally insignificant to the company’s financial condition and results of operations these transactions are entered into only with highquality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited 

equity price risk 

the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities a 10 decline in the value of these equity securities as of december 31 2015  would have reduced the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio by 34 million 

commodity price risk

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses consummating strategic acquisitions paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis

 48 

investments product lines and discontinued operations are reflected in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows and therefore do not contribute to operating cash flows 

 operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 36 billion  for 2014  an increase of 151 million  or 4  as compared to 2013  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in operating profit in 2014  as compared to 2013

while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws most of the company’s foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits for most of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the company has recorded a deferred tax liability for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the united states no provisions for us income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states and the amount of us income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ if it repatriated these earnings the cash that the

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of offbalance sheet commitments of the company as of december 31 2015  



guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company’s obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company’s financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial statements 

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products or services or claims alleging that company products services or software infringe third party intellectual property the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

acquired intangibles —the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess research and development and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur refer to notes 1 2 and 6 in the company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing its goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a marketbased approach the company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the marketbased approach management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

as of december 31 2015  the company had 23  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from 7 million  to approximately 94 billion  the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2015  indicated that in all instances the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 0 to approximately 900 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 10 to approximately 800 after applying the hypothetical 10 decrease two reporting units’ hypothetical fair values were lower than their respective carrying values management evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of these reporting units including as applicable results of the estimate of fair value using an income approach the short period of time since the acquisition of these businesses market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance and concluded no impairment charge was required 

the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

contingent liabilities —as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements if the reserves established by 

the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

revenue recognition —the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services refer to note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies 

although most of the company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that in some instances may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable the company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or salestype leases certain of the company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 

if the company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the company’s revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected 

pension and other postretirement benefits —for a description of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices refer to notes 10 and 11 in the company’s consolidated financial statements calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors the company’s financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 147 million 92 million on an aftertax basis and the nonus net obligation by 157 million 118 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2015  

for 2015  the estimated longterm rate of return for the us plan is 75  and the company intends to use an assumption of 70  for 2016  due to this decrease in the estimated long term rate of return on assets there will be an increase in the expense of approximately 9 million  in 2016  this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan targets to invest between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds the company’s nonus plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 110  to 600  if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2015  was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2015  would have increased 9 million 6 million on an aftertax basis and 5 million 4 million on an aftertax basis respectively 

effective december 31 2015 the company changed its estimate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its us and nonus pension and other postretirement benefit plans previously the company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation the new estimate utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the new estimate provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates the change does not affect the measurement of the company’s us and nonus pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and it is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle which is applied prospectively for fiscal 2016 the change in estimate is expected to reduce us and nonus pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit plan cost by 25 million  when compared to the prior estimate 

for a discussion of the company’s 2015  and anticipated 2016  defined benefit pension plan contributions please see “—liquidity and capital resources – cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes —for a description of the company’s income tax accounting policies refer to notes 1 and 12 to the company’s consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company’s financial statements 

the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when based upon the technical merits it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when 1 a tax audit is completed 2 applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or 3 the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of the company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark see “—results of operations – income taxes” and note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company’s financial statements including its effective tax rate 

an increase in the company’s nominal tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended december 31 2015  of 33 million  

new accounting standards 

in december 2015 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201517 income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  “asu 201517” asu 201517 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented the company has chosen to early adopt this asu prospectively and therefore the 2015 consolidated balance sheet reflects the new disclosure requirements 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201516 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments topic 805  which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurementperiod adjustments retrospectively the new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurementperiod adjustment including the impact on prior periods be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements the asu requires disclosure of the nature and amount of measurementperiod adjustments as well as information with respect to the portion of the adjustments recorded in currentperiod earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustments to provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date the company has chosen to early adopt this asu and therefore disclosures included within these consolidated financial statements have been updated to reflect the new disclosure requirements 

in may 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201507 disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent  “asu 201507” asu 201507 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair values are estimated using the net asset value practical expedient provided by accounting standards codification 820 fair value measurement disclosures about investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share are limited under the new standard to those investments for which the plan has elected to estimate the fair value using the net asset value practical expedient the asu is effective for entities other than public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 with retrospective application to all periods presented with early adoption permitted the company has chosen to early adopt this asu and therefore disclosures included within these consolidated financial statements have been updated to reflect the new disclosure requirements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  this asu requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the asu is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 but the company has chosen to early adopt the standard and has applied the guidance to all 2015 debt issuances the company did not retrospectively apply this guidance to debt offerings prior to 2015 as the impact to the consolidated financial statements was not material 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which impacts virtually all aspects of an entity’s revenue recognition the core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services on july 9 2015 the fasb deferred the effective date of the standard by one year which results in the new standard being effective for the company at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2018 the company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures including possible transition alternatives

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration other austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy dont benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business   

in recent years we have implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet 

targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services   

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see “item 1 business  competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offerings may fail to reach 

the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our acquisition of businesses joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details these acquisitions joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 

 18 

deficiencies may increase our expenses adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations 

 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest spinoff splitoff or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the companys earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

we are pursuing a plan to distribute ownership of our communications business to danaher shareholders and merge the business into a subsidiary of netscout in a taxfree transaction the proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

danaher has announced plans to distribute ownership of its communications business to danaher shareholders in either a spinoff transaction a splitoff transaction or a combination splitoff and spinoff and merge the business into a subsidiary of netscout both the distribution and merger are expected to qualify as taxfree transactions to danaher and its shareholders except to the extent that cash is paid to danaher stockholders in lieu of fractional shares unanticipated developments including delays in obtaining or satisfying or failure to obtain or satisfy tax rulings regulatory approvals netscout shareholder approval and other conditions to closing and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes could delay or prevent the proposed transaction or cause the proposed transaction to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable andor different than expected on december 24 2014 netscout received a request for additional information “second request” from the us department of justice the effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the hart–scott–rodino antitrust improvements act until 30 days after both netscout and danaher have substantially complied with the request unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the us department of justice even if the transaction is completed some or all of the anticipated value and benefits therefrom may not be achieved expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed transaction may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate executing the proposed transaction also requires significant time and attention from management which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business following the proposed separation and merger the combined value of the common stock of danaher and the shares of common stock of netscout issued as consideration for our communications business may not be equal to or greater than what the value of danaher’s common stock would have been had the proposed transaction not occurred 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the us fda by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals such as 510k clearance for our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained failure to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of these regulations real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products injunctions administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product suspension or withdrawal of approvals and premarket notification rescissions we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse pricing and sales and marketing practices in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information including the federal regulations described in “item 1  business  regulatory matters” many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to and in some cases more stringent than such federal regulations for more information regarding regulations we are subject to please see “item 1  business  regulatory matters” 

failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation” compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses 

the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs which could adversely affect our financial statements 

the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs including the following 

 these changes as well as other impacts from market demand government regulations third party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2014 will have a material effect on our financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety healthcare medical device anticorruption and other regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage to our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often 

subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business  regulatory matters” 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2014 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 243 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar such as the strengthening that has taken place in recent periods increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions please see the mda for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities such as the audits described in the mda and the companys financial statements due to the potential for changes to tax laws or changes to the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate in addition any significant change to the tax system in the us or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot 

assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2014 will have a material effect on our financial statements 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products including software or services could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or bugs in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from third parties can lead to personal injury death property damage or other liability these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our reputation business and financial statements could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 35 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition based on the availability under our credit facilities as of december 31 2014 we had the ability to incur an additional 17 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisitions and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase 

our current revolving credit facility and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us for more information please refer to the mda if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements in addition any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements   the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business  materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers including freight carriers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change in any of these regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof could reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity results of operations and reputation 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2014 approximately 57 of our sales were derived from customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the us since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in the highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 25 

 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities these systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in addition security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like many multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements

sales from existing businesses in the segments other businesses collectively grew at a lowsingle digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012 strong yearoveryear demand in the segments energetic materials business was partially offset by lower yearoveryear demand in the segments engine retarder business sales from existing businesses in the segments sensors and controls businesses were essentially flat on a yearoveryear basis 

operating profit margins increased 40 basis points during 2013 as compared to 2012 the following factors impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons 

2013 vs 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by 

 42 

2013 vs 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by 

 cost of sales and gross profit 

  



cost of sales increased approximately 3 on a year over year basis during 2014  as compared to 2013  due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of nobel biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives partially offset by incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014 

cost of sales increased approximately 4 on a yearoveryear basis for 2013  as compared to 2012 due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes and the impact of the us excise tax on medical devices imposed in 2013 partially offset by the yearoveryear decline in costs associated with restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements in 2013 the us imposed a 23 excise tax on the sale or importation of certain medical devices which affected various products in the companys life sciences  diagnostics and dental segments the excise tax increased the companys 2013 cost of sales as a percentage of revenue on a yearoveryear basis by approximately 20 basis points the impact of the medical devices excise tax was partially mitigated by general price increases implemented during 2013 

gross profit margins increased 30 basis points on a yearoveryear basis during 2014  as compared to 2013  due primarily to the favorable impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014 partially offset by acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of nobel biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives 

gross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2013  as compared to 2012 due primarily to the favorable impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes and the yearoveryear decline in costs relating to restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements the excise tax noted above increased the companys 2013 cost of sales as a percentage of revenue on a yearoveryear basis by approximately 20 basis points the impact of the medical devices excise tax was partially mitigated by general price increases implemented during 2013 

operating expenses 

  



selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 20 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2014 compared to 2013 the yearoveryear increase reflects incremental yearoveryear investments in the companys sales and marketing growth initiatives higher corporate expenses and incremental yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives in addition transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the nobel biocare acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2014 unfavorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison 

by approximately five basis points these increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the companys general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2014 sales the effect of the 2013 impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with a communications business technology investment and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with 2013 and 2014 restructuring actions 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained flat from 2012 to 2013 the benefit of increased leverage of the companys cost base resulting from higher 2013 sales and the yearoveryear decline in restructuring costs was offset by incremental yearoveryear increases in investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives yearoveryear comparisons were also adversely impacted by an impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with a communications business technology investment which increased selling general and administrative expenses by 15 basis points in 2013 

research and development expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points on a yearoveryear basis in 2014 as compared to 2013 incremental yearoveryear increases in investments in the companys new product development initiatives were the primary contributors to this increase research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points on a yearoveryear basis in 2013 as compared to 2012 due primarily to new product development initiatives

interest costs 

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness refer to “—liquidity and capital resources – financing activities and indebtedness” below 

interest expense of 123 million  for 2014  was 23 million  lower than in 2013  due primarily to the repayment of the 400 million principal amount of 13 senior unsecured notes due 2014 the 2014 notes upon maturity in june 2014 in addition to the repayment of the €500 million principal amount of eurobond notes due 2013 the eurobond notes and the 300 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2013 the 2013 notes upon maturity in july and june 2013 respectively interest expense of 146 million  in 2013  was 12 million lower than the 2012  interest expense of 158 million  due primarily to the repayment of the eurobond notes and the 2013 notes 

interest income was 17 million  6 million  and 3 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increase in interest income in 2014 compared to prior periods reflects higher overall cash holdings throughout 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states refer to “—liquidity and capital resources – cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

yearoveryear changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  was 254  244  and 236  respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate for each of 2014  2013  and 2012  differs from the us federal statutory rate of 350 due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 also include the benefit from the reinstatement of certain tax benefits and credits resulting from the enactments of the tax increase prevention act of 2014 and the america tax relief act of 2012 in addition the effective tax rate of 254  in 2014 includes tax expense for audit settlements in various jurisdictions and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions partially offset by the release of valuation allowances and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitations the effective tax rates of 244  in 2013 and 236  in 2012 include recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations partially offset by adjustments of reserve estimates related to prior period uncertain tax positions the matters referenced above have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and in the aggregate increased the provision for income taxes by approximately 165  basis points in 2014  and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 20  basis points in 2013  and 30  basis points in 2012  

the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the united states federal state and foreign jurisdictions the countries in which the company has a significant presence that have significantly lower statutory tax rates than the united states include china denmark germany and the united kingdom the companys ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the united states is dependent on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the companys financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the companys taxable income 

the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the internal revenue service “irs” has completed examinations of certain of the companys federal income tax returns through 2009 and is currently examining certain of the companys federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2011 the companys us tax returns for 2012 and 2013 remain open for examination by the irs in addition the company has subsidiaries in belgium brazil canada china denmark france finland germany india italy japan norway singapore sweden the united kingdom and various other countries states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2002 through 2013 

tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the companys subsidiaries on december 10 2013 the company received assessments from the danish tax authority “skat” totaling approximately dkk 12 billion  approximately 190 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2014 including interest through december 31 2014 imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the companys subsidiaries for the years 20042009 if the skat claims are successful it is likely that the company would be assessed additional amounts for years 20102012 totaling approximately dkk 650 million  approximately 106 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2014 management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend its positions the company appealed these assessments with the national tax tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the european court of justice should this appeal be unsuccessful the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the companys financial statements including its effective tax rate 

as previously disclosed german tax authorities had raised issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the company’s subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2014 the company entered into a settlement agreement with the german tax authorities to resolve these open matters through 2014 the company recorded €49 million approximately 60 million based on exchange rates as of december 31 2014 of expense for taxes and interest related to this settlement during the fourth quarter of 2014 

the companys effective tax rate for 2015  is expected to be approximately 240 this anticipated rate reflects no benefit from the research and experimentation credit in the united states which expired at the end of 2014 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income decreased by 20 billion  for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar compared to most major currencies during the year in addition to pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of 12 billion  for 2014 compared to a translation loss of 62 million  for 2013 pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments resulted in a loss of 361 million in 2014 compared to a gain of 289 million in 2013 comprehensive income increased by 599 million  for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increased net earnings for 2013 and the impact of pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain of 289 million  for 2013 compared to a loss of 140 million  for 2012 

inflation 

the effect of inflation on the company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31 2014  2013  or 2012  

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices each of which could impact its financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2014  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock by approximately 90 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity 

as of december 31 2014  the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurobased commercial paper borrowings refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2014  as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature the company anticipates issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2014  a 10 increase in average market interest rates on the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 01 million a 10 hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2014  

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of our applicable subsidiary the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars danaher’s functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2014  would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 10 billion 

currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2014  reported sales by 10 on a yearoveryear basis as the us dollar was on average stronger against most major currencies during 2014  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2013  if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2014  were to prevail throughout 2015  currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2015  estimated sales by approximately 35 relative to the company’s performance in 2014  due to the continued strengthening of the us dollar against most major currencies at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 additional strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

on april 2 2014 the company terminated the japanese yenus dollar currency swap agreement that had been acquired in connection with a prior business acquisition the currency swap agreement initially required the company to purchase approximately 184 million  japanese yen jpy¥ at a rate of 1 ¥10225  on a monthly basis through june 1 2018 the currency swap did not qualify for hedge accounting and as a result changes in the fair value of the currency swap were reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings each reporting period the fair value of the currency swap as of the termination date was not significant and the fair value had not changed significantly during 2014 prior to the swap being terminated during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012 the company recorded pretax income of 14 million  and 22 million  respectively related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and with the exception of the yen swap noted above such transactions are generally insignificant to the companys financial condition and results of operations these transactions are entered into only with highquality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited 

equity price risk 

the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities a 10 decline in the value of these equity securities as of december 31 2014  would have reduced the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio by 26 million 

commodity price risk

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses consummating strategic acquisitions paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

following is an overview of the companys cash flows and liquidity for the years ended december 31 

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

  



 48 

 operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes restructuring activities pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were 38 billion  for 2014  an increase of 173 million  or 5  as compared to 2013  the yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from 2013  to 2014  was primarily attributable to the following factors 

 operating cash flows from continuing operations were 36 billion  for 2013  an increase of 83 million or 2 as compared to 2012  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in operating profit in 2013 as compared to 2012 

investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures including instruments leased to customers and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets 

net cash used in investing activities was 34 billion  during 2014  compared to 553 million  and 19 billion  of net cash used in 2013  and 2012  respectively 

acquisitions divestitures and sale of investments 

2014  acquisitions divestitures and sale of investments

financing activities and indebtedness 

cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper common stock and debt excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation payments of principal on indebtedness payments for repurchases of common stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders financing activities used cash of 218 million  during 2014  compared to 16 billion  of cash used during 2013  the yearoveryear decrease was due primarily to the incrementally lower yearoveryear repayment of borrowings with maturities longer than 90 days and incrementally higher yearoveryear net proceeds received from the issuance of commercial paper borrowings the company repaid the 2014 notes upon their maturity in june 2014 

total debt was 35 billion  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the company’s debt as of december 31 2014  was as follows 

 the 2011 financing notes the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes are collectively referred to as the “notes” 

commercial paper programs and credit facility 

the company satisfies any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flow and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under its us and euro commercial paper programs under these programs the company or a subsidiary of the company as applicable may issue and sell unsecured shortterm promissory notes interest expense on the notes is paid at maturity and is generally based on the ratings assigned to the company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to libor borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions during 2014  as commercial paper balances matured the company either paid such balances from available cash or refinanced such balances by issuing new commercial paper as of december 31 2014 the company had 450 million in us dollar denominated commercial paper outstanding and 315 million   €260 million  of commercial paper outstanding under the euro commercial paper program 

as of december 31 2014  borrowings outstanding under the company’s us and euro commercial paper programs had a weighted average annual interest rate of 013  and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately twelve  days commercial paper outstanding at any one time during the year had balances ranging from 450 million to 822 million carried interest at annual rates ranging between 004  and 02  and had original maturities between seven  and thirtyfour  days the company has classified its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2014  as longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet as the company had the intent and ability as supported by availability under the credit facility referenced below to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date 

credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by a 25 billion unsecured multiyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on july 15 2016 the “credit facility” the credit facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes under the credit facility borrowings other than bid loans bear interest at a rate equal to at the company’s option either 1 a liborbased rate plus a margin that varies according to the company’s longterm debt credit rating the “eurodollar rate” or 2 the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 12 of 1 b the prime rate and c the eurodollar rate plus 1 plus in each case a margin that varies according to the company’s longterm debt credit rating in addition to certain initial fees the company paid at inception of the credit facility the company is obligated to pay an annual commitment fee that varies according to its longterm debt credit rating the credit facility requires the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the facility of 065 to 100 or less and also contains customary representations warranties conditions precedent events of default indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants as of december 31 2014  no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility the nonperformance by any member of the credit facility syndicate would reduce the maximum capacity of the credit facility by such members commitment amount in addition to the credit facility the company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit 

the availability of the credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the company’s commercial paper programs the company expects to limit any borrowings under the credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow the company to borrow if needed to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the company’s ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of the company’s credit rating and market conditions any downgrade in the company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program and the credit facility and could limit or preclude the company’s ability to issue commercial paper if the company’s access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a downgrade change in market conditions or otherwise the company expects it would rely on a combination of available cash operating cash flow and the company’s credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the company’s credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2014  the company held approximately 30 billion  of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 04 of this amount 813 million was held within the united states and approximately 22 billion was held outside of the united states the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures and acquisitions to pay interest and service debt pay taxes and any related interest or penalties fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required repurchase shares of the company’s common stock pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions the company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or the credit facility enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs andor access the capital markets the company also may from time to time access the capital markets including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws most of the companys foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the united states but under current law could be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits for most of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states a deferred tax liability has been accrued for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the united states no provisions for us income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states and the amount of us income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ if it repatriated these earnings the cash that the companys foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately 118 billion  and 106 billion  respectively as of december 31 2014  management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states 

during 2014  the company contributed 52 million  to its us defined benefit pension plan and 62 million  to its nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2015  the company’s cash contribution requirements for its us and its nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 25 million  and 55 million  respectively the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of the company’s contractual obligations relating to continuing operations as of december 31 2014  under 1 longterm debt obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on the company’s balance sheet under gaap the amounts presented in the table below do not reflect 804 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits the timing of which is uncertain refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain refer to “—offbalance sheet arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below 

  



  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of offbalance sheet commitments of the company as of december 31 2014  

  



guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company’s obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company’s financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises the 

company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial statements 

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products or services or claims alleging that company products services or software infringe third party intellectual property the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the company’s trade accounts contract and finance receivable portfolios the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality the company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate with a severity frequency andor timing different from the companys assumptions additional allowances would be required and the company’s financial statements would be adversely impacted 

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s financial statements 

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess research and development and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur refer to notes 1 2 and 6 in the company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing its goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach the company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

as of december 31 2014 the company had twentytwo  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from 7 million  to 43 billion  the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014 indicated that in all instances the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 10 to approximately 1140 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 2 to approximately 1015 

the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

contingent liabilities  as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

revenue recognition  the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services refer to note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies 

although most of the company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that in some instances may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable the company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or salestype leases certain of the company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 

if the companys judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the companys revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected 

stockbased compensation  for a description of the company’s stockbased compensation accounting practices refer to note 17 to the company’s consolidated financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent the company’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment if actual results are not consistent with management’s assumptions and estimates the company’s equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

pension and other postretirement benefits  for a description of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices refer to notes 10 and 11 in the company’s consolidated financial statements calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors the company’s financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 150 million 94 million on an after tax basis and the nonus net obligation by 138 million 107 million on an after tax basis from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of december 31 2014 

for 2014 the estimated longterm rate of return for the us plan is 75 and the company intends to use an assumption of 75 for 2015 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan targets to invest between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds the company’s nonus plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 125 to 710 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2014 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2014 would have increased 10 million 6 million on an aftertax basis and 4 million 3 million on an aftertax basis respectively 

for a discussion of the company’s 2014 and anticipated 2015 defined benefit pension plan contributions please see “—liquidity and capital resources – cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes  for a description of the companys income tax accounting policies refer to notes 1 and 12 to the companys consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company’s financial statements 

the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when based upon the technical merits it is “morelikelythannot” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when i a tax audit is completed ii applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of the companys tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark see “—results of operations – income taxes and note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the companys financial statements including its effective tax rate 

an increase in the companys nominal tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended december 31 2014 of 35 million 

new accounting standards 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which impacts virtually all aspects of an entitys revenue recognition the core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 management has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard including possible transition alternatives on the companys financial statements

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher 

competition 

although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality delivery speed service and support innovation distribution network breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

backlog 

the table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our five segments as of december 31  in millions 

  

we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders as of december 31 2013  will be delivered to customers within three to four months of such date given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2013  we employed approximately 66000 persons of whom approximately 29000 were employed in the united states and approximately 37000 were employed outside of the united states of our united states employees approximately 1700 were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils for a discussion of risks related to employee relations please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

regulatory matters 

we face comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of our products software and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

environmental laws and regulations 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the generation use treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with our operations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition to environmental compliance costs we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the current and former owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and nonus environmental agencies that conditions at certain sites where we and others previously disposed of hazardous wastes andor are or were property owners require cleanup and other possible remedial action including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal and state environmental laws we have projects underway at a number of current and former facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations remediation activities generally relate to soil andor groundwater contamination and may include preremedial activities such as factfinding and investigation risk assessment feasibility study andor design as well as remediation actions such as contaminant removal monitoring andor installation operation and maintenance of longerterm remediation systems we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have made a provision for environmental investigation and remediation and environmentalrelated claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries and third party sites where we have been determined to be a potentially responsible party we generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with similar sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations if we determine that potential liability for a particular site or with respect to a personal injury claim is probable and reasonably estimable we accrue the total estimated loss including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site or claim as of december 31 2013  the company had a reserve of 133 million  for environmental matters which are probable and reasonably estimable of which 92 million  are noncurrent which reflects the company’s best estimate of the costs to be incurred with respect to such matters please see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our environmental reserves 

all reserves have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future third party recoveries while we actively pursue insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude

the fda’s regulatory requirements include 

 in the european union a single medical device regulatory approval process exists regulated products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality known as the “essential requirements” and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes unlike united states regulations which require most devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the fda the european union regulations allow manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the essential requirements for that device certain products must go through a more formal premarket review process we are also required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use in a timely manner to the competent authorities of the european union countries a number of other countries including australia brazil canada china and japan have also adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for medical devices sold in those countries

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions and since 2008 the effects of the global financial crisis have adversely impacted the global economy slower global economic growth the credit market crisis and european debt crisis uncertainty relating to the euro high levels of unemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration other austerity measures and other challenges affecting the global economy adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

improvement in the global economy remains uneven and uncertain if slower growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve continues for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy dont benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business   

from 2008 through 2013 we have implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases these circumstances could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial 

statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services   

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see “item 1 business  competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over third party reimbursement 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit 

companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct material violations of such standards of conduct could occur 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our acquisition of businesses joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details these acquisitions joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 

 19 

 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures may dilute the companys earnings per share have other adverse accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the us fda by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals such as 510k clearance for our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained failure to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of these regulations efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products injunctions administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product suspension or withdrawal of approvals and premarket notification rescissions we are also subject to various laws regulating 1 fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and 2 the privacy and security of health information including the federal regulations described in “item 1  business  regulatory matters” many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to and in some cases more stringent than such federal regulations for more information regarding regulations we are subject to please see “item 1  business  regulatory matters” 

failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation” compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses 

the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs which could adversely affect our financial statements 

the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs including the following 

 these changes have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products services from governmental agencies or third party payors reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the us and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business  regulatory matters” we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2013  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety healthcare medical device anticorruption and other regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage to our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment or require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business  regulatory matters” 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2013  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 223 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions please see the mda for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities such as the audits described in the mda and the companys financial statements due to the potential for changes to tax laws or the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate in addition any significant change to the tax system in the us or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2013  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products including software or services could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or bugs in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues with respect to or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products including software and services that we make or sell including products components or software that we source from third parties can lead to personal injury death property damage or other liability these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our reputation business and financial statements could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 35 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition based on the availability under our credit facilities as of december 31 2013  we had the ability to incur an additional 21 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisitions 

our current revolving credit facility and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us for more information please refer to the mda if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements in addition any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements   the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business  materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected in addition the 2012 rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission requiring public companies to disclose sourcing and other information regarding specified minerals “conflict minerals” may adversely affect the availability and pricing of certain of these minerals and increase our compliance costs 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers including freight carriers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any 

significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity results of operations and reputation 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2013 approximately 58 of our sales were derived from customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the us since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in the highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the third party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities these systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in addition security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like many multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is designed to provide a reader of danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of company management the company’s mda is divided into five sections 

 overview 

general 

please see “item 1 business – general” for a discussion of danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations during 2013  approximately 58 of danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a diversified global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of its products and services typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results given the broad range of products manufactured software and services provided and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of the company’s geographic and industry diversity the company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges including rapid technological development particularly with respect to computing mobile connectivity communications and digitization in most of the company’s served markets the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force consolidation of the company’s competitors and increasing regulation the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and the company’s longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in highgrowth geographies and highgrowth market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products services and software with higher gross profit margins expand and improve the effectiveness of the company’s sales force continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment the company is making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources particularly in highgrowth markets in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations 

business performance and outlook 

while differences exist among the company’s businesses on an overall basis demand for the company’s products software and services increased in 2013  compared to 2012  resulting in aggregate yearoveryear sales growth from existing businesses in addition the company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other businessspecific factors discussed below contributed to yearoveryear sales growth geographically yearoveryear sales growth rates from existing businesses during 2013  were led primarily by the highgrowth markets sales from existing businesses in highgrowth markets grew at a highsingle digit rate in 2013 compared to 2012 and represented approximately 26 of the companys total sales in 2013 sales from existing businesses in developed markets grew at a lowsingle digit rate compared to 2012 and were driven by north america and japan which grew at lowsingle digit rates in 2013 partially offset by slight yearoveryear contraction in western europe western europe did grow slightly in the second half of 2013 on a yearoveryear basis the company expects overall market conditions to remain challenging due to macroeconomic uncertainties and monetary and fiscal policies of countries where we do business while individual businesses and end markets continue to experience volatility the company expects sales from existing businesses to grow on a yearoveryear basis during 2014 with sales growth returning to the industrial technologies segment and the other segments growing at rates similar to those experienced in 2013 

restructuring activities 

in light of the continuing uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment and consistent with the companys approach of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner in july 2013 the company initiated actions to improve productivity and reduce costs in the companys businesses the actions which were substantially completed by december 31 2013  resulted in pretax charges of over 100 million the majority of which was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2013  the charges including both employeerelated termination costs as well as other termination and exit costs are expected to result in savings of approximately 75 million in 2014 compared to 2013  expense levels 

in addition the company incurred 123 million  of costs associated with restructuring activities in 2012  which resulted in savings of approximately 90 million in 2013  compared to 2012  expense levels 

acquisitions 

during 2013  the company acquired fourteen  businesses for total consideration of 957 million  in cash net of cash acquired the businesses acquired complement existing units of the industrial technologies life sciences  diagnostics environmental and test  measurement segments the aggregate annual sales of these fourteen  businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately 300 million  

for a discussion of the company’s 2012 and 2011 acquisition activity refer to “liquidity and capital resources — investing activities” 

sale of investments 

during 2010 the company entered into a joint venture with cooper industries plc “cooper” combining certain of the company’s hand tool businesses with cooper’s tools business to form a new entity called apex tool group llc “apex” in february 2013 the company and cooper sold apex to an unrelated third party for approximately 16 billion  the company received 797 million  from the sale consisting of cash of 759 million  including 67 million  of dividends received prior to closing and a note receivable of 38 million  the company recognized an aftertax gain of 144 million  or 020  per diluted share in connection with this transaction as of december 31 2013 the company had collected the majority of this note receivable 

during the fourth quarter of 2013  the company sold approximately 5 million  of the approximately 8 million  shares of align technology inc align common stock that the company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between align and ormco corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of the company the company received cash proceeds of 251 million  from the sale of these securities and recorded a pretax gain of 202 million   125 million  aftertax or 018  per diluted share 

results of operations 

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2013  increased 45 compared to 2012  sales from existing businesses contributed 25 growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 25 growth on a yearoveryear basis the impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 05 as the us dollar was on average stronger against other major currencies during 2013  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2012  

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 135 compared to 2011 sales from existing businesses contributed 25 growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 130 growth on a yearoveryear basis the impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 20 as the us dollar was on average stronger against other major currencies during 2012 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2011 

in this report references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 1 sales from acquired businesses and 2 the impact of currency translation references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the impact from the divestiture of a product line the sales from which prior to the divestiture were included in sales from acquired businesses the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses and b the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by 

helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and excludes the effect of acquisitions and related items because the nature size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales

operating profit margins declined 30 basis points during 2012 compared to 2011 the incremental net dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 105 basis points higher sales volumes and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011 net of incremental yearoveryear costs associated with various sales marketing and product development growth investments increased operating profit margins by 75 basis points on a yearoveryear basis 

cost of sales and gross profit 

  



gross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2013  compared to 2012  due primarily to the   favorable impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes the yearoveryear decline in restructuring costs and continued productivity improvements in 2013 the us imposed a 23 excise tax on the sale or importation of certain medical devices which affected various products in the companys life sciences  diagnostics and dental segments the excise tax increased the companys 2013 cost of sales as a percentage of revenue on a yearoveryear basis by approximately 20 basis points the impact of the medical devices excise tax was partially mitigated by general price increases implemented during 2013 

gross profit margins increased 80 basis points during 2012  as compared to 2011  yearoveryear gross profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by 70 basis points as a result of acquisition related charges recorded in 2011 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of beckman coulter in june 2011 in addition yearoveryear gross profit margin comparisons benefited from higher yearoveryear sales volumes the yearoveryear decline in restructuring costs and ongoing productivity improvements the impact of a full twelve months of beckman coulter results in 2012 compared to only six months of beckman coulter results in 2011 partially offset these positive factors as the beckman coulter business had lower gross profit margins on average than the companys existing businesses 

operating expenses 

  



selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained flat from 2012 to 2013  the benefit of increased leverage of the companys cost base resulting from higher 2013 sales and the yearoveryear decline in restructuring costs was offset by incremental yearoveryear increases in investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives yearoveryear comparisons were also adversely impacted by an impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with a communications business technology investment which increased selling general and administrative expenses by 15 basis points in 2013 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2012 compared to 2011 increased leverage of the companys cost base resulting from higher sales and the yearoveryear decline in restructuring costs were partially offset by incremental yearoveryear investments in sales and marketing growth investments yearoveryear comparisons were also favorably impacted by a mark to market gain on a currency swap arrangement in 2012 refer to “financial instruments and risk management—currency exchange rate risk” in addition change in control payments to beckman coulter employees in connection with the closing of the beckman coulter acquisition in june 2011 as well as associated restructuring and integration charges favorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison 

research and development expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points on a yearoveryear basis in 2013 as compared to 2012 incremental yearoveryear increases in investments in the companys new product development initiatives were the primary contributors to this increase research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively consistent for 2012 as compared to 2011 

earnings from unconsolidated joint venture 

during 2010 the company entered into a joint venture with cooper combining certain of the company’s hand tool businesses with cooper’s tools business to form a new entity called apex in february 2013 the company and cooper sold apex to an unrelated third party for approximately 16 billion  the company received 797 million  from the sale consisting of cash of 759 million  including 67 million  of dividends received prior to closing and a note receivable of 38 million  the company recognized a pretax gain of 230 million  aftertax gain of 144 million  or 020  per diluted share in connection with this transaction this gain is reflected as gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture in the consolidated statement of earnings as of december 31 2013 the company had collected the majority of this note receivable 

the companys share of the 2013 earnings generated by apex prior to the closing of the sale was insignificant  the company recorded 70 million  and 67 million  of earnings for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively reflecting its 50  ownership position subsequent to the sale of its investment in apex the company has no continuing involvement in apexs operations 

other income expense 

during the fourth quarter of 2013  the company sold approximately 5 million  of the approximately 8 million  shares of align common stock that the company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between align and ormco corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of the company the company received cash proceeds of 251 million  from the sale of these securities and recorded a pretax gain of 202 million   125 million  aftertax or 018  per diluted share this gain is reflected as gain on sale of marketable equity securities in the consolidated statement of earnings 

refer to “—earnings from unconsolidated joint venture above for information related to the 230 million  gain on the sale of apex in 2013 and to “—liquidity and capital resources – beckman coulter indebtedness below for information related to the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2011 

interest costs 

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness refer to “—liquidity and capital resources – financing activities and indebtedness” below 

interest expense of 146 million  for 2013  was 12 million  lower than in 2012  due primarily to the repayment of the €500 million principal amount of eurobond notes due 2013 the eurobond notes and the 300 million principal amount of floating rate unsecured senior notes due 2013 the 2013 notes upon maturity in july and june 2013 respectively the companys average commercial paper borrowings were also lower in 2013 as compared to 2012 interest expense of 158 million  in 2012  was 16 million higher than the 2011  interest expense of 142 million  due primarily to the additional debt incurred in connection with the beckman coulter acquisition the companys average commercial paper borrowings were also higher in 2012  as compared to 2011  in large part due to borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition of beckman coulter 

interest income was 6 million  3 million  and 5 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states refer to “—liquidity and capital resources – cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

yearoveryear changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  was 244  236  and 209  respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate for each of 2013  2012  and 2011  differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate in addition the effective tax rates of 244  in 2013  236  in 2012  and 209  in 2011 are lower than the us federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations the effective tax rate for 2013 is also lower than the us federal statutory rate due to the retroactive reinstatement of certain tax benefits and credits resulting from the enactment of the american tax relief act of 2012 these favorable items were offset by adjustments of reserve estimates related to prior period uncertain tax positions and ongoing audit settlement estimates in various jurisdictions the matters referenced above have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and in the aggregate reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 20  basis points in 2013  30  basis points in 2012  and 240  basis points in 2011  

the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the united states federal state and foreign jurisdictions the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities during 2013 the internal revenue service “irs” completed examinations of certain of the companys federal income tax returns for the years 2008 and 2009 and has commenced its examinations of the companys federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2011 in addition the company has subsidiaries in belgium brazil canada denmark france finland germany india italy japan norway singapore sweden the united kingdom and various other countries states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2000 through 2012 

tax authorities in denmark and germany have raised significant issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the companys subsidiaries on december 10 2013 the company received assessments from the danish tax authority “skat” totaling approximately dkk 11 billion  approximately 200 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2013 imposing withholding tax and interest thereon relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the companys subsidiaries for the years 20042009 if the skat claims are successful it is likely that the company would be assessed additional amounts for years through 2013 totaling approximately dkk 800 million  approximately 144 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2013 as well as future interest on the disputed withholding tax for subsequent periods prior to such a determination discussions with the german tax authorities are ongoing and final assessments have not been issued 

management believes the positions the company has taken in both denmark and germany are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend its positions including contesting the skat assessment however the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain could take many years and individually or in the aggregate could result in a material adverse impact to the companys financial statements including its effective tax rate 

the companys effective tax rate for 2014  is expected to be approximately 24 this anticipated rate reflects no benefit from the research and experimentation credit in the united states which expired at the end of 2013 

inflation 

the effect of inflation on the company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in the years ended december 31 2013  2012  or 2011  

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices each of which could impact its financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2013  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock by approximately 110 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity 

as of december 31 2013  the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar commercial paper borrowings refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2013  as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature the company anticipates issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2013  a 50 increase in average market interest rates on the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 04 million a 50 hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2013  

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of our applicable subsidiary the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars danaher’s functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular 

the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at december 31 2013  would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 750 million 

currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2013  reported sales by 05 on a yearoveryear basis as the us dollar was on average stronger against other major currencies during 2013  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2012  the us dollars strength against other major currencies throughout the majority of 2013 more than offset the positive impact on sales from the slight weakening of the us dollar prior to the end of the fourth quarter 2013 

if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2013  were to prevail throughout 2014  currency exchange rates would positively impact 2014  estimated sales by approximately 05 relative to the company’s performance in 2013  additional weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in connection with a prior acquisition the company acquired a currency swap agreement that required the company to purchase approximately 184 million  japanese yen jpy¥ at a rate of 1 ¥10225  on a monthly basis through june 1 2018 during 2013 the company terminated portions of the currency swap agreement reducing the companys monthly purchase commitment to approximately ¥27 million  in connection with the partial termination of the currency swap agreement the company paid 10 million  to the swap counterparties representing the fair value of the terminated portions of the currency swap as of december 31 2013  the aggregate japanese yen purchase commitment was approximately ¥14 billion  approximately 14 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2013  the currency swap does not qualify for hedge accounting and as a result changes in the fair value of the currency swap are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings each reporting period during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011 the company recorded pretax income of 14 million  and 22 million  and a pretax charge of 8 million  respectively related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and with the exception of the yen swap noted above such transactions are generally insignificant to the companys financial condition and results of operations these transactions are entered into only with highquality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited 

equity price risk 

the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities a 10 decline in the value of these equity securities as of december 31 2013  would have reduced the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio by 39 million 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer “item 1a risk factors” 

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses consummating strategic acquisitions paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

  



 46 

 operating activities

 operating cash flows from continuing operations were 35 billion  for 2012  an increase of 770 million or 28 as compared to 2011  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings in 2012 as compared to 2011 

investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets 

net cash used in investing activities was 553 million  during 2013  compared to 19 billion  of net cash used in 2012  and 58 billion  of net cash used in 2011  

acquisitions and divestitures

financing activities and indebtedness 

cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper common stock and debt excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation payments of principal on indebtedness payments for repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders financing activities used cash of 16 billion  during 2013  compared to 388 million  of cash used during 2012  the yearoveryear increase was due primarily to the repayment of the eurobond notes and the 2013 notes upon their maturity in july and june 2013 respectively and the incrementally higher yearoveryear net repayment of commercial paper borrowings 

total debt was 35 billion  and 53 billion as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the company’s debt as of december 31 2013  was as follows 

 the 2011 financing notes the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes are collectively referred to as the “notes” 

commercial paper programs and credit facility 

the company satisfies any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flow and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under its us and euro commercial paper programs under these programs the company or a subsidiary of the company as applicable may issue and sell unsecured shortterm promissory notes interest expense on the notes is paid at maturity and is generally based on the ratings assigned to the company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to libor borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions during 2013  as commercial paper balances matured the company either paid such balances from available cash or refinanced such balances by issuing new commercial paper there was no commercial paper outstanding under the euro program as of december 31 2013 

as of december 31 2013  borrowings outstanding under the company’s us commercial paper program had a weighted average annual interest rate of 01  and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately fourteen  days commercial paper outstanding at any one time during the year had balances ranging from 450 million to 12 billion carried interest at annual rates ranging between 01  and 02  and had original maturities between one  and sixty  days the company has classified its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2013  and its 2014 notes as longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet as the company had the intent and ability as supported by availability under the credit facility referenced below to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date 

credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by a 25 billion unsecured multiyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on july 15 2016 the “credit facility” the credit facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes under the credit facility borrowings other than bid loans bear interest at a rate equal to at the company’s option either 1 a liborbased rate plus a margin that varies according to the company’s longterm debt credit rating the “eurodollar rate” or 2 the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 12 of 1 b the prime rate and c the eurodollar rate plus 1 plus in each case a margin that varies according to the company’s longterm debt credit rating in addition to certain initial fees the company paid at inception of the credit facility the company is obligated to pay an annual commitment fee that varies according to its longterm debt credit rating the credit facility requires the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the facility of 065 to 100 or less and also contains customary representations warranties conditions precedent events of default indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants as of december 31 2013  no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility the nonperformance by any member of the credit facility syndicate would reduce the maximum capacity of the credit facility by such members commitment amount in addition to the credit facility the company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit 

the availability of the credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the company’s commercial paper program the company expects to limit any borrowings under the credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow the company to borrow if needed to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the company’s ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of the company’s credit rating and market conditions any downgrade in the company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program and the credit facility and could limit or preclude the company’s ability to issue commercial paper if the company’s access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a downgrade change in market conditions or otherwise the company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash operating cash flow and the company’s credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the company’s credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

on june 17 2011 the company entered into a 30 billion 364day unsecured revolving credit facility the “364day facility” in connection with the acquisition of beckman coulter the company terminated the facility as of december 29 2011 there were no outstanding borrowings under the 364day facility at any time during the term of the facility

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2013  the company held 31 billion  of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 03 932 million of this amount was held within the united states and 22 billion was held outside of the united states the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures and acquisitions to pay interest and service debt pay taxes and any related interest or penalties fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required repurchase shares of the company’s common stock pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions the company may also borrow under its commercial paper program or the credit facility enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program andor access the capital markets the company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions with respect to the 2014 notes that mature in 2014 the company expects to repay the principal amounts when due under these notes using available cash proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper andor proceeds from other debt issuances 

while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws most of the companys foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the united states but under current law could be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits for most of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states a deferred tax liability has been accrued for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the united states no provisions for us income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states and the amount of us income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ if it repatriated these earnings the cash that the companys foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions as of december 31 2013  and 2012  the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately 106 billion  and 93 billion  respectively as of december 31 2013  management believes that is has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states 

during 2013  the company contributed 4 million  to its us defined benefit pension plan and 53 million  to its nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2014  the company’s cash contribution requirements for its us and its nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 50 million  and 50 million  respectively the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of offbalance sheet commitments of the company as of december 31 2013  

  



guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company’s obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company’s financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial statements 

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products or services or claims alleging that company products services or software infringe third party intellectual property the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding certain litigation matters 

in addition to the litigation matters noted under “item 1 business – regulatory matters – environmental health  safety” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities these matters primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the company’s products software and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture related matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement the company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive consequential andor compensatory damages as well as injunctive relief based upon the company’s experience current information and applicable law it does not believe it is reasonably possible that these proceedings and claims will have a material effect on its financial statements 

while the company maintains general products property workers’ compensation automobile cargo aviation crime fiduciary and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions up to certain limits that cover certain of these claims this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses for general products and property liability and most other insured risks the company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the selfinsured retention in addition while the company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses 

in accordance with accounting guidance the company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued if a loss does not meet the known or probable level but is reasonably possible and a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed the companys reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk professionals where appropriate in addition outside risk professionals assist in the 

determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors reserve estimates may be adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including litigation developments the discovery of new facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy while the company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude if the company’s selfinsurance and litigation reserves prove inadequate it would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements please see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the amount of our accruals for selfinsurance and litigation liability

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the company’s trade accounts contract and finance receivable portfolios the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality the company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate with a severity frequency andor timing different from the companys assumptions additional allowances would be required and the company’s financial statements would be adversely impacted 

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s financial statements 

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess research and development and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur refer to notes 1 2 and 7 in the company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing its goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach the company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as 

judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

as of december 31 2013 the company had twentytwo  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from 7 million  to 44 billion  the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2013 indicated that in all instances the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 3 to approximately 885 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 7 to approximately 785 two reporting units’ hypothetically 10 decreased fair values were lower than their respective carrying values management evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of these reporting units including as applicable the short period of time since the acquisition of these businesses results of the estimate of fair value using the income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance and concluded no impairment charge was required 

the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

contingent liabilities  as discussed above under “—liquidity and capital resources – legal proceedings” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed above under “—liquidity and capital resources – legal proceedings” if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

revenue recognition  the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services refer to note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies 

although most of the company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy that in some instances may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable the company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or salestype leases certain of the company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 

if the companys judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the companys revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected 

stockbased compensation  for a description of the company’s stockbased compensation accounting practices refer to note 18 to the company’s consolidated financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent the company’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment if actual results are not consistent with management’s assumptions and estimates the company’s equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

pension and other postretirement benefits  for a description of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices refer to notes 11 and 12 in the company’s consolidated financial statements calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors the company’s financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 130 million 81 million on an after tax basis and the nonus net obligation by 109 million 77 million on an after tax basis from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of december 31 2013 

for 2013 the estimated longterm rate of return for the us plan is 75 and the company intends to use an assumption of 75 for 2014 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan targets to invest between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds the company’s nonus plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 125 to 670 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2013 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2013 would have increased 9 million 6 million on an aftertax basis and 4 million 3 million on an aftertax basis respectively 

for a discussion of the company’s 2013 and anticipated 2014 defined benefit pension plan contributions please see “—liquidity and capital resources  cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes  for a description of the companys income tax accounting policies refer to notes 1 and 13 to the companys consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company’s financial statements 

the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when based upon the technical merits it is “morelikelythannot” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when i a tax audit is completed ii applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of the companys tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark and germany see “—results of operations – income taxes and note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the companys financial statements including its effective tax rate 

an increase in our nominal tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 of 36 million

the following discussion includes information common to all of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including steel copper cast iron electronic components aluminum plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas also affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2012  we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on our business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher 

competition 

although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the range of the products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality delivery speed service and support innovation distribution network breadth of product and service offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and endmarkets that they serve for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

backlog 

the table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our five segments at the end of 2012  and 2011   in millions 

  



we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders as of december 31 2012  will be delivered to customers within 3 to 4 months of such date given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

employee relations 

at december 31 2012  we employed approximately 63000 persons of whom approximately 26000 were employed in the united states and approximately 37000 were employed outside of the united states of our united states employees approximately 1900 were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils for a discussion of risks related to employee relations please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2012  was from customers other than governmental entities each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

we face comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

environmental laws and regulations 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the generation use treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with our operations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition to environmental compliance costs we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the current and former owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and nonus environmental agencies that conditions at certain sites where we and others previously disposed of hazardous wastes andor are or were property owners require cleanup and other possible remedial action including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal and state environmental laws we have projects underway at a number of current and former facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations remediation activities generally relate to soil andor groundwater contamination and may include preremedial activities such as factfinding and investigation risk assessment feasibility study andor design as well as remediation actions such as contaminant removal monitoring andor installation operation and maintenance of longerterm remediation systems we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have made a provision for environmental investigation and remediation and environmentalrelated claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries and thirdparty sites where we have been determined to be a potentially responsible party we generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with similar sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations if we determine that potential liability for a particular site or with respect to a personal injury claim is probable and reasonably estimable we accrue the total estimated loss including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site or claim as of december 31 2012  the company had a reserve of 143 million  for environmental matters which are probable and reasonably estimable of which 94 million  are noncurrent which reflects the company’s best estimate of the costs to be incurred with respect to such matters please see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our environmental reserves 

all reserves have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future third party recoveries while we actively pursue insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude

the fda’s regulatory requirements include 

 in the european union a single medical device regulatory approval process exists regulated products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality known as the “essential requirements” and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes unlike united states regulations which require most devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the fda the european union regulations allow manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the essential requirements for that device certain products must go through a more formal premarket review process we are also required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use in a timely manner to the competent authorities of the european union countries a number of other countries including australia brazil canada china and japan have also adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for medical devices sold in those countries

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states slower global economic growth credit market crisis high levels of unemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures government deficit reduction sequestration and other austerity measures and other challenges affecting the global economy adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 in particular the european debt crisis the instability and uncertainty relating to the euro and generally weak economic conditions in europe have constrained government budgets limited the financing available to our suppliers and customers and adversely affected demand for our products the availability of supplies and the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations 

in addition although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

if slower growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve continues for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy dont benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business   

in 2008 2009 2011 and 2012 we implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and technologies adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases these circumstances could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth 

in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses product demand depends on customers capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities our product demand is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products   

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see “item 1 business  competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrate new markets including in developing countries our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new products and product enhancements on a timely basis our products will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims rules competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper 

payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions in our current and anticipated business areas is significant and may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies 

our acquisition of businesses including our acquisition of beckman coulter could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details in particular as of the date of this report the acquisition of beckman coulter inc in june 2011 was danahers largest acquisition and has expanded danahers business into new markets our acquisitions involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 

 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated timeframe and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures may dilute the companys earnings per share have other adverse accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the fda by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials for more information regarding these regulations please see “item 1  business  regulatory matters” we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance such as 510k clearance for our new products or modifications to or additional indications or uses of existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance it may be timeconsuming costly and subject to restrictions our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances will depend on many factors including our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained failure to obtain such regulatory clearances before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or additional indications or uses of our products other violations of these regulations efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products injunctions administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product suspension or withdrawal of approvals and premarket notification rescissions we are also subject to various laws regulating 1 fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and 2 the privacy and security of health information including the federal regulations described in “item 1  business  regulatory matters” many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to and in some cases more stringent than such federal regulations for more information regarding these regulations please see “item 1  business  regulatory matters” 

failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation” compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses 

the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs which could adversely affect our financial statements 

the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs including the following 

 20 

measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or endusers of our products and services global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement 

 these changes may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services increase our tax liabilities and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business  regulatory matters” we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2012  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the anticorruption environmental health safety healthcare and medical devicerelated regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the federal state and local levels including the following 

 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties damage to our reputation disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies damage to our reputation and loss of customers and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the iso and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business  regulatory matters” 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2012  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 218 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services purchased overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions please see the mda for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities due to the potential for changes to tax law and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities intercompany transactions associated with the sale or licensing of inventory services and intellectual property are complex and can also affect our tax liabilities in addition any significant change to the tax system in the united states or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters these 

lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and similar proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and similar proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2012  will have a material effect on our financial statements 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues with respect to or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products that we make or sell including in products or components that we source from third parties can lead to personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 53 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition based on the availability under our credit facilities as of december 31 2012  we had the ability to incur an additional 13 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisitions 

our current revolving credit facility and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us for more information please refer to the mda if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition in addition any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance or purchasing patterns of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors products and if they favor our competitors products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements   the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare could adversely impact our profitability 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in “item 1 business  materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole sources of supply for certain materials and components could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our costs may increase conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand for our products in addition regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

international economic political legal and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2012 approximately 57 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in highgrowth markets such as china india brazil and the middle east our international business and particularly our business in emerging markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 25 

 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to these and other risks will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against losses 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities we also collect and store sensitive data including confidential business information and personal data these systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events in addition security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers any such events could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws each of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses grew at a highsingle digit rate during 2011 sales growth rates declined in the second half of 2011 compared to growth rates in the first half of 2011 in part due to easier prior year comparisons in the first half of 2011 as well as the impact of slowing demand on a global basis in the second half of 2011 primarily in the technologyrelated and solar end markets yearoveryear sales increases in engineered solutions and linear and mechanical motion products during the second half of 2011 more than offset sales declines in industrial automation that occurred primarily in the fourth quarter 2011 sales grew in all major geographies 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses grew collectively at a midteens rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 due to generally higher demand in the majority of endmarkets served 

operating profit margins increased 80 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010 yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons benefited 135 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and ongoing productivity improvements the net dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points 

cost of sales and gross profit 

  



gross profit margins increased 80 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2012  compared to 2011  yearoveryear gross profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by 70 basis points as a result of acquisition related charges recorded in 2011 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of beckman coulter in june 2011 in addition yearoveryear gross profit margin comparisons also benefited from 

higher yearoveryear sales volumes incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with 2011 restructuring activities net of 2012 restructuring spending and ongoing productivity improvements the impact of a full twelve months of beckman coulter results in 2012 compared to only six months of beckman coulter results in 2011 partially offset these positive factors as the beckman coulter business has lower gross profit margins on average than the companys existing businesses 

gross profit margins decreased 20 basis points during 2011  as compared to 2010  the combination of the acquisition of beckman coulter which has lower gross profit margins on average than the company’s existing businesses and 35 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2011 compared to 2010 adversely impacted yearoveryear gross profit margin comparisons in addition acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of beckman coulter net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010 relating primarily to the ab sciex molecular devices and certain other acquisitions adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points higher yearoveryear sales volumes and ongoing productivity improvements partially offset these adverse impacts the gross profit margin comparison also reflects the benefit of 65 basis points from the contribution to the apex joint venture at the beginning of the third quarter 2010 of certain of the company’s hand tools businesses which had lower average gross profit margins than the remainder of the company 

in 2010 the us government passed health care reform legislation which among other provisions imposes a 23 excise tax on the sale or importation of certain medical devices these provisions apply to various products in the companys life sciences and diagnostics and dental segments and become effective in 2013 the excise tax is expected to increase the companys cost of sales in 2013 by approximately 35 million compared to 2012 

operating expenses 

  



selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2012  compared to 2011  increased leverage of the companys cost base resulting from higher sales and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with 2011 restructuring activities net of 2012 restructuring activities were partially offset by incremental yearoveryear investments in the companys sales and marketing growth investments yearoveryear comparisons were also favorably impacted by a mark to market gain on a currency swap arrangement in 2012 refer to “financial instruments and risk management—currency exchange rate risk” in addition change in control payments to beckman coulter employees in connection with the closing of the beckman coulter acquisition in june 2011 as well as associated restructuring and integration charges favorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2011 as compared to 2010 increased leverage of the company’s cost base resulting from higher sales volumes during 2011 was partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2011 compared to 2010 and ongoing investments in the company’s sales growth initiatives in addition change in control payments to beckman coulter employees in connection with the closing of the beckman coulter acquisition adversely impacted selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales during 2011 

research and development expenses consist principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs research and development expenses have remained relatively consistent as a percentage of sales over the last three years the increase in these expenses on a yearoveryear basis is primarily attributable to the full year impact of research and development expenditures associated with recently acquired businesses primarily beckman coulter as well as incremental yearoveryear investments in the companys new product development initiatives 

earnings from unconsolidated joint venture 

in july 2010 the company closed on the formation of the apex joint venture as of the closing of the transaction the company deconsolidated its contributed businesses and commenced accounting for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting the equity in the earnings of apex reflecting the company’s 50 ownership position subsequent to the formation is reflected in the earnings from unconsolidated joint venture caption in the consolidated statements of earnings 

the impact on the company’s results of operations from 1 the contributed business prior to the formation of apex and 2 the company’s equity in the earnings of apex subsequent to the formation of apex is reflected in the table below  in millions 

  



earnings from unconsolidated joint venture increased 3 million  for 2012  as compared to 2011  primarily due to the favorable impact of higher production volumes and apexs actions to improve overall cost productivity earnings from unconsolidated joint venture increased 44 million in 2011  as compared to 2010  as 2011  reflected a full year of earnings as compared to only six months of earnings in 2010 following the closing of the formation of the joint venture in july 2010 

interest costs 

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness refer to “–liquidity and capital resources – financing activities and indebtedness” below 

interest expense of 158 million  for 2012  was approximately 16 million  higher than in 2011  the increase in interest expense in 2012  results primarily from the additional debt incurred during the second quarter of 2011 in connection with the beckman coulter acquisition interest expense of 142 million  in 2011  was approximately 25 million higher than 2010  interest expense of 117 million  the increase in interest expense during 2011  also results primarily from the additional debt incurred in connection with the beckman coulter acquisition the companys average commercial paper borrowings were also higher in 2011  as compared to 2010  in large part due to borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition of beckman coulter 

interest income of 3 million  5 million  and 6 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively was essentially flat on a yearoveryear basis 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions and changes in tax laws for a description of the tax treatment of earnings held outside the united states refer to “—cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves are adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  was 236  209  and 229  respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate for each of 2012  2011  and 2010  differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate 

the effective tax rate of 236  in 2012  is also lower than the us federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolution of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations in addition to changes in estimates related to reserves associated with prior period uncertain tax positions these matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 30 basis points in 2012  

the effective tax rate of 209  in 2011  is also lower than the us federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions as a result of a tax ruling court decision and the lapse of certain tax statutes of limitations in addition to changes in estimates related to reserves associated with prior period uncertain tax positions these matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 240 basis points in 2011  

the company’s 2010  effective tax rate of 229  is also lower than the us federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolution of certain international and domestic tax positions and the lapse of certain tax statutes of limitations these matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 60 basis points in 2010  

on january 2 2013 the american tax relief act of 2012 the act was signed into law which included tax relief for businesses by reinstating retroactively to january 1 2012 certain tax benefits and credits that had expired included in the reinstatement were the us federal research and development tax credit and the controlled foreign corporation lookthrough provision which would have collectively lowered the companys effective tax rate by approximately 75 basis points for 2012 however as the act was enacted in 2013 the retroactive tax benefit was not included in the 2012 effective tax rate and will be treated as a discrete benefit during the first quarter of 2013 

the effective tax rate for 2013  is expected to be approximately 24 excluding the discrete benefit from the act noted above the anticipated increase from the 2012  rate is primarily attributable to changes in international tax legislation partially offset by the benefit on 2013s effective tax rate from the reinstatement of the tax benefits under the act noted above 

inflation 

the effect of inflation on the company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in the years ended december 31 2012  2011  or 2010  

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices each of which could impact its financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2012  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock by approximately 137 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity 

as of december 31 2012  the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and euro denominated commercial paper borrowings and to a lesser extent the companys 300 million floating rate senior notes due 2013 as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar and euro interest rates refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2012  as these shorter duration obligations mature the company anticipates issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2012  a 150 increase in average market interest rates on the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 2 million a 150 hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2012  in 2012  a 50 increase in average market interest rates on the company’s 300 million floating rate senior notes due 2013 would have increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 1 million a 50 hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company’s actual coupon interest rates on such debt fluctuated near that amount during 2012  

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries the eurobond notes described below provide a natural hedge to a portion of the company’s european net asset position the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries net of the translation effect of the company’s eurobond notes is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at december 31 2012  net of the translation effect of the company’s eurobond notes would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 706 million 

the company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred and sales are generated in foreign currencies costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively 

currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2012  sales by 20 on a yearoveryear basis as the us dollar was on average stronger against other major currencies during 2012  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2011  the us dollars strength against other major currencies throughout the majority of 2012 more than offset the positive impact on sales from the slight weakening of the us dollar prior to the end of the fourth quarter 2012 

if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2012  were to prevail throughout 2013  currency exchange rates would positively impact 2013  sales by approximately 05 relative to the company’s performance in 2012  additional weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations 

any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in connection with a 2011 acquisition the company acquired a currency swap agreement that requires the company to purchase approximately 184 million  japanese yen jpy¥ at a rate of 1 ¥10225  on a monthly basis through june 1 2018 as of december 31 2012  the aggregate japanese yen purchase commitment was approximately ¥119 billion  approximately 138 million  based on exchange rates as of december 31 2012  the currency swap does not qualify for hedge accounting and as a result changes in the fair value of the currency swap are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings during the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  the company recorded pretax income of approximately 22 million  and a pretax charge of approximately 8 million  respectively related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and with the exception of the yen swap noted above such transactions are generally insignificant to the companys financial condition and results of operations these transactions are entered into only with highquality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited 

equity price risk 

the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities a 10 decline in the value of these equity securities as of december 31 2012  would have reduced the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio by approximately 33 million 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer “item 1a risk factors” 

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses consummating strategic acquisitions paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

  



 operating activities 

the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes restructuring activities pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were 35 billion  for 2012  an increase of 770 million  or 28  as compared to 2011  the yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from 2011  to 2012  was primarily attributable to the following factors 

 operating cash flows from continuing operations were 27 billion  for 2011  an increase of 713 million or 35 as compared to 2010  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings in 2011 as compared to 2010 in addition trade accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable in the aggregate contributed 63 million of operating cash flows during 2011  as compared to using 195 million in operating cash flows during 2010  

in connection with the company’s restructuring activities the company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing facilities severing personnel and in connection with acquisitions integrating the acquired businesses into existing company operations cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with these activities during 2012  the company paid 140 million related to its 2012  and 2011  restructuring activities during 2011  the company paid approximately 49 million related to its 2011  restructuring activities the company anticipates cash payments of approximately 94 million during 2013  related to its 2012  restructuring activities please refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these expenditures 

investing activities

financing activities and indebtedness 

cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper common stock and debt excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation payments of principal on indebtedness payments for repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders financing activities used cash of 388 million  during 2012  compared to 21 billion  of cash provided during 2011  the yearoveryear change was primarily due to the companys repurchase of shares of its common stock at a cost of 648 million  in 2012 whereas in 2011 the company received 18 billion  from the issuance of the 2011 financing notes as defined below 

total debt was 53 billion  as of december 31 2012  and 2011  the company’s debt as of december 31 2012  was as follows 

 the 2011 financing notes the eurobond notes the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes are collectively referred to as the “notes” 

commercial paper programs and credit facility 

the company satisfies any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flow and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under its us and euro commercial paper programs under these programs the company or a subsidiary of the company as applicable may issue and sell unsecured shortterm promissory notes interest expense on the notes is paid at maturity and is generally based on the ratings assigned to the company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to libor borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions during 2012  as commercial paper balances matured the company either paid such balances from available cash or refinanced such balances by issuing new commercial paper the company issued commercial paper under the euro commercial paper program during 2012 and as of december 31 2012  66 million   €50 million  of commercial paper was outstanding under this program there was no commercial paper outstanding under the euro program as of december 31 2011 or at any other time during 2011 

as of december 31 2012  borrowings outstanding under the company’s us and euro commercial paper programs had a weighted average annual interest rate of 02  and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately seven  days commercial paper balances during the year carried interest at annual rates ranging between 01  and 07  and original maturities between one  and thirtysix  days the company classified its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs as of december 31 2012  as well as its 2013 notes and its eurobond notes as longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet as the company had the intent and ability as supported by availability under the credit facility referenced below to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date 

credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by a 25 billion unsecured multiyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on july 15 2016 the “credit facility” the credit facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes under the credit facility borrowings other than bid loans bear interest at a rate equal to at the company’s option either 1 a liborbased rate plus a margin that varies according to the company’s longterm debt credit rating the “eurodollar rate” or 2 the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 12 of 1 b the prime rate and c the eurodollar rate plus 1 plus in each case a margin that varies according to the company’s longterm debt credit rating in addition to certain initial fees the company paid at inception of the credit facility the company is obligated to pay an annual commitment fee that varies according to its longterm debt credit rating the credit facility requires the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the facility of 065 to 100 or less and also contains customary representations warranties conditions precedent events of default indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants as of december 31 2012  no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility the nonperformance by any member of the credit facility syndicate would reduce the maximum capacity of the credit facility by such members commitment amount in addition to the credit facility the company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit 

the availability of the credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the company’s commercial paper program the company expects to limit any borrowings under the credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow the company to borrow if needed to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the company’s ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of the company’s credit rating and market conditions any downgrade in the company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program and the credit facility and could limit or preclude the company’s ability to issue commercial paper if the company’s access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a downgrade change in market conditions or otherwise the company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash operating cash flow and the company’s credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the company’s credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

on june 17 2011 the company entered into a 30 billion 364day unsecured revolving credit facility the “364day facility” in connection with the acquisition of beckman coulter the company reduced the commitments under the 364day facility over the balance of the year and terminated the facility as of december 29 2011 there were no outstanding borrowings under the 364day facility at any time during the term of the facility

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2012  the company held 17 billion  of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 03 625 million of this amount was held within the united states and 11 billion was held outside of the united states the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures and acquisitions to pay interest and service debt pay taxes fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required repurchase shares of the company’s common stock pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions the company may also borrow under its commercial paper 

program or the credit facility enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program andor access the capital markets as needed the company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions with respect to the eurobond notes and the 2013 notes each of which matures in 2013 the company expects to repay the principal amounts when due under these notes using available cash proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper andor proceeds from other debt issuances 

while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws most of the companys foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the united states but under current law could be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits for most of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states a deferred tax liability has been accrued for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the united states no provisions for us income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states and the amount of us income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ if it repatriated these earnings the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions as of december 31 2012  and 2011  the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately 93 billion  and 78 billion  respectively as of december 31 2012  management believes that is has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states 

during 2012  the company contributed approximately 55 million  to its us defined benefit pension plan and approximately 53 million  to its nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2013  the company’s cash contribution requirements for its us defined benefit pension plan are not expected to be significant and the company’s cash contribution requirements for its nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 52 million  the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of offbalance sheet commitments of the company as of december 31 2012  

  



guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company’s obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company’s financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial statements 

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products or claims alleging that company products infringe thirdparty intellectual property the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual commitments table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding certain litigation matters 

in addition to the litigation matters noted under “item 1 business – regulatory matters – environmental health  safety” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices personal injury and insurance coverage the company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages based upon the company’s experience current information and applicable law it does not believe it is reasonably possible that these proceedings and claims will have a material effect on its financial statements 

while the company maintains general products property workers’ compensation automobile cargo aviation crime fiduciary and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions up to certain limits that cover certain of these claims this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses for general products and property liability and most other insured risks the company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the selfinsured retention in addition while the company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses 

in accordance with accounting guidance the company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued if a loss does not meet the known or probable level but is reasonably possible and a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed the companys reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk professionals where appropriate in addition outside risk professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including litigation developments the discovery of new facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy while the company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude if the company’s selfinsurance and litigation reserves prove inadequate it would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings please see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the amount of our accruals for selfinsurance and litigation liability

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the company’s trade accounts contract and finance receivable portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality the company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances while amounts recovered on accounts previously determined to be uncollectible increase the allowances if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required and net earnings would be adversely impacted 

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control as a result such fluctuations can be difficult to predict if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s financial statements 

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess research and development iprd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur the company does not amortize goodwill but does amortize certain identifiable intangible assets primarily customer relationships and acquired technology over the estimated useful life of the identified asset iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an indefinitelived intangible asset and is subject to annual impairment reviews or more often upon the occurrence of certain events when the iprd project is complete the asset is reclassified as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized over the assets estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned an impairment loss equal to the value of the intangible asset is recorded in the period of abandonment 

during 2012 accounting guidance became effective that simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment the guidance permits the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test alternatively the company may decide to proceed directly to the twostep goodwill impairment test the company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period for 2012  the company elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative impairment test for all reporting units as this was determined to be the most efficient method to assess for impairment across a large spectrum of reporting units 

on an annual basis the first day of the company’s fiscal fourth quarter the company quantitatively estimates the fair value of each of its reporting units and compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the company must perform additional analysis to determine if the reporting unit’s goodwill has been impaired if circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that there has been diminution of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value the company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event 

the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach the company estimates fair value based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units in addition to recent market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the company must perform additional analysis to determine if the reporting units goodwill has been impaired 

while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of december 31 2012  the company had twentyone  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from 7 million  to 39 billion  the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2012  indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 27 to approximately 804 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 15 to approximately 714 reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth 

contingent liabilities  as discussed above under “—legal proceedings” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed above under “—legal proceedings” if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

revenue recognition  the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services for revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition there must be persuasive evidence of a sale delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectability of the balance must be reasonably assured refer to note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies although most of the company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for sales recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for fiscal 2011 and future periods revenues for contractual arrangements consisting of multiple elements ie deliverables are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services that are part of the multiple element arrangement have value on a standalone basis and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy that in some instances may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold on a standalone basis or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable the company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements for transactions entered into prior to fiscal year 2011 revenue for multiple element arrangements was recognized for the separate elements when the product or services that are part of the multiple element arrangement had value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists or in the case of software related products vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element was considered probable and substantially in the company’s control a portion of the company’s revenues relate to lease payment arrangements which require the company to evaluate whether to account for the arrangement as an operating or sales type lease certain of the company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 

stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted including stock options restricted stock units “rsus” and restricted shares based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date for a description of the company’s stockbased compensation accounting practices refer to note 17 to the company’s consolidated financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent the company’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application 

of management judgment as a result if factors change and the company uses different assumptions the company’s equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest if the company’s actual forfeiture rate during a reporting period is materially different than its estimate the company’s earnings may be significantly impacted as the company records the effect of actual experience in the period it occurs 

pension and other postretirement benefits  certain of the company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans “pension plans” and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans “postretirement plans” the company measures its pension and post retirement plans’ assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan the company recognizes an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status in its balance sheet changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income accounting standards require that the amounts the company records including the expense or income associated with the pension and postretirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations for a description of the companys pension benefit accounting practices refer to notes 11 and 12 to the companys consolidated financial statements 

calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors upon the sale of the keo business during 2012 the danaher us defined benefit pension plan became fully frozen and plan participants are therefore no longer accruing benefits under this plan in connection with this triggering event the company updated the loss amortization period for actuarial gains and losses in the plan to record them over the remaining life expectancy of the plan participants rather than over the average future working lifetime of the plan participants as had been the case before the plan became fully frozen in addition the company updated the mortality assumptions used to estimate the projected benefit obligation to reflect updated mortality tables which extend the life expectancy of the participants the impact of these changes will reduce pension expense in 2013 by 29 million compared to what would have been recorded had these changes not been made while the company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate changes in the assumptions as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors the company’s financial statements could be materially impacted a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 158 million 99 million on an after tax basis and the nonus net obligation by 106 million 79 million on an after tax basis from the amounts recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2012  

for 2012  the expected longterm rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the us plan has been estimated at 750 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan targets to invest between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2012  was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2012  would have increased 12 million or 8 million on an aftertax basis the company intends to use an expected longterm rate of return assumption of 75 for 2013  for its us plan the company’s nonus plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 125  to 710  

for a discussion of the company’s 2012  and anticipated 2013  defined benefit pension plan contributions please see “—liquidity and capital resources—cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes  the company’s income tax expense represents the current tax liability for the year and the tax benefit or expense for the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the company’s tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the company’s consolidated statement of earnings for a description of the companys income tax accounting policies refer to note 1 to the companys consolidated financial statements the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies and can also be impacted by changes to tax laws deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on the 

company’s tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the company’s consolidated statements of earnings the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 

the company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when based upon the technical merits it is “morelikelythannot” that the position will be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company generally reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when i there is completion of tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 

an increase in our nominal tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012  of approximately 30 million

the following discussions of materials intellectual property competition seasonal nature of business working capital backlog employee relations research and development government contracts regulatory matters international operations and major customers include information common to all of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including steel copper cast iron electronic components aluminum plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas also affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no 

  

single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications there may be a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in our supply chain including in certain cases the use of alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2011 we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on our business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher or its subsidiaries 

competition 

although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the diversity of the products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality delivery speed service and support innovation distribution network breadth of product and service offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and endmarkets that they serve for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

  

backlog 

the table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our five segments at the end of 2011 and 2010  in millions 

 

 we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders as of december 31 2011 will be delivered to customers within 3 to 4 months of such date given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

employee relations 

at december 31 2011 we employed approximately 59000 persons of whom approximately 26000 were employed in the united states and approximately 33000 were employed outside of the united states of our united states employees approximately 1500 were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils for a discussion of risks related to employee relations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

research and development 

the table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate  in millions 

 

 we conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products enhancing the functionality effectiveness ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of our products are appropriate our research and development efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology the company conducts research and development activities on a businessbybusiness basis primarily in north america europe and asia we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position for a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” customersponsored research and development was not significant in 2011 2010 or 2009 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2011 was from customers other than governmental entities each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

  

regulatory matters 

we face comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

environmental laws and regulations 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with our operations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition to environmental compliance costs we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the current and former owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and nonus environmental agencies that conditions at certain sites where we and others previously disposed of hazardous wastes andor are or were property owners require cleanup and other possible remedial action including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal and state environmental laws we have projects underway at a number of current and former facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations remediation activities generally relate to soil andor groundwater contamination and may include preremedial activities such as factfinding and investigation risk assessment feasibility study andor design as well as remediation actions such as contaminant removal monitoring andor installation operation and maintenance of longerterm remediation systems we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have made a provision for environmental investigation and remediation and environmentalrelated claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries and thirdparty sites where we have been determined to be a potentially responsible party we generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with similar sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations if we determine that potential liability for a particular site or with respect to a personal injury claim is probable and reasonably estimable we accrue the total estimated loss including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site or claim as of december 31 2011 the company had a reserve of 141 million for environmental matters which are probable and reasonably estimable of which 92 million are noncurrent which reflects the company’s best estimate of the costs to be incurred with respect to such matters please see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our environmental reserves 

all provisions have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future third party recoveries while we actively pursue insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude 

  

for a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical device and other healthcare regulations 

certain of our products are classified as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the united states to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the united states food and drug administration “fda” our medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries where our products are sold 

the fda’s regulatory requirements include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in the european union a single medical device regulatory approval process exists regulated products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality known as the “essential requirements” and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes unlike united states regulations which require virtually all devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the fda the eu regulations allow manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the essential requirements for that device certain products must go through a more formal premarket review process we are also required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use in a timely manner to the competent authorities of the european union countries a number of other countries including australia brazil canada china and japan have also adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for medical devices sold in those countries 

we are also subject to various laws regulating 1 fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and 2 the privacy and security of health information including the united states federal regulations described below many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to and in some cases more stringent than such federal regulations 

 

  

   

 in addition certain of our products utilize radioactive material and we are subject to federal state and local regulations governing the management storage handling and disposal of these materials for a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and the other regulatory regimes referenced above please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

exportimport compliance 

we are required to comply with various us exportimport control and economic sanctions laws including 

 

  

  

  

 other nations’ governments have implemented similar export and import control regulations which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

our products and services are available worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we also have operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that successfully target developing countries the table below describes annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate 

 

   

the table below describes longlived assets located outside the united states as a percentage of total longlived assets at the end of each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate including assets held for sale 

 

 for additional information related to revenues and longlived assets by country please refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and for information regarding deferred taxes by geography please refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

the manner in which our products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of our sales in nonus markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the united states though we also sell directly from the us into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors in countries with low sales volumes we generally sell through representatives and distributors 

financial information about our international operations is contained in note 20 of the consolidated financial statements and information about the possible effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of risks related to our nonus operations and foreign currency exchange please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

deterioration of or instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us during 2011 the global economy showed signs of recovering from the widespread recessionary conditions of 2008 and 2009 

  

which witnessed record levels of unemployment in some countries and extreme volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets however uncertainty remains as to the overall rate and sustainability of the recovery particularly in europe and we cannot assure you that we will not experience further recessionary conditions and other adverse effects from broad economic trends or that any improvements will be broadbased and will benefit the markets we serve the deterioration or instability of the economies and financial markets in the geographies in which we do business could adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in particular the european debt crisis and the instability and uncertainty relating to the euro could constrain government budgets limit the financing available to our suppliers and customers and adversely affect the economies and capital markets in europe and other geographies which could in turn adversely affect demand for our products the availability of supplies and the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations 

although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

the restructuring actions that we have taken to reduce costs could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in 2008 2009 and 2011 we implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses have the effect of reducing our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and technologies adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly as demand for our products increases these circumstances could adversely impact our financial statements 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses product demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities our product demand is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand decreased market share and price reductions for our products 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the diversity of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see “item 1 business – competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrate new markets including in developing countries our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements 

  

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new products and product enhancements on a timely basis our products will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims rules competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could cause us to incur significant legal fees and could damage our reputation 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and antitrust and other regulatory approvals and the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets in addition competition for acquisitions in our current and anticipated business areas is significant and may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies 

our acquisition of businesses including our acquisition of beckman coulter could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details in particular as of the date of this report the acquisition of beckman coulter inc in june 2011 

  

was danaher’s largest acquisition and has expanded danaher’s business into new markets our acquisitions involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated timeframe and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures may dilute the company’s earnings per share have other adverse accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the fda by comparable agencies of other countries and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials for more information regarding these regulations please see “item 1 – business – regulatory matters” we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory 

  

clearance such as 510k clearance for our new products or modifications to existing products within the anticipated timeframe or at all and if we do obtain such clearance it may be timeconsuming costly and restrictive our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances will depend on many factors including our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results and the process for obtaining such clearances could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained failure to obtain such regulatory clearances before marketing our products other violations of these regulations efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products injunctions administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions suspension or withdrawal of approvals and premarket notification rescissions 

as beckman coulter previously reported in its filings with the securities and exchange commission as a standalone company the business is addressing issues raised by the fda relating to its compliance and quality systems and product clearances for certain of its assays these matters have been the subject of form 483 inspectional observations and warning letters issued by the fda to certain of the business’ facilities although the obtaining of regulatory clearances and other resolutions with respect to these matters depends upon many factors and the timing thereof cannot be predicted with certainty the business is working diligently to address these issues we are also subject to various laws regulating 1 fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and 2 the privacy and security of health information including the federal regulations described in “item 1 – business – regulatory matters” many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to and in some cases more stringent than such federal regulations for more information regarding these regulations please see “item 1 – business – regulatory matters” 

failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation” compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses 

the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs which could adversely affect our financial statements 

the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs including the following 

 

  

  

 these changes may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products services from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services increase our tax liabilities and increase our compliance and other costs in addition we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability all of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements 

  

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the us and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2011 will have a material effect on our financial statements 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the anticorruption environmental health safety and fdarelated regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the federal state and local levels including the following 

 

  

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies damage to our reputation and loss of customers and could cause us to incur significant legal fees compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the iso and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” 

  

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 

at december 31 2011 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets totaled approximately 171 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services purchased overseas our sales and expenses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions please see the mda for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities due to the potential for changes to tax law and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services and intellectual property are complex and can also affect our tax liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements make estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and similar proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and similar proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31 2011 will have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects in including in products or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products that we make or sell can lead to personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 53 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition based on the availability under our credit facilities as of december 31 2011 we had the ability to incur an additional 15 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences including 1 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment 2 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 3 exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisitions 

  

our current revolving credit facility and longterm debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us for more information please refer to the mda if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition in addition any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance or purchasing patterns of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements  changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare could adversely impact our profitability 

we may incur higher costs to produce our products if commodity prices rise 

as discussed in “item 1 business – materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of raw materials prices for and availability of these raw materials have fluctuated significantly in the past due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher raw material costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changing market conditions or customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole sources of supply for certain materials and components could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our costs may increase conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity to reflect the demand for our products our profitability may suffer 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

  

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs privacy and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand for our products in addition the manner in which regulations and related regulatory deadlines impact demand for our products may be substantially different from period to period 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

international economic political legal and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2011 approximately 58 of our sales were derived from customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the us since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in emerging markets such as china india and brazil our international business and particularly our business in emerging markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

if we suffer loss to our facilities distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe attacks or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in addition attacks on our information technology systems and networks could result in the compromising of confidential information manipulation or destruction of data or improper use of our systems and networks if any of these facilities systems or networks were to experience a catastrophic loss or attack it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to these and other risks will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against losses 

  

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements 

we own a 50 interest in but do not control the apex tool group joint venture and as a result we may not be able to direct management of the joint venture in a manner that we believe is in danaher’s best interests 

in 2010 danaher and cooper industries plc formed a joint venture named apex tool group llc each company contributed its respective tools business to and received a 50 interest in the joint venture our joint venture partner may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture since we do not control the joint venture we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture in the manner that we believe is most appropriate in addition the joint venture agreement gives each party veto rights with respect to certain fundamental corporate actions and as a result we cannot assure you that we could effect certain fundamental corporate actions that we believe would be in danaher’s best interests any of these circumstances and any conflict that may arise between the parties could adversely impact our financial statements

general 

please see “item 1 business – general” for a discussion of danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations during 2011 approximately 58 of danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of its products and services typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results given the broad range of products manufactured services provided and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of the company’s geographic and industry diversity the company faces a variety of challenges and opportunities including rapid technological development in most of the company’s served markets the expansion of opportunities in emerging markets trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and consolidation of the company’s competitors the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and the company’s longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in highgrowth geographies and highgrowth product segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative new products and services with higher gross profit margins expand and improve the effectiveness of the company’s sales force and continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality the company is making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources particularly in emerging markets such as china india and brazil in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations 

business performance and outlook 

while differences exist among the company’s businesses on an overall basis demand for the company’s products and services increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 resulting in aggregate yearoveryear sales growth in addition the company’s previous investment in sales growth initiatives and the other businessspecific factors discussed below contributed to yearoveryear sales growth geographically yearoveryear sales growth rates during 2011 were led primarily by china and other emerging markets sales growth rates in developed markets were led by north america providing no significant deterioration in general economic conditions occurs the company expects sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a yearoveryear basis during 2012 but at a moderating rate from that experienced during 2011 particularly in the industrial technologies segment and to a lesser extent the test  measurement segment 

the acquisition of beckman coulter inc “beckman coulter” as discussed below provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company’s life sciences and diagnostics segment by expanding the businesses’ geographic and product line diversity including new and complementary product and service offerings in the areas of clinical diagnostics and life sciences research and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses as beckman coulter is integrated into the company the company also expects to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the danaher business system and the combined purchasing power of the company and beckman coulter for a discussion of the acquisition’s impact on the company and segment results please refer to the “results of operations” section of this mda

results of operations 

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 280 compared to 2010 sales from existing businesses increased 70 on a yearoveryear basis the impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 25 as the us dollar was on average weaker against other major currencies during 2011 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2010 the sales increase from acquired businesses more than offset the yearoveryear sales decline attributable to the 2010 contribution of businesses to the apex joint venture and on a net basis increased reported sales by 185 

in this report references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 1 sales from acquired businesses 2 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the apex joint venture and 3 the impact of currency translation references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses and 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the apex joint venture and b the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding sales from acquired businesses and 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the apex joint venture after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and excludes the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult the company excludes the effect of the 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the apex joint venture because the company did not recognize sales from those businesses in 2011 

operating profit margins were 163 for each of the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons benefited 160 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales marketing and product development growth investments the dilutive effect of acquisitions net of the favorable impact to operating profit margin of contributing certain businesses to the apex joint venture in july 2010 adversely impacted operating margin comparisons by 110 basis points in addition acquisition related charges associated with the beckman coulter acquisition including transaction costs change in control charges and fair value adjustments to acquisition related inventory and deferred revenue balances net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010 adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points 

  

operating profit margins were 163 in the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 137 for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in operating profit margins during 2010 is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities yearoveryear operating margin comparisons also benefited from approximately 160 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010 the favorable settlement of litigation with align technologies in the third quarter 2009 adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points the net dilutive effect of acquired businesses 2009 divestitures and the operating profit margin impact of contributing certain businesses to the apex joint venture in 2010 adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by approximately 65 basis points 2010 acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the company net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in 2009 also adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 35 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009 the company deems acquisitionrelated transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant generally relating to the company’s larger acquisitions if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisitionrelated transaction costs typical for the company in a given period

components of sales growth 

 

 2011 compared to 2010 

yearoveryear price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2011 

during 2011 sales in the segment’s instrument businesses grew on a yearoveryear basis due to increased demand for oscilloscopes and service and installation tools partially offset by yearoveryear declines in sales attributable to products serving the video end markets instrument sales grew in all major geographies during the year led by asia and other emerging markets instrument sales grew primarily during the first three quarters of 2011 as fourth quarter 2011 sales were essentially flat compared to 2010 sales of instruments are expected to continue to grow during 2012 on yearoveryear basis albeit at a rate lower than was experienced during 2011 

sales in the segment’s communications businesses also grew during 2011 on a yearoveryear basis primarily in north america as a result of strong demand for both network management solutions and core network enterprise solutions global demand for network security and analysis solutions was also robust in 2011 

operating profit margins increased 200 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010 yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons benefited 220 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales marketing and product development growth investments the dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 20 basis points 

2010 compared to 2009 

yearoveryear price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010 

during 2010 demand increased significantly for the business’ core instruments including oscilloscopes thermography products and digital multimeters sales were strong in all major geographies with particular strength in china in addition distributor inventory reductions that occurred in the first three quarters of 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions did not continue into 2010 which positively impacted the yearoveryear comparisons sales from existing businesses in the segment’s communications businesses grew at a low doubledigit rate during 2010 on a yearoveryear basis driven by strong demand for both network management solutions and core network enterprise solutions 

operating profit margins increased 660 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities yearoveryear operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 265 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 2010 acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances net of comparable acquisition related charges recorded in 2009 favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points as such charges were greater in 2009 than in 2010 the dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 130 basis points on yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons partially offsetting these favorable yearoveryear factors

 components of sales growth 

 

 2011 compared to 2010 

price increases in the segment contributed 15 to sales growth on a yearoveryear basis during 2011 as compared to 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a high singledigit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 strong demand during the first half of 2011 for the businesses’ laboratory and process instrumentation product lines in the municipal and industrial markets moderated slightly during the second half of 2011 while demand in the china municipal market increased on a yearoveryear basis during 2011 the rate of revenue growth for the year declined compared to the 2010 growth rate sales in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line grew at a low doubledigit rate on a yearoveryear basis as municipal markets returned to growth in the second half of the year and in particular during the fourth quarter after having declined in the first half of 2011 sales in the segment’s ultraviolet water treatment product line are expected to decline in the first quarter 2012 on a yearoveryear basis due in large part to a difficult prior year comparison resulting from strong industrial sales in the first quarter 2011 sales in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line also grew at a low doubledigit rate on a yearoveryear basis primarily due to the addition of new customers in the us market and to a lesser extent to continued international expansion 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s retailcommercial petroleum equipment businesses declined at a low singledigit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 the yearoveryear sales decline during the period is primarily attributable to 2010 performance dynamics the business generated strong sales of payment and pointofsale retail solutions product offerings in 2010 particularly the first half of 2010 driven by deadlines for compliance with enhanced industry security standards during 2011 increased demand for the business’ automatic tank gauge products and dispensing equipment in all major geographies resulted in yearoveryear sales growth that partially offset the unfavorable impact of the difficult prior year comparison 

operating profit margins increased 60 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010 yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons benefited 70 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales marketing and product development growth investments the dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 10 basis points 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

price increases in the segment contributed 05 to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a low doubledigit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 demand for the businesses’ laboratory and process instrumentation product lines was led by industrial markets and was stronger in all major geographies as compared to 2009 sales in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line grew at a high singledigit rate during 2010 solid yearoveryear growth in the product line’s industrial and residential applications was partially offset by a difficult prior year comparison associated with a significant drinking water treatment project that favorably impacted revenues throughout 2009 and into the first half of 2010 sales in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line also grew during 2010 as compared to 2009 due in part to continuing expansion of the chemical treatment solutions product line outside of the us market 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s retailcommercial petroleum equipment businesses grew at a low doubledigit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 strong north american demand during 2010 for the business’ payment and pointofsale retail solutions products was driven by enhanced industry security standards deadlines and contributed significantly to the yearoveryear sales growth demand for dispensing equipment also increased in all major geographic regions due to an increase in capital spending by customers sales declines in the business’ vapor recovery product offerings in north america primarily due to regulatory compliance deadlines in 2009 compared to 2010 partially offset these increases 

operating profit margins increased 110 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities yearoveryear operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 100 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 the dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 55 basis points on yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons partially offsetting these favorable yearoveryear factors incremental yearoveryear investments in 2010 compared to 2009 associated with the segment’s emerging market growth initiatives also negatively impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons

components of sales growth 

 

 2011 compared to 2010 

price increases in the segment contributed 05 to sales growth on a yearoveryear basis during 2011 as compared to 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

the significant growth related to acquisitions was primarily attributable to the acquisition of beckman coulter in june 2011 which significantly expanded the segment’s product and service offerings as further described below 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at a high singledigit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to continued strong consumable sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation and new instrument placements primarily in europe china and other asian markets demand for the business’ compact blood gas analyzer also remained strong particularly in emerging markets increased european and emerging market demand for the business’ cardiac care instruments also contributed to yearoveryear sales growth sales from existing businesses in the segment’s pathology diagnostics business also grew at a high singledigit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of increased demand for advanced staining instruments and consumables as well as higher sales of core histology systems and consumables primarily in north america and emerging markets and to a lesser extent europe the acquisition of beckman coulter has significantly expanded the segment’s product portfolio in the area of clinical diagnostics through the addition of new and complementary product and service offerings 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s microscopy businesses grew at a mid singledigit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of strong demand for confocal and compound instrumentation serving the life sciences research and industrial markets particularly in china and the emerging markets and to lesser extent europe a difficult prior year comparison resulting from first quarter 2010 sales associated with japanese economic stimulus funding partially reduced the reported sales growth for 2011 strong demand for the business’ broad range of mass spectrometers serving both the academic and proteomic research markets as well as the applied markets resulted in a low doubledigit growth rate from sales from existing businesses in the segment’s mass spectrometry business during 2011 as compared to 2010 sales from existing businesses in the mass spectrometry business grew in all major geographies during 2011 led by strong performance in the asia pacific region and north america and to a lesser extent europe the acquisition of beckman coulter has also expanded the segment’s product portfolio in the area of life sciences research through the addition of new and complementary product and service offerings 

operating profit margins decreased 120 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010 the dilutive effect of acquisitions primarily related to costs associated with beckman coulter’s restructuring and integration activities adversely impacted segment operating profit margins by 295 basis points acquisition related charges associated with the beckman coulter acquisition including transaction costs change in control charges and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue balances net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010 also adversely impacted operating profit margins by 95 basis points higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales marketing and product development growth investments favorably impacted yearoveryear comparisons by 270 basis points the company expects to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the danaher business system to beckman coulter and the combined purchasing power of the company and beckman coulter 

depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the beckman coulter acquisition in addition as a majority of the beckman coulter customers enter into operatingtype lease arrangements for the use of the business’ instrumentation depreciation expense increased on a yearoveryear basis depreciation and amortization expense in the segment is expected to continue to be higher than the segment’s historical depreciation and amortization expense levels for these same reasons 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

sales growth from acquisitions was primarily attributable to the acquisition of ab sciex and molecular devices in january 2010 yearoveryear price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at a high singledigit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to strong demand in all major geographies for a new version of the business’ compact blood gas analyzer increased european demand for the business’ cardiac care instruments as well as continued strong consumable sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation also contributed to yearoveryear sales growth 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses grew at a high singledigit rate during 2010 as compared 2009 yearoveryear growth was driven primarily by strong demand in all major geographies for new instruments and consumables in the pathology diagnostics business increased sales of compound and stereo microscopy equipment serving the life sciences research and industrial markets also contributed to the growth japanese economic stimulus funding also positively impacted 2010 sales as purchases were required to be completed by march 2010 in order to be eligible for japanese stimulus funding 

operating profit margins decreased 220 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009 acquisition related charges during 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances primarily related to the ab sciex and molecular devices acquisitions as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the company in each case net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in 2009 adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 270 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009 the net dilutive effect of acquired businesses had an adverse impact of 265 basis points on yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons the favorable impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 50 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts

price increases throughout the segment contributed 10 to sales growth on a yearoveryear basis during 2011 as compared to 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables businesses grew at a mid singledigit rate in 2011 driven primarily by increased demand for general dentistry consumables and orthodontic products and to a lesser extent infection control products sales in the dental consumables business grew in all major geographies sales from existing businesses in the segment’s dental equipment business grew on a yearoveryear basis at a mid singledigit rate due to strong imaging and instrument product demand increased sales of imaging products were led by north america and to lesser extent the emerging markets while instrument sales growth was driven largely by north america and europe 

operating profit margins increased 60 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010 higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements including cost reduction actions in the dental equipment businesses net of the impact of costs associated with various sales marketing and product development growth investments increased operating profit margin by 95 basis points on a yearoveryear basis the dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 35 basis points 

2010 compared to 2009 

price increases throughout the segment contributed 05 to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables businesses were essentially flat in 2010 as compared to 2009 robust demand for orthodontia products throughout 2010 in addition to increased sales of infection control products were offset by weak demand for general dentistry consumables primarily during the first three quarters of 2010 primarily as a result of adjustments to inventory levels in distribution channels that occurred during those periods demand in the general dentistry consumable businesses increased sequentially in the fourth quarter 2010 as inventories in the distribution channels returned to more normalized levels sales from existing businesses in the segment’s dental equipment businesses grew at a low doubledigit rate and increased in all major product categories during 2010 as compared to 2009 growth was led by increased sales in the imaging product lines as a result of strong demand for 3d equipment and a new digital xray sensor yearoveryear demand also increased for the business’ instruments and treatment units imaging product sales were particularly strong in north america and asia while instrument and treatment unit sales were particularly strong in europe 

operating profit margins decreased 190 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009 the decrease in operating profit margins was largely due to the favorable settlement of litigation with align technologies that occurred in 2009 and adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 515 basis points the dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 10 basis points on yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons the favorable impact of higher sales volumes during 2010 compared to 2009 cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 145 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts

 2011 compared to 2010 

price increases throughout the segment contributed 25 to sales growth on a yearoveryear basis during 2011 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a high singledigit rate on a yearoveryear basis during 2011 primarily due to continued strong demand for core marking and coding equipment consumable sales associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment also contributed to yearoveryear growth sales grew in all major geographies the 2011 acquisition of eskoartwork a leading full service solutions provider for the digital packaging and design and production market provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the segment by expanding the businesses’ product line diversity and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses grew at a high singledigit rate during 2011 sales growth rates declined in the second half of 2011 compared to growth rates in the first half of 2011 in part due to easier prior year comparisons in the first half of 2011 as well as the impact of slowing demand on a global basis in the second half of 2011 primarily in the technologyrelated and solar end markets yearoveryear sales increases in engineered solutions and linear and mechanical motion products during the second half of 2011 more than offset sales declines in industrial automation that occurred primarily in the fourth quarter 2011 sales grew in all major geographies yearoveryear sales are expected to decline in the first quarter 2012 due in part to softness in technologyrelated end markets and also due to anticipated lower demand for engineered solutions 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses grew collectively at a midteens rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 due to generally higher demand in the majority of endmarkets served 

operating profit margins increased 80 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010 yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons benefited 135 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements the net dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

price increases throughout the segment contributed 15 to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a midteens rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to increased demand for core marking and coding equipment as customers released capital spending that had been delayed from prior years strong consumable sales associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment also contributed to yearoveryear growth sales grew in all major geographies with particular strength in europe and the emerging markets 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses grew at a doubledigit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 as demand was strong in the majority of end markets served due primarily to the general economic recovery while growth was generally broadbased industrial automation led the growth with strong sales of advanced motor and drive product offerings sales increased in all major geographies 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses grew collectively at a highteens digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to generally higher demand in most major endmarkets 

operating profit margins increased 620 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in operating profit margins reflects the impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities yearoveryear operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 175 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 the divestiture of certain lower margin businesses and product lines in the fourth quarter 2009 in connection with the company’s restructuring activities also favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points 

cost of sales and gross profit 

 

 gross profit margins decreased 20 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010 the combination of the acquisition of beckman coulter which has lower overall gross profit margins than the company’s existing businesses and 35 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2011 compared to 2010 adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons in addition acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of beckman coulter net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010 relating primarily to the ab sciex molecular devices and certain other acquisitions adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points higher yearoveryear sales volumes and continued productivity improvements partially offset these adverse impacts the gross profit margin comparison also reflects the benefit of 65 basis points from the contribution to the apex joint venture at the beginning of the third quarter 2010 of certain of the company’s hand tools businesses which had lower average gross profit margins than the remainder of the company 

gross profit margins for 2010 increased 280 basis points from 2009 the yearoveryear increase reflects the impact of higher sales volumes as compared to 2009 yearoveryear cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 90 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010 gross profit margins during 2010 also benefited from the contribution to the apex joint venture at the beginning of the third quarter of certain of the company’s hand tools businesses acquisition related charges recorded in 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of ab sciex molecular devices and certain other acquisitions adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by approximately 30 basis points 

  

operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points on a yearoveryear basis for 2011 as compared to 2010 increased leverage of the company’s cost base resulting from higher sales volumes during 2011 was partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2011 compared to 2010 and continued investments in the company’s sales growth initiatives in addition change in control payments to beckman coulter employees in connection with the closing of the beckman coulter acquisition adversely impacted selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales during 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 90 basis points on a yearoveryear basis in 2010 as compared to 2009 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2010 reflects the benefit of increased leverage of the company’s cost base resulting from higher sales volumes during 2010 as compared to 2009 in addition to 70 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010 incremental yearoveryear investments in the company’s sales growth initiatives increased commission costs due to the higher sales volumes and the dilutive effect of certain recently acquired businesses and those businesses’ higher relative operating expense structures partially offset these yearoveryear improvements 

research and development expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points on a yearoveryear basis during 2011 recently acquired businesses with higher average research and development expenditures as well as continued investment in the company’s new product development initiatives primarily contributed to the increase the increase also reflects the contribution of most of the company’s hand tools businesses to the apex joint venture in the third quarter of 2010 as the contributed businesses had historically lower research and development spending as a percentage of sales relative to the overall company average 

research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased 50 basis points during 2010 on a yearoveryear basis the increase is primarily attributable to the contribution of the company’s hand tools businesses to the apex joint venture overall research and development costs also increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to recently acquired businesses primarily ab sciex and molecular devices with higher average research and development expenditures as well as continued investment in the company’s new product development initiatives

the impact on the company’s results of operations from 1 the contributed business prior to the formation of apex and 2 the company’s equity in the earnings of apex subsequent to the formation of apex is reflected in the table below  in millions 

 

 earnings from unconsolidated joint venture increased 44 million for 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to a full year of earnings in 2011 as compared to only six months of earnings in 2010 following the closing of the formation of the joint venture in july 2010 

interest costs 

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness please refer to “–liquidity and capital resources – financing activities and indebtedness” below 

interest expense of 142 million in 2011 was approximately 24 million higher than 2010 interest expense of 117 million the increase in interest expense during 2011 results primarily from the additional debt incurred during the second quarter of 2011 in connection with the beckman coulter acquisition the company’s average commercial paper borrowings were also higher in 2011 as compared to 2010 in large part due to borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition of beckman coulter interest expense in 2010 was essentially flat compared to interest expense in 2009 

interest income of 5 million 6 million and 5 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively was essentially flat on a yearoveryear basis 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s financial statements  the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states please refer to “—cash and cash requirements” below 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitation reserves are adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

  

yearoveryear changes in tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 was 209 229 and 180 respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate for each of 2011 2010 and 2009 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due principally to the company’s earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate in addition the effective tax rate in 2011 is lower than the us statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolution of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions as a result of a tax ruling court decision and lapse of certain tax statutes of limitations in addition to changes in estimates related to reserves associated with prior period uncertain tax positions these matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 240 basis points in 2011 

the effective tax rate of 229 in 2010 is also lower than the us federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations these matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 60 basis points in 2010 

the company’s 2009 effective tax rate of 180 is also lower than the us federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolution of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain tax statutes of limitations in addition to changes in estimates related to reserves associated with prior period uncertain tax positions these matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 730 basis points in 2009 

the effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be approximately 24 the anticipated increase from the 2011 rate is partially attributable to the research and experimentation credit that expired at the end of 2011 

inflation 

the effect of broad based inflation on the company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in the years ended december 31 2011 2010 or 2009 

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices each of which could impact its financial statements the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2011 an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock by approximately 162 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity 

as of december 31 2011 the company’s variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar commercial paper borrowings and to a lesser extent floating rate senior notes due 2013 as a result the company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances 

  

as of december 31 2011 as these shorter duration obligations mature the company anticipates issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2011 a 150 increase in average market interest rates on the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 2 million a 150 hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2011 in 2011 a 65 increase in average market interest rates on the company’s 300 million floating rate senior notes due 2013 would have increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 1 million a 65 hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company’s actual coupon interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2011 

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries the eurobond notes described below provide a natural hedge to a portion of the company’s european net asset position the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries net of the translation effect of the company’s eurobond notes is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at december 31 2011 net of the translation effect of the company’s eurobond notes would result in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 584 million 

the company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred and sales are generated in foreign currencies costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively 

currency exchange rates increased reported 2011 sales by 25 on a yearoveryear basis as the us dollar was on average slightly weaker against other major currencies during 2011 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2010 the impact on reported sales due to the strengthening of the us dollar in the fourth quarter 2011 was more than offset by the impact of the us dollar’s weakness against other major currencies during the first three quarters of 2011 

as a result of the recent strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2011 prevail throughout 2012 currency exchange rates would negatively impact 2012 reported sales by approximately 20 relative to the company’s performance in 2011 additional strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would have a further negative impact on the company’s reported sales and results of operations any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the acquisition of beckman coulter the company acquired an existing currency swap agreement the agreement requires the company to purchase approximately 184 million japanese yen jpy¥ at a rate of 1  ¥10225 on a monthly basis through june 1 2018 as of december 31 2011 the aggregate japanese yen purchase commitment was approximately ¥141 billion approximately 182 million based on exchange rates as of december 31 2011 the currency swap does not qualify for hedge accounting and as a result changes in the fair value of the currency swap are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings during the year ended december 31 2011 the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately 8 million related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap 

  

credit risk 

the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments receivables from customers and derivatives the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents the company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and only with highquality financial institutions and limits its exposure at any one institution 

equity price risk 

the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities a 10 decline in the value of these equity securities as of december 31 2011 would have reduced the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio by approximately 29 million 

commodity price risk

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses consummating strategic acquisitions paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis

 operating activities

 the 2011 financing notes the eurobond notes the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes are collectively referred to as the “notes” 

commercial paper program and credit facility 

the company primarily satisfies any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flow and available cash through issuances of commercial paper under its us and euro commercial paper programs under these programs the company or a subsidiary of the company as applicable may issue and sell unsecured shortterm promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 25 billion interest expense on the notes is paid at maturity and is generally based on the ratings assigned to the company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to libor borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions during 2011 the company issued commercial paper under its us program to fund a portion of the purchase price for beckman coulter and the retirement of substantially all of the beckman coulter debt see below as of december 31 2011 borrowings outstanding under the company’s us commercial paper program had a weighted average interest rate of 02 and a weighted average maturity of approximately 30 days commercial paper balances during the year carried interest at rates ranging between 01 and 02 and original maturities between 1 and 67 days there was no commercial paper outstanding under the euro program as of december 31 2011 or at any other time during 2011 the company classified its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs at december 31 2011 as longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet as the company had the intent and ability as supported by availability under the credit facility referenced below to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date 

  

credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by a 25 billion unsecured multiyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on july 15 2016 the “credit facility” the credit facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes under the credit facility borrowings other than bid loans bear interest at a rate equal to at the company’s option either 1 a liborbased rate plus a margin that varies according to the company’s longterm debt credit rating the “eurodollar rate” or 2 the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 12 of 1 b the prime rate and c the eurodollar rate plus 1 plus in each case a margin that varies according to the company’s longterm debt credit rating under the credit facility in addition to certain initial fees the company is obligated to pay a per annum commitment fee that varies according to its longterm debt credit rating the credit facility requires the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the facility of 065 to 100 or less and also contains customary representations warranties conditions precedent events of default indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants as of december 31 2011 no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility in addition to the credit facility the company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit 

the availability of the credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the company’s commercial paper program the company expects to limit any borrowings under the credit facility to amounts that would provide sufficient credit available under the facility to allow the company to borrow if needed to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the company’s ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of the company’s credit rating and market conditions any downgrade in the company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program and the credit facility and could limit or preclude the company’s ability to issue commercial paper if the company’s access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise the company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash operating cash flow and the company’s credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the company’s credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

on june 17 2011 the company entered into a 30 billion 364day unsecured revolving credit facility the “364day facility” in connection with the acquisition of beckman coulter the company reduced the commitments under the 364day facility from 30 billion to 22 billion effective as of june 27 2011 from 22 billion to 15 billion effective as of july 21 2011 from 15 billion to 10 billion effective as of october 1 2011 and terminated the facility as of december 29 2011 there were no outstanding borrowings under the 364day facility at any time during the term of the facility

while the company maintains general products property workers’ compensation automobile cargo aviation crime fiduciary and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions up to certain limits that cover certain of these claims this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses for general and products liability and most other insured risks the company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the selfinsured retention in addition while the company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses 

the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable the company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters as well as amounts or ranges of probable losses and if appropriate recognizes a reserve for these contingencies these reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk insurance professionals where appropriate in addition outside risk insurance professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including litigation developments the discovery of new facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy while the company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude if the company’s selfinsurance and litigation reserves prove inadequate it would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings please see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the amount of our accruals for selfinsurance and litigation liability

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the company’s trade accounts contract and finance receivable portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality the company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances while amounts recovered on accounts previously determined to be uncollectible increase the allowances if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required and net earnings would be adversely impacted 

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control as a result such fluctuations can be difficult to predict if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur the company does not amortize goodwill but does amortize certain identifiable intangible assets primarily customer relationships and acquired technology over the estimated useful life of the identified asset on an annual basis the first day of the company’s fiscal fourth quarter the company estimates the fair value of each of its reporting units and compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the company must perform additional analysis to determine if the reporting unit’s goodwill has been impaired if circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that there has been diminution of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value the company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach the company estimates fair value based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units in addition to market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach once completed the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and 

  

terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of december 31 2011 the company had 28 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from approximately 7 million to approximately 37 billion the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2011 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 11 to approximately 560 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately zero to approximately 494 reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth 

contingent liabilities as discussed above under “—legal proceedings” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed above under “—legal proceedings” if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

revenue recognition  the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services for revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition there must be persuasive evidence of a sale delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectability of the balance must be reasonably assured refer to note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies although most of the company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for sales recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for fiscal 2011 and future periods revenues for contractual arrangements consisting of multiple elements ie deliverables are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services that are part of the multiple element arrangement have value on a standalone basis and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy that in some instances may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold on a standalone basis or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable the company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements for transactions entered into prior to fiscal year 2011 revenue for arrangements with multiple elements is recognized for the separate elements when the product or services that are part of the multiple element arrangement have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists or in the case of software related products vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control a portion of the company’s revenues relate to lease payment arrangements which require the company to evaluate whether to account for the arrangement as an operating or sales type lease certain of the company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 

  

stockbased compensation the company accounts for stockbased compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted including stock options restricted stock units “rsus” and restricted shares based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date for a discussion of the company’s stockbased compensation accounting practices refer note 17 to the company’s consolidated financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent the company’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and the company uses different assumptions the company’s equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest if the company’s actual forfeiture rate during a reporting period is materially different than its estimate the company’s earnings may be significantly impacted as the company records the effect of actual experience in the period it occurs 

pension and other postretirement benefits certain of the company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans “pension plans” and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans “postretirement plans” the company measures its pension and post retirement plans’ assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan the company recognizes an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status in its balance sheet changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income accounting standards require that the amounts the company records including the expense or income associated with the pension and postretirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations 

calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors while the company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate changes in the assumptions as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors may affect the company’s financial position or results of operations a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the us net obligation by 125 million 78 million on an after tax basis and the nonus net obligation by 77 million 58 million on an after tax basis from the amounts recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2011 

for 2011 the expected longterm rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the us plan has been estimated at 8 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan targets to invest between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2011 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense for the us and nonus plans for 2011 would have increased 8 million or 5 million on an aftertax basis the company intends to use an expected longterm rate of return assumption of 75 for 2012 for its us plan the company’s nonus plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 125 to 790

income taxes the company’s income tax expense represents the current tax liability for the year and the tax benefit or expense for the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the company’s tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the 

  

impact of tax planning strategies and can also be impacted by changes to tax laws deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on the company’s tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the company’s consolidated statements of earnings the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 

the company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when based upon the technical merits it is “morelikelythannot” that the position will be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company generally reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when i there is completion of tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 

an increase in our nominal tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 of approximately 25 million

the following discussions of materials intellectual property competition seasonal nature of business working capital backlog employee relations research and development government contracts regulatory matters international operations and major customers include information common to all of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including steel copper cast iron electronic components aluminum plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas also affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications there may be a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in our supply chain including the use of alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2010 we had no raw material shortages that had a material adverse effect on our business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher or its subsidiaries 

competition 

although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the diversity of the products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality delivery speed service and support innovation distribution network breadth of product and service offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

  

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and endmarkets that they serve for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products and sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

backlog 

the table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our five segments at the end of 2010 and 2009  in millions 

 

 we expect that a large majority of these unfilled orders will be delivered to customers within 3 to 4 months given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm performance 

employee relations 

at december 31 2010 we employed approximately 48200 persons of whom approximately 21400 were employed in the united states and approximately 26800 were employed outside of the united states of our united states employees approximately 1560 were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils for a discussion of risks related to employee relations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

research and development 

the table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate  in millions 

 

   

we conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products enhancing the functionality effectiveness ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of our products are appropriate our research and development efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology the company conducts research and development activities on a businessbybusiness basis primarily in north america europe and asia we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position for a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” customersponsored research and development was not significant in 2010 2009 or 2008 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2010 was from customers other than governmental entities we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense motion test  measurement life sciences  diagnostics water quality product identification and sensors and controls businesses as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

we face comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to 

environmental laws and regulations 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with our operations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition to environmental compliance costs we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the current and former owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and nonus environmental agencies that conditions at certain sites where we and others previously disposed of hazardous wastes andor are or were property owners require cleanup and other possible remedial action including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal and state environmental laws we have projects underway at a number of current and former facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations remediation activities generally involve soil andor groundwater contamination and may include preremedial activities such as factfinding and investigation risk assessment feasibility study andor design as well as remediation actions such as contaminant removal monitoring andor installation operation and maintenance of longerterm remediation systems we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

  

we have made a provision for environmental investigation and remediation and environmentalrelated claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries and thirdparty sites where we have been determined to be a potentially responsible party refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the amount of our environmental provisions we generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with similar sites if we determine that potential liability for a particular site or with respect to a personal injury claim is probable and reasonably estimable we accrue the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site or claim while we actively pursue insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude 

the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations all provisions have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future third party recoveries for the reasons described above we cannot assure you that our estimates of environmental liabilities will not change 

in view of our financial position and provisions for environmental remediation matters and other environmentalrelated claims and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect we believe that our liability related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow for a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical devices 

certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration the “fda” and by the comparable agencies of the nonus countries where our products are sold some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the united states 

pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fda regulates virtually all phases of the development manufacture sale and distribution of medical devices including their introduction into interstate commerce manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping pursuant to the fdca and fda regulations certain facilities of our operating subsidiaries are registered with the fda as medical device manufacturing establishments the fda as well as industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization “iso” regularly inspect our registered andor certified facilities 

we sell both class i and class ii medical devices a medical device whether exempt from or cleared pursuant to the premarket notification requirements of the fdca or approved pursuant to a premarket approval application is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the fda to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements including but not limited to product labeling requirements and limitations including those related to promotion and marketing efforts quality system requirements and medical device adverse event reporting certain of our products utilize radioactive material and we are subject to federal state and local regulations governing the management storage handling and disposal of these materials in addition we are subject to various federal state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry including antikickback and false claims laws for a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and other regulatory regimes referenced above please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

exportimport compliance 

we are required to comply with various us exportimport control and economic sanctions laws including 

 

   

  

  

 other nations’ governments have implemented similar export and import control regulations which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

our products and services are available worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we also have operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that successfully target developing countries the table below describes annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate 

 

 the table below describes longlived assets located outside the united states as a percentage of total longlived assets at the end of each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate 

 

   

for additional information related to revenues and longlived assets by country please refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and for information regarding deferred taxes by geography please refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the manner in which our products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of our sales in nonus markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the united states though we also sell directly from the us into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors in countries with low sales volumes we generally sell through representatives and distributors 

financial information about our international operations is contained in note 19 of the consolidated financial statements and information about the possible effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of risks related to our nonus operations and foreign currency exchange please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as us and nonus economic and financial market conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us the global economic turmoil that began in 2008 continued through 2009 involving widespread recessionary conditions record levels of unemployment in some countries and volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets during 2010 the company began to see signs of an economic recovery in many markets however we cannot assure you that these improvements will be broadbased and sustainable and will benefit all of the markets we serve or that we will not experience further adverse effects from broad economic trends instability in the global economy and financial markets can adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets through the date of this report if conditions in the financial markets worsen there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations in addition the failure of one of more of the syndicate members in our credit facilities could reduce the availability of credit and harm our liquidity 

the restructuring actions that we have taken to reduce costs could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in 2008 and 2009 we implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities have the effect of reducing our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and technologies adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly as demand for our products increases these circumstances could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses product demand depends on the customer’s capital spending budget as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may face decreased demand decreased market share or price reductions for our products 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and that in many cases have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see “item 1 business – competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product categories and penetrate new markets including in developing countries our failure to compete effectively may adversely affect our revenues profitability and cash flow and pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis our products will become obsolete over time and our revenues cash flow profitability and competitive position will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the need for regulatory including antitrust approvals and the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets in addition competition for acquisitions in our business areas is significant and may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions our ability to grow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings 

our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see the section titled “liquidity and capital resources – investing activities” in the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details our acquisitions involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our profitability and return on invested capital 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

divestitures could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business including potentially dilutive impacts on the company’s earnings per share and other accounting impacts potential disputes with buyers and distraction of management in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 

at december 31 2010 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets totaled approximately 122 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair these assets any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services purchased overseas our sales and expenses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims rules competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits and could damage our reputation 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions please see the section titled “income taxes” in the mda for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and 

  

decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities due to the ambiguity of tax laws and the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 

the obama administration has announced proposals to tax profits of us companies earned abroad while it is not possible for us to predict whether any such proposals will be implemented or how they will ultimately impact us they may adversely impact our results of operations 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our operations the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations 

we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position revenues profitability and cash flows even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisitionrelated matters these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition operations and results of operations moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us 

  

against such losses in addition developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements make estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the us and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will be at all times effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

manufacturing or design defects including in components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us recalls and product liability claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the environmental health and safety regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the federal state and local levels including the following 

 

  

   

  

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to manufacture import and export products and services disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and damage to our reputation compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the iso and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 28 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition based on the credit support provided by our credit facilities as of december 31 2010 we had the ability to incur an additional 135 billion of indebtedness under our outstanding commercial paper facilities our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

  

  

 we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly in connection with acquisitions if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

our current revolving credit facilities and longterm debt obligations impose certain restrictions on us for more information please refer to the mda if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

  

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur higher costs to produce our products if commodity prices rise 

as discussed in “item 1 business – materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of raw materials prices for these raw materials have fluctuated significantly in the past due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to fully pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher raw material costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changing market conditions or customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole sources of supply for certain materials and components could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our costs may increase conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity to reflect the demand for our products our profitability may suffer 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment food and drugs and electronic communications we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect our growth rate in addition the manner in which regulations and related deadlines impact demand for our products may be substantially different from period to period 

  

we may be unable to adjust to changes in the healthcare industry some of which could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs these changes include the recently enacted us legislation on healthcare reform healthcare austerity measures in europe wider implementation of managed care consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates some of these potential changes may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors reduce the volume of medical procedures or impose excise taxes on medical device companies these changes could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance or purchasing patterns of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare could adversely impact our profitability 

international economic political legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in 2010 approximately 55 of our sales were derived from customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the us since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in emerging markets our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and growth 

  

if we suffer loss to our facilities distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to these and other risks will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against losses 

we own a 50 interest in but do not control the apex tool group joint venture and as a result we may not be able to direct management of the joint venture in a manner that we believe is in danaher’s best interests 

in 2010 danaher and cooper industries plc formed a joint venture named apex tool group llc each company contributed its respective tools business to and received a 50 interest in the joint venture our joint venture partner may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture since we do not control the joint venture we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture in the manner that we believe is most appropriate in addition the joint venture agreement gives each party veto rights with respect to certain fundamental corporate actions and as a result we cannot assure you that we could effect certain fundamental corporate actions that we believe would be in danaher’s best interests any of these circumstances and any conflict that may arise between the parties could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is designed to provide a reader of danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of company management the company’s mda is divided into four main sections 

 

  

  

  

 overview 

general 

please see “item 1 business – general” for a discussion of danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations during 2010 approximately 55 of danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors for example in those industry segments where the company is a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the company’s customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of its products and services typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of challenges and opportunities including rapid technological development in most of our served markets the expansion of opportunities in emerging markets trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and consolidation of our competitors we operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and our longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business including through geographical and product line expansion identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative new products and services with higher gross profit margins expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force and continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality we are making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address the rapid pace of technological change in our served markets and to globalize our manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources particularly in emerging markets such as china india and brazil in order to improve the efficiency of our operations and be responsive to our customers throughout the world 

business performance and outlook 

while differences exist among the company’s businesses on an overall basis demand for the company’s products and services increased substantially in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulting in aggregate yearoveryear sales growth the growth in sales is due in part to the stabilization in global economic conditions that began in the fourth quarter 2009 easier yearoveryear comparisons resulting from the recessionary economic conditions that prevailed during most of 2009 investments made in sales growth initiatives and other businessspecific factors discussed below yearoveryear sales growth rates during 2010 were led by emerging markets with particular strength in china north america and europe also grew on a yearoveryear basis but at a lesser rate than the emerging markets providing no significant deterioration in general economic conditions occurs the company expects sales to continue to grow on a yearoveryear basis during 2011 but at a moderating rate from that experienced during 2010 due primarily to more difficult yearoveryear comparisons

results of operations

operating profit margins were 164 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 138 for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in operating profit margins reflects the impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities yearoveryear operating margin comparisons also benefited from approximately 160 basis points of incremental restructuring costs 

  

incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010 the favorable settlement of litigation with align technologies in the third quarter 2009 adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points the net dilutive effect of acquired businesses 2009 divestitures and the operating profit margin impact of contributing certain businesses to the apex joint venture adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by approximately 65 basis points acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the company net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in the comparable period of 2009 also adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 35 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009 

operating profit margins were 138 in the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 147 for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in operating profit margins during 2009 is primarily a result of lower sales volumes in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the level incurred during 2008 which reduced operating profit margin comparisons by 115 basis points on a yearoveryear basis in addition the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 20 basis points on yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins the gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the align litigation settlement also favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points in addition accounting charges recorded in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the november 2007 acquisition of tektronix net of comparable acquisitionrelated charges recorded in 2009 favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 10 basis points as such charges were greater in 2008 than 2009

 2010 compared to 2009 

during 2010 demand increased significantly for the business’ core instruments including oscilloscopes thermography products and digital multimeters sales were strong in all major geographies with particular strength in china in addition distributor inventory reductions that occurred in the first three quarters of 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions did not continue into 2010 which positively impacted the yearoveryear comparisons sales from existing businesses in the segment’s network and communication businesses grew at a low doubledigit rate during 2010 on a yearoveryear basis driven by strong demand for both network management solutions and core network enterprise solutions yearoveryear price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010 

operating profit margins increased 660 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities yearoveryear operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 265 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances net of comparable acquisition related charges recorded in 2009 favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points as such charges were greater in 2009 than in 2010 the dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 130 basis points on yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons partially offsetting these favorable yearoveryear factors 

2009 compared to 2008 

soft demand across all instrumentation related product lines attributable to general economic conditions and inventory reductions by distributors drove sales declines from existing businesses during 2009 yearoveryear price increases of 15 partially offset the sales decline during 2009 while yearoveryear sales declined during each quarter during 2009 the rate of decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year primarily due to the adverse impact of inventory level reductions in the distribution channel that were largely completed by the end of the third quarter yearoveryear comparisons for the fourth quarter were also 

  

favorably impacted by the decline in demand that commenced in the fourth quarter 2008 resulting in an easier comparison sales declined in all significant geographic regions yearoveryear sales in the network and communication businesses declined at a lower rate than the instrumentation business primarily as a result of positive performance in the network management solutions businesses which benefited from the competition among mobile telecommunication providers to expand coverage services and performance of their networks 

operating profit margins decreased 390 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009 as well as 230 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008 the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses also adversely impacted operating profit margins on a yearoveryear basis by 35 basis points accounting charges incurred in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the november 2007 acquisition of tektronix net of comparable acquisitionrelated charges recorded in 2009 favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 120 basis points cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses also partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins

 2010 compared to 2009 

sales grew during 2010 as compared to 2009 in both the water quality and retail petroleum equipment businesses price increases in the segment contributed 05 to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

  

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a low doubledigit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 demand for the businesses’ laboratory and process instrumentation product lines was led by industrial markets and was stronger in all major geographies as compared to 2009 sales in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line grew at a highsingle digit rate during 2010 solid yearoveryear growth in the product line’s industrial and residential applications was partially offset by a difficult prior year comparison associated with a significant drinking water treatment project that favorably impacted revenues throughout 2009 and into the first half of 2010 despite the difficult yearoveryear comparison underlying demand in the product line’s municipal markets remains robust sales in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line also grew during 2010 as compared to 2009 due in part to continuing expansion of the chemical treatment solutions product line outside of the us market 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s retail petroleum equipment businesses grew at a low doubledigit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 strong north american demand during 2010 for the business’ payment and pointofsale retail solutions products was driven by enhanced industry standards deadlines and contributed significantly to the yearoveryear sales growth demand for dispensing equipment also increased in all major geographic regions due to an increase in capital spending by customers the business’ growth rate is expected to moderate in 2011 compared to 2010 as north american demand for payment and pointofsale products is expected to moderate following the 2010 deadlines referenced above sales declines in the business’ vapor recovery product offerings in north america primarily due to regulatory compliance deadlines in 2009 compared to 2010 partially offset these increases 

operating profit margins increased 110 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities yearoveryear operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 100 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 the dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 55 basis points on yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons partially offsetting these favorable yearoveryear factors incremental yearoveryear investments in 2010 associated with the segment’s emerging market growth initiatives also negatively impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons 

2009 compared to 2008 

sales in the water quality businesses during 2009 were essentially flat on a yearoveryear basis while sales in the retail petroleum equipment businesses declined as compared to 2008 price increases in the segment contributed 15 to sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses during 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008 a midteens growth rate in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line and a midsingle digit growth rate in the chemical treatment solutions product line along with yearoveryear price increases of 20 offset lowsingle digit sales declines in the business’ laboratory and process instrumentation product line growth rates in the ultraviolet water treatment product line reflected strength in demand for municipal wastewater applications as well as shipments related to a significant drinking water treatment plant project that commenced in 2009 in the business’ laboratory and process instrumentation and consumable product line general economic conditions adversely impacted demand in all major geographies with the exception of china where revenues grew at a low doubledigit rate during 2009 

sales from existing businesses in the retail petroleum equipment business during 2009 declined at a lowsingle digit rate as compared to 2008 strong north american sales of the business’ pointofsale retail and payment solution product offerings that were driven in part by regulatory requirements were more than offset by lower demand for dispensing equipment primarily in europe and service offerings lower demand for the business’ automatic tank gauge product offerings and leak detection systems also adversely impacted yearoveryear comparisons the decline in demand for the business’ leak detection systems was partially attributable to a significant project in 2008 that did not repeat in 2009 

operating profit margins decreased 30 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes from existing businesses during 2009 as well as 45 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008 the dilutive effect of recently acquired 

  

businesses also adversely impacted operating profit margins on a yearoveryear basis by 50 basis points cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins

 2010 compared to 2009 

during 2010 sales from existing businesses grew in each of the segment’s businesses sales growth from acquisitions was primarily attributable to the acquisition of absciex and molecular devices in january 2010 yearoveryear price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at a high singledigit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to strong demand in all major geographies for a new version of the business’ compact blood gas analyzer increased european demand for the business’ cardiac care instruments as well as continued strong consumable sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation also contributed to yearoveryear sales growth 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses grew at a high singledigit rate during 2010 as compared 2009 yearoveryear growth was driven primarily by strong demand in all major geographies for new instruments and consumables in the pathology diagnostics business increased sales of compound and stereo microscopy equipment serving the life sciences research and industrial markets also contributed to the growth japanese economic stimulus funding also positively impacted 2010 sales as purchases were required to be completed by march 2010 in order to be eligible for japanese stimulus funding 

  

operating profit margins decreased 220 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009 acquisition related charges during 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances primarily related to the ab sciex and molecular devices acquisitions as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the company in each case net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in the comparable period of 2009 adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 270 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009 the dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 265 basis points on yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons the favorable impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 50 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts 

2009 compared to 2008 

during 2009 sales growth in the segment’s acute care diagnostic and pathology diagnostic businesses was largely offset by sales declines in the segment’s life sciences instrumentation businesses price increases contributed 15 sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the acute care diagnostics business grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008 continued strong aftermarket consumables sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation drove the majority of the growth during 2009 increased sales of the business’ cardiac marking instrument also contributed to the yearoveryear growth sales grew at a doubledigit rate in china and the emerging economies of latin america during 2009 while combined europe and north america sales were flat 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s life science instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008 sales growth attributable to pathology diagnostic instrumentation and associated consumable products primarily outside of north america was more than offset by sales declines attributable to lower demand for compound and stereo microscopy equipment primarily in europe and north america lower demand for microscopy equipment resulted largely from lower capital spending in the company’s customer base throughout 2009 while yearoveryear sales in the life sciences instrumentation business declined in each quarter during 2009 the rate of yearoveryear decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year as economic stimulus funding primarily in japan began to favorably impact the business 

operating profit margins declined 90 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008 restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the levels incurred during 2008 reduced operating profit margins by 65 basis points on a yearoveryear basis and the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 5 basis points the impact of the new business combination accounting standard requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after december 31 2008 also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 100 basis points while the yearoveryear sales declines diminished leverage of the segment’s fixed cost base the 2009 cost savings attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses offset this adverse impact

 2010 compared to 2009 

price increases throughout the segment contributed 05 to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s dental technologies businesses grew at a low doubledigit rate and increased in all major product categories during 2010 as compared to 2009 growth was led by increased sales in the imaging product lines as a result of strong demand for 3d equipment and a recently introduced digital xray sensor yearoveryear demand also increased for the business’ instruments and treatment units imaging product sales were particularly strong in north america and asia while instrument and treatment unit sales were particularly strong in europe sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables businesses were essentially flat in 2010 as compared to 2009 robust demand for orthodontia products throughout 2010 in addition to increased sales of infection control products were offset by weak demand for general dentistry consumables primarily during the first three quarters of 2010 primarily as a result of adjustments to inventory levels in distribution channels that occurred during those periods demand in the general dentistry consumable businesses increased sequentially in the fourth quarter 2010 as inventories in the distribution channels returned to more normalized levels 

operating profit margins decreased 190 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009 the decrease in operating profit margins is largely due to the favorable settlement of litigation with align technologies that occurred in 2009 and adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 515 basis points the dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 10 basis points on yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons the favorable impact of higher sales volumes during 2010 compared to 2009 cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 145 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts 

2009 compared to 2008 

price increases contributed 10 sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

  

sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables business in 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008 increased sales of orthodontia and infection control products during 2009 were offset by weaker demand for implants endodontic products and general dentistry consumables lower capital spending by customers and inventory reductions in certain distribution channels drove yearoveryear sales declines at a midteen rate in the dental technologies businesses while yearoveryear sales in the dental technologies business declined in each quarter during 2009 the rate of yearoveryear decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year due to strong sales of treatment units in europe as well as easier yearoveryear comparisons due to a large stocking order for imaging equipment that occurred in the third quarter 2008 

operating profit margins increased 310 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008 the gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the align litigation settlement favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 515 basis points restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the levels incurred during 2008 reduced operating profit margins by 140 basis points on a yearoveryear basis and the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 20 basis points the impact of the new business combination accounting standard requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after december 31 2008 also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 20 basis points while the yearoveryear sales declines diminished leverage of the segment’s fixed cost base the 2009 cost savings attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset this adverse impact

2010 compared to 2009 

price increases throughout the segment contributed 15 to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a midteens rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to increased demand for core marking and coding equipment as customers released capital spending that had been delayed from prior years strong consumable sales associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment also contributed to yearoveryear growth sales grew in all major geographies with particular strength in europe and the emerging markets 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses grew at a doubledigit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 as demand was strong in the majority of end markets served due primarily to the general economic recovery while growth was generally broadbased industrial automation led the growth with strong sales of advanced motor and drive product offerings sales increased in all major geographies 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses grew collectively at a highsingle digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to generally higher demand in most major endmarkets demand increased in the segment’s sensors and controls businesses and engineretarder business during 2010 sales in the aerospace and defense businesses were essentially flat compared to 2009 as the aerospace end markets did not begin to recover from the recession until the second half of 2010 

operating profit margins increased 540 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in operating profit margins reflects the impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities yearoveryear operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 175 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 the divestiture of certain lower margin businesses and product lines in the fourth quarter 2009 in connection with the company’s restructuring activities also favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 40 basis points 

2009 compared to 2008 

sales declines in a majority of the segment’s businesses during 2009 more than offset sales growth of approximately 15 related to price increases which are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses declined at a high single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008 sales declines during 2009 resulted primarily from weak demand for core marking and coding equipment due to lower capital spending by customers as a result of general economic conditions sales of consumable products associated with the businesses’ installed base of marking and coding equipment also declined on a yearoveryear basis but not as significantly as equipment sales during the fourth quarter of 2009 equipment sales increased on a yearoveryear basis primarily due to emerging market growth flat consumable product sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 were an improvement compared to yearoveryear consumable sales declines during the first three quarters of the year sales in the china market grew during the second half of 2009 resulting in lowsingle digit sales growth for the full year 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses declined at double digit rates during 2009 as compared to 2008 sales declined as a result of weak demand for most of the businesses’ product offerings attributable to the recessionary economic conditions that existed throughout 2009 while yearoveryear sales in the motion businesses declined in each quarter during 2009 the rate of yearoveryear decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved slightly compared to the second and third quarters of the year due to improvements in demand for certain product offerings and the absence of inventory reductions experienced in early 2009 in the business’ distribution channels 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses declined at a lowdouble digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008 the company’s sensors and controls business saw modest improvement in certain end markets during the fourth quarter 2009 as compared to the first nine months of 2009 demand in the company’s aerospace and defense businesses softened in the second half of 2009 however primarily due to declines in demand in the commercial aviation end markets continued capital project freezes by the united states postal service contributed to yearoveryear sales declines in the business’ integrated scanning system product line 

  

operating profit margins in the segment declined 160 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009 as well as 75 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008 the impact of the new business combination accounting standard requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after december 31 2008 combined with the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 10 basis points cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset these negative factors 

gross profit 

 

 gross profit margins for 2010 increased 300 basis points from 2009 the yearoveryear increase reflects the impact of higher sales volumes as compared to 2009 yearoveryear cost savings attributable to the company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 95 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010 gross profit margins during 2010 also benefited from the contribution to the apex joint venture at the beginning of the third quarter of certain of the company’s hand tools businesses that had lower average gross profit margins than the remainder of the company acquisition related charges recorded in 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of ab sciex molecular devices and certain other acquisitions adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by approximately 30 basis points 

gross profit margins for 2009 increased 40 basis points from 2008 cost savings related to 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities primarily drove the yearoveryear improvements in gross profit margin from 2008 to 2009 lower yearoveryear commodity costs also contributed to the improvement as costs for several types of raw materials increased sharply in 2008 before declining late in 2008 and into 2009 lower overall sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008 diminished the leverage of the company’s fixed cost base and partially offset these positive factors in addition costs incurred associated with yearoveryear incremental 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted gross profit margins by 65 basis points 

operating expenses 

 

 the yearoveryear decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2010 reflects the benefit of increased leverage of the company’s cost base resulting from higher sales volumes during 2010 as compared to 2009 in addition to 65 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared 

  

to 2010 incremental yearoveryear investments in the company’s sales growth initiatives increased commission costs due to the higher sales volumes and the dilutive effect of certain recently acquired businesses and those businesses’ higher relative operating expense structures partially offset these yearoveryear improvements 

the yearoveryear increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to reduced leverage of the company’s cost base caused by lower sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008 incremental yearoveryear costs associated with 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points on a yearoveryear basis although the 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions generated yearoveryear cost savings that partially offset these negative factors 

research and development expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points during 2010 on a yearoveryear basis the increase is primarily attributable to the contribution of the company’s hand tools businesses to the apex joint venture as the research and development spending of such businesses has historically been less than the company average overall research and development costs also increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to recently acquired businesses primarily ab sciex and molecular devices with higher average research and development expenditures as well as continued investment in the company’s new product development initiatives 

research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were flat during 2009 as compared to 2008 the company continued to invest in new product development within all of its businesses with particular emphasis on the medical technologies test and measurement environmental and product identification businesses

interest expense of 121 million in 2010 was essentially flat as compared to 2009 interest expense of 123 million in 2009 was 75 million lower than 2008 primarily as a result of lower average debt levels during 2009 as the company deployed cash flows to repay a portion of its commercial paper borrowings interest attributable to the 750 million principal amount of 540 senior unsecured notes issued in march 2009 partially offset the positive impact of the reduction in outstanding commercial paper borrowings 

  

the company recognized interest income of 6 million 5 million and 10 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively interest income in 2010 was higher than interest income in 2009 due to higher average invested cash balances interest income in 2009 was lower than interest income in 2008 as the lower interest rates on deposits in 2009 compared to 2008 more than offset higher average invested cash balances 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s financial statements  the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws the company’s effective tax rate for 2010 differs from the united states federal statutory rate of 35 primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the united states no provisions for united states income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states the amount of united states income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings as of december 31 2010 the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately 65 billion 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitation reserves are adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

yearoveryear changes in tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was 235 192 and 247 respectively 

the company’s 2010 effective tax rate of 235 reflects the benefit of earnings outside the united states taxed at rates lower than the us federal income tax rate the 2010 effective tax rate includes the benefit of approximately 50 basis points 115 million or 002 per diluted share of discrete tax reserve reductions associated with resolution of certain international and domestic tax positions and refinements of reserve estimates related to prior period tax contingencies the company’s tax provision was reduced by approximately 15 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of the extension of the research and experimentation credit and other us legislation enacted in december 2010 related to taxation of international earnings 

the company’s 2009 effective tax rate of 192 includes the impact of approximately 680 basis points 972 million or 015 per diluted share related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with the resolution of uncertain tax positions and discrete items the impact of expensing transaction costs in accordance with the business combination accounting standard that became effective at the beginning of 2009 much of which are not deductible for income tax purposes partially offset these beneficial factors 

the effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be approximately 255 the anticipated increase from the 2010 rate is largely attributable to recent us legislation effective as of the beginning of 2011 that repealed or modified certain tax provisions applicable to us companies having international operations that enable the use of foreign tax credits to offset us corporate income taxes 

  

inflation 

the effect of broad based inflation on the company’s operations was not significant in the twelve months ended december 31 2010 2009 or 2008 

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices each of which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2010 an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock by approximately 105 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity 

as of december 31 2010 the company’s variablerate debt obligations relate primarily to us dollar commercial paper borrowings and as a result its primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2010 as these obligations mature the company anticipates issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2010 a 100 increase in average market interest rates on the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 04 million a 100 hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2010 

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries the eurobond notes described below which as of december 31 2010 had outstanding borrowings in principal amount equivalent to 669 million provide a natural hedge to a portion of the company’s european net asset position the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries net of the translation effect of the company’s eurobond notes is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive income” component of stockholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at december 31 2010 net of the translation effect of the company’s eurobond notes would result in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 450 million 

the company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred and sales are generated in foreign currencies costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively 

  

currency exchange rates decreased reported 2010 sales by 05 on a yearoveryear basis as the us dollar was on average slightly stronger against other major currencies during 2010 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2009 the strengthening of the us dollar that began in the second quarter 2010 and prevailed throughout most of the remainder of 2010 more than offset the us dollar’s weakness against other major currencies during the first quarter of 2010 

if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2010 prevail throughout 2011 currency exchange rates will positively impact 2011 reported sales by approximately 10 relative to the company’s performance in 2010 weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would have a further positive impact on the company’s reported sales and results of operations any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments and trade accounts receivable the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company’s businesses perform ongoing credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions and typically obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

equity price risk 

the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities a 10 decline in the value of these equity securities as of december 31 2010 would have reduced the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio by approximately 26 million 

commodity price risk

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions and maintain its capital structure on a short and longterm basis for a discussion of risks related to the uncertainty in the financial markets and the global economy in general please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

operating activities 

the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes restructuring activities pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flow was approximately 21 billion for 2010 an increase of 284 million or 16 as compared to 2009 the increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings in 2010 as compared to 2009 partially offsetting this benefit was an investment in trade accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable which in the aggregate used 204 million of cash flow during 2010 as compared to contributing 228 million of cash flow during 2009 the increased use of cash reflects increased inventory and accounts receivable levels partially offset by increased accounts payable levels associated with increased business activity 

operating cash flow was approximately 18 billion for 2009 a decrease of 58 million or approximately 3 as compared to 2008 the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the decrease in earnings in 2009 as compared to 2008 and to a lesser extent attributable to the yearoveryear incremental amount of cash paid related to the company’s restructuring activities in addition the company voluntarily contributed 60 million to the company’s us defined benefit pension plan in 2009 while it made no contribution in 2008 the declines in operating cash flow were partially offset by cash generated from the aggregate of trade accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable which contributed 228 million of cash flow during 2009 as compared to contributing 108 million of cash flow during 2008 increased collections of accounts receivable and reduced inventory levels partially offset by reductions in accounts payable associated with lower levels of business activity benefited cash flow in 2009 as compared to 2008 a decline of approximately 100 million in tax payments during 2009 as compared to 2008 also partially offset the decline in operating cash flow 

in connection with the company’s restructuring activities the company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing facilities severing personnel and in connection with acquisitions integrating the acquired businesses into existing company operations cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with these activities during 2010 the company paid approximately 110 million related to its 2009 restructuring activities during 2009 the company paid approximately 161 million related to its 2009 and 2008 restructuring activities and approximately 29 million related to restructuring activities associated with acquisitions completed prior to december 31 2008 please refer to note 2 and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these expenditures 

investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets net cash used in investing activities was 23 billion during 2010 compared to 943 million of net cash used in 2009 gross capital spending of 217 million during 2010 was approximately 29 million more than gross capital spending during 2009 capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity replacing equipment supporting new product development and improving information technology systems in 2011 the company expects capital spending to approximate 250 million though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions 

net cash used in investing activities was approximately 943 million in 2009 compared to approximately 567 in 2008 gross capital spending of 194 million in 2009 decreased approximately 5 million from 2008 capital spending levels 

as discussed below the company completed numerous business acquisitions and divestitures during 2010 2009 and 2008 all of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the company’s financial statements this goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses the multiple to earnings cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers the competitive nature of the process by which the company acquired the business and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations for a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

financing activities and indebtedness

for additional details regarding the company’s debt as of december 31 2010 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt except in connection with the change of control provisions described as follows under each of the eurobond notes the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes if the company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control the company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of the 2018 notes and 2019 notes or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of eurobond notes the company’s outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and saleleaseback transactions none of these covenants are considered restrictive to the company’s operations and as of december 31 2010 the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants for a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

commercial paper program and credit facility 

the company satisfies its shortterm liquidity needs primarily through issuances of us dollar and euro denominated commercial paper under the company’s us dollar and euro commercial paper programs the company or a subsidiary of the company as applicable may issue and sell unsecured shortterm promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40 billion since the credit facilities described below provide credit support for the program the 1525 billion of availability under the credit facilities has the practical effect of reducing from 40 billion to 1525 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the company can issue under the program borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions the company classifies the borrowings under the commercial paper program as longterm borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the company has the intent and the ability as supported by the availability of the credit facility to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date 

credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured 145 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with a syndicate of banks that expires on april 25 2012 and an unsecured 75 million multicurrency revolving credit facility that expires on may 3 2011 the “supplemental credit facility” and together with the credit facility the “credit facilities” the credit facilities can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes under the credit facility interest is based on at the company’s option 1 a liborbased formula that is dependent in part on the company’s credit rating 2 a formula based on the higher as of the date of determination of bank of america’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or 3 the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility under the supplemental credit facility interest is based on at the company’s option 1 a liborbased formula or 2 a formula based on the highest as of the date of determination of the lender’s prime rate the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or the libor rate plus 100 basis points both of the credit facilities require the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity as of the last day of each quarter of 065 to 100 or less as of december 31 2010 the company was in compliance with this covenant the availability of the credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of our commercial paper program we expect to limit any borrowings under the credit facilities to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it matures the company anticipates seeking a renewal of the term of the supplemental credit facility from the lender prior to its scheduled expiration 

during 2010 the company refinanced balances under its commercial paper program as they came due to maintain an outstanding balance throughout the year amounts outstanding under the company’s us dollar commercial paper program as of december 31 2010 had a weighted average interest rate of 025 and a weighted average maturity of approximately 11 days the company had no outstanding euro denominated commercial paper as of december 31 2010 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions any downgrade in the company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program and credit facility and could limit or preclude the company’s ability to issue commercial paper if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash operating cash flow and our credit facilities to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

  

in addition to the credit facilities the company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit

in 2001 the company issued 830 million value at maturity in lyons the net proceeds to the company were 505 million of which approximately 100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions the lyons carry a yield to maturity of 2375 with contingent interest payable as described below holders of the lyons may convert each 1000 of principal amount at maturity into 290704 shares of danaher common stock in the aggregate for all lyons that were originally issued approximately 240 million shares of danaher common stock at any time on or before the maturity date of january 22 2021 as of december 31 2010 an aggregate of approximately 24 million shares of danaher common stock had been issued upon conversion of lyons from january 1 2011 through february 11 2011 holders of certain of the company’s liquid yield option notes lyons converted such lyons into an aggregate of approximately 52 million shares of danaher common stock par value 001 per share as of december 31 2010 the accreted value of the outstanding lyons was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion the company may redeem all or a portion of the lyons for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices holders had the right to require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash andor company common stock at the company’s option on january 22 2011 which resulted in notes with an accreted value of approximately 13 thousand being redeemed by the company for cash the holders had a similar option to require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of january 22 2004 which resulted in notes with an accreted value of 11 million being redeemed by the company for cash 

under the terms of the lyons the company will pay contingent interest to the holders of lyons during any six month period from january 23 to july 22 and from july 23 to january 22 if the average market price of a lyon for a specified measurement period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such lyon the amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 00315 of the bonds’ average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a lyon the company paid approximately 21 million of contingent interest on the lyons for the year ended december 31 2010 except for the contingent interest described above the company will not pay interest on the lyons prior to maturity

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters the company has not included any such items in the table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but the company does not believe that any such liability will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products or claims alleging that company products infringe thirdparty intellectual property the company cannot estimate its maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions and has not accrued any liabilities in its consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in our contractual commitments table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding certain litigation matters 

  

in addition to the litigation matters noted under “item 1 business – regulatory matters – environmental health  safety” and “item 3 legal proceedings” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices personal injury and insurance coverage the company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages based upon the company’s experience current information and applicable law it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows financial position or results of operations 

while the company maintains general products property workers’ compensation automobile cargo aviation crime fiduciary and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions up to certain limits that cover a portion of these claims this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses for general and products liability and most other insured risks the company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the selfinsured retention in addition while the company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses 

the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable the company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters as well as amounts or ranges of probable losses and if appropriate recognizes a reserve for these contingencies these reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk insurance professionals where appropriate in addition outside risk insurance professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments including litigation developments the discovery of new facts changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy while the company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude the company believes the liability recorded for such contingencies as of december 31 2010 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate if the company’s selfinsurance and litigation reserves prove inadequate it would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the amount of our accruals for selfinsurance and litigation liability

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and 2 material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the company’s trade accounts contract and finance receivable portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality the company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances while amounts recovered on previously writtenoff accounts increase the allowances if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional reserves would be required 

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control as a result such fluctuations can be difficult to predict if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur the company does not amortize goodwill but does amortize certain identifiable intangible assets primarily customer relationships and acquired technology over the estimated useful life of the identified asset on an annual basis the first day of the company’s fiscal fourth quarter the company estimates the fair value of each of its reporting units and compares the fair value of each unit to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the company must perform additional analysis to determine if the reporting unit’s goodwill has been impaired if circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that there has been diminution of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value the company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach the company estimates fair value based on ebitda multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units in addition to market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach in certain circumstances once completed the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared the 

  

discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of december 31 2010 the company had 27 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from approximately 66 million to approximately 21 billion the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2010 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 16 to approximately 617 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 4 to approximately 545 

contingent liabilities  as discussed above under “—legal proceedings” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed above under “—legal proceedings” if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

revenue recognition  the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services for revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition there must be persuasive evidence of a sale delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured see note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies although most of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for sales recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value fair values of undelivered elements are known there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized for delivered elements 

sharebased compensation  the company accounts for sharebased compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted including stock options restricted stock units “rsus” and restricted shares based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date for a discussion of the company’s sharebased compensation accounting practices please see note 16 to the company’s consolidated financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and the company uses different assumptions the company’s equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest if the company’s actual forfeiture rate during a reporting period is materially different than its estimate the company’s earnings may be significantly impacted as the company records the effect of actual experience in the period it occurs 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits  certain of the company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans pension plans and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans postretirement plans the company measures its pension and post retirement plans’ assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan the company recognizes an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status in its statement of financial position changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income accounting standards require that the amounts the company records including the expense or income associated with the pension and postretirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations 

calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rate of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors while the company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate changes in the assumptions as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors may affect the company’s financial position or results of operations for the us plan the company used a 52 discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at december 31 2010 which represents a decrease of 55 basis points in the discount rate from december 31 2009 for nonus plans rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the us and nonus net obligation by 59 million 40 million on an after tax basis from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2010 

for 2010 the expected longterm rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the us plan has been estimated at 8 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan targets to invest between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 05 pension expense for 2010 would have increased 5 million or 3 million on an aftertax basis the company’s nonus plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 125 to 720 for 2010 and ranged from 075 to 80 for 2009 

for a discussion of the company’s 2010 and anticipated 2011 defined benefit pension plan contributions please see “liquidity and capital resources —cash and cash requirements” 

income taxes  the company’s income tax expense represents the current tax liability for the year and the tax benefit or expense for the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the company’s tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies and can also be impacted by changes to tax laws deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on the company’s tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the company’s consolidated statements of earnings the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 

the company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when based upon the technical merits it is “morelikelythannot” that the position will be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions the company generally reevaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when i there is completion of tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 

  

an increase in our nominal tax rate of 10 percent would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 of approximately 23 million 

new accounting standards 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200913 “multipledeliverable revenue arrangements” this asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenuegenerating activities and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting the amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor’s multipledeliverable revenue arrangements including information about the nature and terms significant deliverables and its performance within arrangements the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative sellingprice method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition concurrent with the issuance of asu no 200913 the fasb issued asu no 200914 “certain revenue arrangements that include software elements” this asu changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are “essential to the functionality” and scopes these products out of current software revenue guidance the new guidance includes factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered “essential to the functionality” the amendments will now subject softwareenabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables effective january 1 2011 the company adopted on a prospective basis the provisions of these updated accounting standards related to revenue recognition associated with contractual arrangements involving multiple elements and contractual arrangements involving tangible products that include software the company cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary depending on the nature and volume of new or materially modified transactions in any given period

the following discussions of materials intellectual property competition seasonal nature of business working capital backlog employee relations research and development government contracts regulatory matters international operations and major customers include information common to all of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including steel copper cast iron electronic components aluminum plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas also affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications there may be a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in our supply chain including the use of alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources there have been no raw material shortages that have had a material adverse effect on our business as a whole although over the last two years the prices of raw materials have been volatile and for several types of raw materials prices increased sharply in 2008 before declining late in 2008 and into 2009 for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time however we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher or its subsidiaries 

competition 

although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the diversity of the products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product lines but typically include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business as well as price quality delivery speed service and support innovation distribution network and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and endmarkets that they serve for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products and sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

backlog 

the table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our four segments at the end of 2009 and 2008  in millions 

 

 we expect that a large majority of unfilled orders will be delivered to customers within 3 to 4 months given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm performance 

  

employee relations 

at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 46600 persons of which approximately 21100 were employed in the united states and approximately 25500 were employed outside of the united states of our united states employees approximately 1500 were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils for a discussion of risks related to employee relations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

research and development 

the table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate  in millions 

 

  

 we conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products enhancing the functionality effectiveness ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of our products are appropriate our research and development efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position for a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” customersponsored research and development was not significant in 2009 2008 and 2007 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2009 was from customers other than governmental entities we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense product identification water quality motion and mechanics’ hand tool businesses as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

we face comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products and services the following sections describe certain of these regulations 

  

environmental laws and regulations 

our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with our operations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition to environmental compliance costs we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the current and former owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and nonus environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others previously disposed of hazardous wastes andor are or were property owners require cleanup and other possible remedial action including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal and state environmental laws and regulations we have projects underway at a number of current and former facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have made a provision for environmental investigation and remediation and environmentalrelated personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries and thirdparty sites where we have been determined to be a potentially responsible party refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the amount of our environmental provisions we generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with similar sites if the company determines that potential remediation liability for a particular site is probable and reasonably estimable it accrues the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site we also accrue a liability for our exposure for probable and reasonably estimable environmentalrelated personal injury claims while we actively pursue insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude 

the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations all provisions have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future third party recoveries for the reasons described above we cannot assure you that our estimates of environmental liabilities will not change 

in view of our financial position and provisions for environmental remediation matters and environmentalrelated personal injury claims and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect we believe that our liability related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow for a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

  

medical devices 

certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration the “fda” and by the comparable agencies of the nonus countries where our products are sold some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the united states 

pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fda regulates virtually all phases of the development manufacture sale and distribution of medical devices including their introduction into interstate commerce manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping pursuant to the fdca and fda regulations certain facilities of our operating subsidiaries are registered with the fda as medical device manufacturing establishments the fda as well as industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization “iso” regularly inspect our registered andor certified facilities 

we sell both class i and class ii medical devices a medical device whether exempt from or cleared pursuant to the premarket notification requirements of the fdca or approved pursuant to a premarket approval application is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the fda to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements including but not limited to product labeling requirements and limitations including those related to promotion and marketing efforts quality system requirements and medical device adverse event reporting certain of our products utilize radioactive material and we are subject to federal state and local regulations governing the management storage handling and disposal of these materials in addition we are subject to various federal state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry including antikickback and false claims laws for a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and other regulatory regimes referenced above please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

exportimport compliance 

we are required to comply with various us exportimport control and economic sanctions laws including 

 

  

  

  

 other nation’s governments have also implemented similar export and import control regulations which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

our products and services are available worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we believe this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries the table below describes annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate 

 

   

the table below describes longlived assets located outside the united states as a percentage of total longlived assets in each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate 

 

 for additional information related to revenues and longlived assets by country please refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and for information regarding deferred taxes by geography please refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the manner in which our products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of our sales in nonus markets are made by subsidiaries located outside the united states though we also sell directly from the us into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors in countries with low sales volumes we generally sell through representatives and distributors 

financial information about our international operations is contained in note 19 of the consolidated financial statements and information about the possible effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of risks related to our nonus operations and foreign currency exchange please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

major customers

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as us and nonus economic and financial market conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism international conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us although conditions in the global economy and financial markets have improved in the last several months the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets that began in the latter half of 2008 has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors customers and suppliers these conditions have had and may in the future have the effect of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we have initiated several restructuring actions to adjust our cost structure to reflect changing demand levels but there can be no assurances these or any other costreduction actions will be successful in effectively matching our cost structure to levels of demand in addition although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets through the date of this report there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

the restructuring actions that we are taking to reduce costs could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

since october 2008 we have announced multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses with the objective of adjusting our cost structure to reflect changing demand levels these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities have the effect of reducing our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and technologies adversely affect our ability to respond to customers limit our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limit our ability to hire and retain key personnel these circumstances could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and profits are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability in addition certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns that 

  

adversely impact demand for the equipment and services that we sell competitive pricing pressures slowdowns in capital investments and other downturns in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see “item 1 business – competition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services designed to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product categories and penetrating new markets including in developing countries our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues profitability and cash flow and pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our profitability 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis our products will become technologically obsolete over time and our revenues cash flow profitability and competitive position will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate 

we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory including antitrust approvals changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or uncertainty in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions our ability to grow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings 

our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see the section titled “liquidity and capital resources – investing activities” in the mda for additional details our acquisitions involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition future divestitures could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters and have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 

at december 31 2009 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill other intangible assets and other longterm assets totaled approximately 144 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to these assets any such impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may have an adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices and also 

  

decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices likewise decreased strength of the us dollar could have an adverse effect on the cost of materials products and services purchased overseas in addition our sales and expenses are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into us dollars 

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery antikickback and false claims rules competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions please see the section titled “income taxes” in the mda for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities due to the ambiguity of tax laws and the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 

the obama administration has announced proposals to tax profits of us companies earned abroad while it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented or how they will ultimately impact us they may adversely impact our results of operations 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our operations the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons our failure or inability to obtain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations 

we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights 

  

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position revenues profitability and cash flows even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to our business including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisitionrelated matters these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition operations and results of operations moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures in addition developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements or make estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates which could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the us and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will be at all times effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us 

  

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

in addition to the environmental regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the federal state and local levels including the following 

 

  

  

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to manufacture import and export products and services and damage to our reputation compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the iso and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 29 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to incur an additional 13 billion of indebtedness under our outstanding commercial paper facilities we may also incur additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

   

  

 we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly in connection with acquisitions if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

our current revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on us including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets and require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of 065 to 10 or less in addition our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with crossdefault provisions could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our expenses and funding obligations relating to our defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows for example the declines in the global capital markets since the first half of 2008 have resulted in significant declines in the fair value of our pension plan assets 

we may incur higher costs to produce our products if commodity prices rise 

as discussed in “item 1 business – materials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of raw materials over the last two years the prices of raw materials have been volatile due to the highly competitive nature of the industries which we serve and the costcontainment efforts of our customers if commodity prices rise we may be unable to fully pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher raw material costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our purchases of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changing market conditions or customer demand our income and results of operations may suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

  

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we could face manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity to reflect the demand for our products our income and results of operations may suffer 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

changes in governmental regulations and funding may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as health and safety environmental and food and drug regulations and regulations governing communications we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the failure of governmental and other entities to adopt new regulations or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect our growth rate 

we may be unable to adjust to changes in the healthcare industry some of which could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce costs these changes include legislative healthcare reform wider implementation of managed care consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates some of these potential changes may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services reduce the amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or thirdparty payors reduce the volume of medical procedures or impose excise taxes on medical device companies these changes could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance or purchasing patterns of key distributors resellers and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors resellers and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare could adversely impact our profitability 

  

international economic political legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in 2009 approximately 52 of our sales were derived from customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the us since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in emerging markets our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and growth 

if we suffer loss to our facilities distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility

 overview 

general 

please see “item 1 business – general” for a discussion of danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations during 2009 approximately 52 of danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors for example in those industry segments where the company is a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the company’s customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of its products and services typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results however the broad impact of the worldwide credit market turmoil and economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 negatively impacted the results of operations of most of the company’s businesses given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of challenges and opportunities including rapid technological development in most of our served markets the expansion of opportunities in emerging markets trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and consolidation of our competitors we operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and our longterm growth will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business including through geographical and product line expansion identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative new products with higher gross profit margins and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness we are making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address the rapid pace of technological change in our served markets and to globalize our manufacturing and customer facing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of our operations 

business performance 

during 2009 lower spending and investment by both businesses and consumers resulted in a substantial decline in demand for most of the company’s products these conditions began in the third quarter of 2008 as global financial markets were in turmoil and continued throughout 2009 demand stabilized in most businesses in the fourth quarter of 2009 sales declined across all segments and major geographic regions particularly in the united states and europe unfavorable foreign currency translation also negatively impacted results for the year due to the strengthening of the us dollar as compared with 2008 given the difficult economic environment the company implemented significant restructuring actions to rationalize its cost structure to a level appropriate for the conditions refer note 17 to the consolidated financial statements despite the challenging environment the operating margin impacts of lower sales levels and restructuring costs were partially offset by the benefits of 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions other productivity improvements higher pricing in certain markets and lower material costs the company also generated operating cash flow near the same level as 2008 primarily by reducing inventory levels to reflect the lower levels of customer demand and by effectively managing accounts receivable the company also took advantage of an improving acquisition market in 2009 by consummating fifteen acquisitions as discussed below and signing definitive agreements to acquire an additional three businesses 

  

acquisitions 

the company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009 for consideration of approximately 704 million in cash net of cash acquired these businesses were acquired to complement existing units of the medical technologies professional instrumentation and industrial technologies segments the aggregate annual sales of these fifteen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately 430 million 

subsequent to december 31 2009 the company completed the previously announced acquisition of the analytical technologies division of mds which includes a 50 ownership position in the applied biosystemsmds sciex joint venture “ab sciex” a mass spectrometry business and a 100 ownership position in the molecular devices corporation a bioresearch and analytical instrumentation company in a separate but related transaction the company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50 ownership position in ab sciex from life technologies corporation the aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions was 11 billion including debt assumed and net of cash acquired ab sciex and molecular devices corporation now operate within the company’s medical technologies segment and are expected to increase the medical technologies segment’s annual revenues by approximately 650 million the acquisition of ab sciex significantly expands the company’s position in the life sciences and diagnostics business and in particular establishes a position in the mass spectrometry market ab sciex is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities in the company’s medical technologies segment both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses company management and other personnel are devoting significant resources to the successful integration of the acquired businesses into danaher 

settlement of litigation 

during the third quarter of 2009 ormco corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of the company settled certain litigation pending between ormco and align technology inc align among other provisions as part of the settlement align paid 13 million in cash to ormco and issued to the company 76 million shares of align common stock which following issuance represented an approximately ten percent ownership interest in align the company recorded a pretax gain of 85 million 53 million after tax or 016 per share related to the settlement representing the cash received and the value of the shares received on the date the shares were issued to the company net of 13 million of related legal and direct settlement costs incurred this gain is reflected as “other income expense” in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings 

restructuring activities 

during 2009 the company recorded pretax restructuring and other related charges totaling 2385 million of the total 2009 restructuring costs incurred 1923 million 1444 million net of tax or 043 per diluted share was incurred pursuant to plans approved by the company in april and august of 2009 and 462 million was incurred in connection with the company’s normal ongoing restructuring actions the plans approved by the company in april and august 2009 reflected management’s assessment that adjustments to the company’s ongoing cost structure were appropriate in light of lower demand in most of the company’s end markets resulting from the overall deterioration in global economic conditions that began in the latter half of 2008 and continued through 2009 these 2009 restructuring actions include employeerelated and facility shutdown costs of 2281 million and noncash asset writeoffs of 104 million cash expenditures for these restructuring activities are being funded with cash generated from operations as of december 31 2009 cash payments of 1065 million related to these actions have been made the company’s 2009 restructuring activities generated approximately 50 million pretax savings during 2009 and the company expects to realize approximately 170 million of incremental yearoveryear pretax savings during 2010 associated with these restructuring activities 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the company recorded pretax restructuring and other related charges totaling 820 million 615 million net of tax or 018 per diluted share relating to restructuring actions designed to better position the company’s cost base in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions these charges included 

  

cash employeerelated and facility shutdown costs of 76 million and noncash asset writeoffs of 6 million all required cash payments related to the actions have been made as of december 31 2009 the 2008 restructuring activities generated approximately 100 million of pretax savings during 2009 and the company expects comparable annual savings in future years 

refer to note 17 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these restructuring activities the impact of these restructuring costs on each of the company’s reportable segments is discussed in the “–results of operations  business segments” below 

outlook 

while differences exist among the company’s businesses the yearoveryear sales declines during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the yearoveryear sales declines during each of the first three quarters of 2009 due in part to an improving global economic environment as well as easier yearoveryear comparisons the improved rates of decline were most evident in the product identification test and measurement dental and life sciences and diagnostics businesses as economic conditions continue to stabilize and providing no unforeseen significant deterioration in general economic conditions occurs the company expects modest overall sales growth during 2010 as compared to 2009 the restructuring actions undertaken by the company in 2008 and 2009 targeted at reducing the company’s ongoing cost structure are expected to positively impact the company’s earnings and operating cash flow in 2010 and future periods the additional operating cash flow generated by these cost savings will continue to be strategically deployed to strengthen the company’s competitive position and accelerate its sales and earnings potential 

results of operations 

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 12 compared to 2008 sales from existing businesses declined 12 on a yearoveryear basis the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 20 as the us dollar was on average stronger against other major currencies during 2009 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2008 recently acquired businesses provided sales growth of approximately 20 in this report references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales calculated according to gaap but excluding 1 sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition and 2 the impact of currency translation references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or recently acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding acquisition sales and b the periodtoperiod change in revenue excluding acquisition sales after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period 

operating profit margins were 138 in the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 147 for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in operating profit margins during 2009 is primarily a result of lower sales volumes in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the level incurred during 2008 which reduced operating profit margin comparisons by 115 basis points on a yearoveryear basis in addition the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 20 basis points cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins the gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the align litigation settlement also favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points in addition accounting charges recorded in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the november 2007 acquisition of tektronix net of comparable acquisitionrelated charges recorded in 2009 favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 10 basis points the company anticipates that the dilutive effect of acquisitions and acquisitionrelated accounting charges are factors that will continue to adversely impact operating profit margins in future periods while the impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and the company’s ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses are factors that will continue to benefit operating profit margins in future periods

 components of sales growth decline 

 

   

2009 compared to 2008 

the yearoveryear decline in sales during 2009 is principally attributable to declines in the segment’s test and measurement lines of business price increases contributed 15 sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the changes in sales from existing businesses 

operating profit margins decreased 190 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009 as well as 145 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008 the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses also adversely impacted operating profit margins on a yearoveryear basis by 45 basis points accounting charges incurred in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the november 2007 acquisition of tektronix net of comparable acquisitionrelated charges recorded in 2009 favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 70 basis points cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses also partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins 

overview of businesses within professional instrumentation segment 

environmental  sales from the segment’s environmental businesses representing 57 of segment sales for 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008 sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 10 and the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 25 growth of 35 related to recently acquired businesses offset these sales declines 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses during 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008 a midteens growth rate in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line and a midsingle digit growth rate in the industrial water treatment product line offset lowsingle digit sales declines in the business’ laboratory and process instrumentation product line growth rates in the ultraviolet water treatment product line reflect strength in demand for municipal wastewater applications as well as shipments related to a significant drinking water treatment plant project that commenced in 2009 and is expected to be substantially completed during 2010 in the business’ laboratory and process instrumentation product line and associated consumables general economic conditions adversely impacted demand in all major geographies with the exception of china where revenues grew at a low doubledigit rate during 2009 

sales from existing businesses in the retail petroleum equipment business during 2009 declined at a lowsingle digit rate as compared to 2008 strong north american sales of the business’ pointofsale retail and payment solution product offerings that are being driven in part by regulatory requirements were more than offset by lower demand for dispensing equipment primarily in europe and service offerings lower demand for the business’ automatic tank gauge product offerings and leak detection systems also adversely impacted yearoveryear comparisons the decline in demand for the business’ leak detection systems was partially attributable to a significant project in 2008 that did not repeat in 2009 

test  measurement  sales in the segment’s test and measurement businesses representing 43 of segment sales for 2009 declined 220 as compared to 2008 sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 240 while the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 10 sales growth of 30 related to recently acquired businesses partially offset these declines 

soft demand across all instrumentation related product lines attributable to general economic conditions and inventory reductions by distributors drove sales declines during 2009 while yearoveryear sales declined during each quarter during 2009 the rate of decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year primarily due to the adverse impact of inventory level reductions in the distribution channel that were largely completed by the end of the third quarter yearoveryear comparisons for the fourth quarter were also favorably impacted by the decline in demand that commenced in the fourth quarter 2008 resulting in an easier comparison sales declined in all significant geographic regions yearoveryear sales in the network and communication businesses declined at a lower rate than the instrumentation business primarily as a result of positive performance in the network management solutions businesses which benefited from the competition among mobile telecommunication providers to expand coverage services and performance of their networks 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

segment sales for professional instrumentation increased 375 for 2008 as compared to 2007 sales growth was experienced in both of the segment’s strategic lines of business during the year with the majority of the growth coming from acquisitions price increases accounted for approximately 20 sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses 

fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the professional instrumentation segment by 60 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007 in addition the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 295 basis points including the adverse impact of acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue fair value charges recorded related to the acquisition of tektronix the company also incurred tektronixrelated charges in 2007 associated with acquired inprocess research and development that affected yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 170 basis points 

depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the tektronix acquisition 

overview of businesses within professional instrumentation segment 

environmental  sales from the company’s environmental businesses representing approximately 51 of segment sales for 2008 increased 155 in 2008 compared to 2007 sales from existing businesses accounted for 65 growth while acquisitions accounted for 75 growth and currency translation accounted for 15 growth 

the segment’s water quality businesses experienced highsingle digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007 this growth was primarily a result of strong laboratory and process sales reflecting in part the results of increased sales force investments and penetration into emerging markets growth in sales was experienced in all major geographic regions with particular strength in asia where sales increased at a double digit rate also contributing to the yearoveryear growth was increased demand by municipalities for the businesses’ ultraviolet disinfection water treatment product offerings which experienced a midteens sales growth rate 

the retail petroleum equipment business experienced midsingle digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007 this growth was primarily driven by strong sales of payment and point of sale retail and payment solution product offerings offset by a decline in dispensing equipment sales primarily in north america and europe an increase in demand for the business’ vapor recovery products in north america also contributed to the yearoveryear sales growth primarily related to an enhanced vapor recovery product that received regulatory approval and launched during the fourth quarter of 2008 

test and measurement  sales from the company’s test and measurement businesses representing approximately 49 of segment sales for 2008 grew 70 compared to 2007 sales from existing businesses were essentially flat while acquisitions accounted for 680 growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 20 growth 

sales growth from existing businesses was driven primarily by performance during the first nine months of 2008 as a result of strong sales of the business’ thermography and precision measurement product offerings as well as strong growth from investments in emerging markets while demand for the business’ thermography products continued to increase as compared to 2007 during the fourth quarter demand slowed for the business’ traditional industrial digital handheld instruments and precision measurement products resulting in a midsingle digit rate sales decline in the quarter and offsetting the growth experienced in the first nine months in addition the sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 is a result of reductions of inventory in the distribution channel as well as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility on customer demand in certain emerging markets sales also declined throughout 2008 in the business’ enterprise network performance management line of business as a result of generally lower telecommunications demand and slower information technology spending by customers

 components of sales growth decline 

 

 2009 compared to 2008 

during 2009 sales growth in the segment’s acute care diagnostic and pathology diagnostic businesses was more than offset by sales declines in the segment’s life sciences instrumentation and dental businesses price increases contributed 10 sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

operating profit margins increased 130 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008 the gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the align litigation settlement favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 270 basis points restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the levels incurred during 2008 reduced operating profit margins by 105 basis points on a yearoveryear basis and the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 15 basis points the adoption of the new business combination accounting standard requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after december 31 2008 also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 55 basis points while the yearoveryear sales declines diminished leverage of the segment’s fixed cost base the 2009 cost savings attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses offset this adverse impact 

overview of businesses within medical technologies segment 

sales in the segment’s existing acute care diagnostics business grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008 continued strong aftermarket consumables sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation drove the majority of the growth during 2009 increased sales of the business’ 

  

cardiac marking instrument also contributed to the yearoveryear growth and are expected to further benefit sales in 2010 sales grew at a doubledigit rate in china and the emerging economies of latin america during 2009 while combined europe and north america sales were flat 

sales in the segment’s existing life science instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008 sales growth attributable to pathology diagnostic instrumentation and associated consumable products primarily outside of north america was more than offset by sales declines attributable to lower demand for compound and stereo microscopy equipment primarily in europe and north america lower demand for microscopy equipment resulted largely from lower capital spending in the company’s customer base throughout 2009 while yearoveryear sales in the life sciences instrumentation business declined in each quarter during 2009 the rate of yearoveryear decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year as economic stimulus funding primarily in japan began to favorably impact the business north american stimulus funding did not significantly benefit the business in 2009 but is expected to positively impact the company’s results in 2010 

sales in the segment’s existing dental businesses declined at a highsingle digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008 sales in the dental consumables business during 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008 increased sales of orthodontia and infection control products during 2009 were offset by weaker demand for implants endodontic products and general dentistry consumables lower capital spending by customers and inventory reductions in certain distribution channels drove yearoveryear sales declines at a midteen rate in the dental technologies businesses while yearoveryear sales in the dental technologies business declined in each quarter during 2009 the rate of yearoveryear decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year due to strong sales of treatment units in europe as well as easier yearoveryear comparisons due to a large stocking order for imaging equipment that occurred in the third quarter 2008 the company’s acquisition of palodex a leading manufacturer of dental imaging products in the fourth quarter of 2009 will provide additional sales growth in the company’s dental imaging business in 2010 

2008 compared to 2007 

segment sales for medical technologies increased 95 for 2008 as compared to 2007 sales growth was primarily driven by the segment’s acute care diagnostics life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses price increases accounted for approximately 10 sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses 

the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the medical technologies segment by 80 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007 in addition the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 40 basis points a decline in demand for certain products in the dental technologies business in addition to increased sales force investment and research and development costs within the life sciences business also adversely impacted yearoveryear operating margin profit comparisons 

overview of businesses within medical technologies segment 

revenues in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at midsingle digit rate in 2008 as compared to 2007 the yearoveryear growth was primarily attributable to strong aftermarket consumables sales for the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation sales of the business’ compact version of its blood gas analysis instrument as well as sales resulting from the launch of the business’ aqt cardiac marker during 2008 sales growth was experienced in all major geographic regions during the year particularly strong growth in emerging markets during the first nine months of the year moderated during the fourth quarter as a result of currency exchange rate volatility and economic uncertainty 

the segment’s life science instrumentation business experienced highsingle digit revenue growth in 2008 as compared to 2007 continued strong sales of the business’ pathology diagnostics instrumentation and consumables offerings as well as compound microscopy product offerings drove the majority of this growth all major geographic regions experienced growth 

  

the segment’s dental business’ revenue in 2008 was essentially flat as compared to 2007 revenues in the dental technologies business grew at a midsingle digit rate through the first nine months of 2008 primarily driven by strong demand for imaging equipment however a significant decline in demand in the fourth quarter for the majority of the products in the dental technologies’ business including imaging equipment more than offset this earlier growth resulting in lowsingle digit sales declines for the year the decline in demand is primarily attributable to customer decisions to cancel or delay capital spending as well as inventory reductions in certain distribution channels offsetting the 2008 sales declines in the dental technologies business was lowsingle digit growth in the dental consumables business sales growth in the dental consumables’ businesses was primarily due to strong sales of general dentistry consumables and increased demand for endodontic and infection control products offset by lower demand in the orthodontia product line

industrial technologies segment selected financial data 

 

 components of sales growth decline 

 

 2009 compared to 2008 

sales declines in a majority of the segment’s businesses during 2009 more than offset sales growth of approximately 15 related to price increases which are reflected as a component of the decrease in sales from existing businesses 

  

operating profit margins in the segment declined 160 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009 as well as 75 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008 the adoption of the new business combination accounting standard requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after december 31 2008 combined with the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 10 basis points cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset these negative factors 

overview of businesses within industrial technologies segment 

product identification  sales from the segment’s product identification businesses representing approximately 29 of segment sales during 2009 declined 105 as compared to 2008 sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 80 while the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 40 sales growth of 15 related to recently acquired businesses partially offset these declines 

sales declines from existing businesses during 2009 resulted primarily from weak demand for core marking and coding equipment due to lower capital spending by customers as a result of general economic conditions sales of consumable products associated with the businesses’ installed base of marking and coding equipment also declined on a yearoveryear basis but not as significantly as equipment sales during the fourth quarter of 2009 equipment sales increased on a yearoveryear basis primarily due to emerging market growth flat consumable product sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 were an improvement to yearoveryear consumable sales declines during the first three quarters of the year sales in the china market grew during the second half of 2009 resulting in lowsingle digit sales growth for the full year continued capital project freezes by the united states postal service contributed to yearoveryear sales declines in the business’ integrated scanning system product line 

motion  sales from the segment’s motion businesses representing approximately 27 of segment sales during 2009 declined 335 as compared to 2008 sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 300 while the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 35 

sales from existing businesses declined as a result of weak demand for most of the businesses’ product offerings attributable to the recessionary economic conditions that existed throughout 2009 while yearoveryear sales in the motion businesses declined in each quarter during 2009 the rate of yearoveryear decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved slightly compared to the second and third quarters of the year due to improvements in demand for certain product offerings and the absence of inventory reductions experienced in early 2009 in the business’ distribution channels 

focused niche businesses  sales in the segment’s niche businesses declined at a lowdouble digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008 the company’s sensors and controls business saw modest improvement in certain end markets during the fourth quarter 2009 as compared to the first nine months of 2009 demand in the company’s aerospace and defense businesses softened in the second half of 2009 however primarily due to declines in demand in the commercial aviation end markets 

2008 compared to 2007 

segment sales for industrial technologies increased 35 for 2008 as compared to 2007 sales growth experienced for the majority of the year in the segment’s motion and niche aerospace and defense and sensors lines of business was partially offset by sales declines experienced in the segment’s product identification line of business primarily in the second half of 2008 price increases accounted for approximately 20 sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses 

the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the industrial technologies segment by 70 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007 in addition gains recorded in 2007 due to the collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit and from the sale of real estate adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points operating profit margin improvements during 2008 primarily relating to cost savings initiatives implemented beginning in late 2007 partially offset these adverse impacts 

  

overview of businesses within industrial technologies segment 

product identification  the product identification businesses accounted for approximately 27 of segment sales in 2008 sales from the segment’s product identification businesses decreased 15 in 2008 compared to 2007 sales from existing businesses accounted for a 35 decline in sales while currency translation contributed 15 to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 05 to revenue growth in 2008 

through the first nine months of 2008 sales growth driven by increased demand for both consumable products and services associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment had partially offset a decline in equipment sales further weakening of equipment demand during the fourth quarter primarily in north america and europe resulted in doubledigit yearoveryear declines in equipment sales during the quarter as customers cancelled or delayed purchases the declines in equipment sales more than offset the sales growth from consumables and services experienced throughout the majority of 2008 in addition sales in the integrated scanning system product line declined throughout 2008 due to lower capital expenditures by the united states postal service and the timing of completion of various large projects for other large parcel post and retail customers 

motion sales in the segment’s motion businesses representing approximately 34 of segment sales in 2008 increased 40 over 2007 sales from existing businesses accounted for 10 growth while currency translation accounted for 30 growth during 2008 there were no acquisitions in the motion businesses in 2008 or 2007 

sales growth from existing businesses during 2008 was primarily driven by demand for custom motors and drives particularly in the elevator application flat panel display and aerospace and defense end markets largely offsetting this growth was weakness in demand for the business’ standard motors and drives product offerings throughout the year and in particular during the fourth quarter primarily in north america and europe in addition during the fourth quarter demand for products supporting the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets as well as other industrial applications declined at levels in excess of the declines experienced during the first nine months of the year 

focused niche businesses  revenues in the segment’s existing niche businesses grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2008 as compared to 2007 driven primarily by highsingle digit sales growth in the segment’s aerospace and defense businesses and lowsingle digit sales growth in the segment’s sensors and controls businesses sales growth from the sensors and controls business primarily occurred during the first nine months of 2008 as demand weakened during the fourth quarter resulting in essentially flat segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the comparable period of 2007

 components of sales growth decline 

 

 2009 compared to 2008 

sales declined in both the mechanics’ hand tools business and the segment’s niche businesses during 2009 as compared to 2008 price increases did not appreciably impact segment results during 2009 

operating profit margins in the segment were 40 basis points lower during 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from 130 basis points of incremental yearoveryear restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008 in addition a gain recorded in 2008 from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a 2007 plant fire adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons lower yearoveryear average commodity costs cost savings attributable to the company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and improved productivity in the business’ manufacturing facilities partially offset these negative yearoveryear factors 

overview of businesses within the tools  components segment 

mechanics’ hand tools sales from existing businesses representing approximately 75 of segment sales declined 11 during 2009 as compared to 2008 the yearoveryear decline in sales is primarily a result of generally weak north american demand in the retail industrial and mobile tool markets relating to general economic conditions modest growth in the china domestic market during 2009 partially offset weak north american demand 

sales in the segment’s niche businesses declined approximately 35 during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to weak end market demand while demand was weak throughout 2009 the rate of sales decline during the second half of 2009 was not as pronounced as the rate of sales decline in the first half of 2009 in part because of easier yearoveryear comparisons as these businesses began experiencing revenue declines in mid2008 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

price increases accounted for approximately 20 sales growth on a yearoveryear basis which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses 

the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the tools and components segment by 30 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007 elevated commodity costs and lower overall sales volumes in the mechanics’ hand tools business also adversely impacted operating profit margins a 2008 gain from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a 2007 plant fire coupled with the impact of charges recorded in 2007 associated with the fire favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points commodity costs declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 

overview of businesses within the tools  components segment 

mechanics’ hand tools sales representing approximately 69 of segment sales in 2008 declined 55 in 2008 compared to 2007 sales from existing businesses declined 60 during 2008 offset by a 05 positive impact as a result of foreign currency translation the sales decline is primarily attributable to weak north american demand in both the retail mobile and industrial hand tools end markets partially offsetting the weak north american demand was sales growth in the asian market primarily in the first half of 2008 as the rate of growth in the region slowed during the second half of the year 

the segment’s niche businesses experienced a modest sales increase during 2008 as compared to 2007 higher customer demand in the segment’s engine retarder business which rebounded from the impact of regulatory changes that resulted in reduced 2007 sales levels were largely offset by lower demand in the segment’s other niche businesses during year with particularly lower demand in the fourth quarter 

gross profit 

 

 gross profit margins for 2009 increased 40 basis points from 2008 cost savings related to 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities primarily drove the yearoveryear improvements in gross profit margin from 2008 to 2009 lower yearoveryear commodity costs also contributed to the improvement as costs for several types of raw materials increased sharply in 2008 before declining late in 2008 and into 2009 lower overall sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008 diminished the leverage of the company’s fixed cost base and partially offset these positive factors in addition costs incurred associated with yearoveryear incremental 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted gross profit margins by 65 basis points 

gross profit margins for 2008 increased 110 basis points from 2007 included in the 2008 gross profit margins is 33 million 25 basis points of restructuring and other related costs the increase in gross profit margins over 2007 is primarily a result of leverage on increased sales volume particularly in highermargin consumable oriented businesses the impact of costsaving initiatives that began in late 2007 and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired primarily tektronix the impact on gross margins of higher commodity costs prevalent through the majority of 2008 was partially mitigated by price increases implemented throughout the company 

  

operating expenses 

 

 the yearoveryear increases in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to reduced leverage of the company’s cost base caused by lower sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008 incremental yearoveryear costs associated with 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales by 50 basis points on a yearoveryear basis although the 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions have generated yearoveryear cost savings that partially offset these negative factors 

research and development expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales were flat during 2009 as compared to 2008 the company continues to invest in new product development within all of its businesses with particular emphasis on the medical technologies test and measurement environmental and product identification businesses 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2008 increased 170 basis points from 2007 included in the 2008 selling general and administrative expenses is 49 million 40 basis points of restructuring and other related costs other increases in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are primarily associated with recently acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures increased spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the company particularly in emerging markets also contributed to the growth as a percentage of sales 

research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately 20 basis points higher in 2008 as compared to 2007 the 2007 charge for acquired inprocess research and development related to the tektronix acquisition as described below impacted yearoveryear comparisons by 75 basis points the relatively higher research and development cost structures of recently acquired businesses primarily tektronix and higher investment in research and development in the medical technologies segment were the primary drivers of these yearoveryear increases 

interest expense and income 

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness please refer to “–liquidity and capital resources – financing activities and indebtedness” below 

interest expense of 123 million in 2009 was 75 million lower than 2008 primarily as a result of lower average debt levels during 2009 as the company deployed cash flows to repay a portion of its commercial paper borrowings interest attributable to the 750 million principal amount of 540 senior unsecured notes issued in march 2009 as discussed below partially offset the positive impact of the reduction in outstanding commercial paper borrowings interest expense of 130 million in 2008 was approximately 20 million higher than 2007 as a result of higher average debt levels during 2008 primarily as a result of borrowings incurred in the fourth quarter 2007 to fund the acquisition of tektronix 

the company recognized interest income of 5 million 10 million and 6 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively interest income in 2009 was lower than interest income in 2008 as the lower interest rates on deposits 

  

in 2009 compared to 2008 more than offset higher average invested cash balances interest income during 2008 was higher than during 2007 as a result of higher average invested cash balances as less cash was deployed for acquisitions during 2008 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company’s financial statements the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws the company’s effective tax rate for 2009 differs from the united states federal statutory rate of 35 primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the united states no provisions for united states income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states the amount of united states income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings as of december 31 2009 the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately 65 billion 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit reserves are adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

yearoveryear changes in tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 was 192 247 and 258 respectively 

the company’s 2009 effective tax rate of 192 includes the impact of approximately 972 million or 029 per diluted share related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with the resolution of uncertain tax positions and discrete items the impact of expensing transaction costs in accordance with the new business combination accounting standard much of which are not deductible for income tax purposes partially offset these beneficial factors 

the company’s 2008 effective tax rate of 247 includes the impact of approximately 95 million or 003 per diluted share related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with uncertain tax positions and discrete items recorded primarily during the second quarter the effective tax rate also reflects the impact of the continued growth in earnings outside of the united states refer to note 14 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the effective tax rate for 2010 is expected to be approximately 25 

  

inflation 

the effect of broad based inflation on the company’s operations was not significant in the twelve months ended december 31 2009 2008 or 2007 

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 

interest rate risk 

a change in interest rates on longterm debt is assumed to impact the fair value of the company’s longterm debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on the company’s longterm debt is fixed as of december 31 2009 an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock by approximately 120 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity 

a change in interest rates on shortterm debt impacts our earnings and cash flow but not the fair value of the company’s shortterm debt instruments because of their limited duration as of december 31 2009 the company’s shortterm debt obligations relate primarily to us dollar commercial paper borrowings and as a result its primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2009 as these obligations mature the company anticipates issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings in 2009 a 50 increase in average market interest rates on the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 04 million a 50 hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2009 

currency exchange rate risk 

the company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries net of the translation effect of the eurobonds is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive income” component of stockholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at december 31 2009 net of the translation effect of the company’s eurobond notes as described below would result in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 500 million 

the company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred and sales are generated in foreign currencies costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively 

  

on average the us dollar strengthened against other major currencies during 2009 as a result currency exchange rates decreased reported sales for 2009 by approximately 20 as compared to reported sales for 2008 the impact of currency exchange rates on reported sales on a yearoveryear basis was more significant in the first half of 2009 as the us dollar weakened against other major currencies during the second half of 2009 and ended the year at exchange rates lower than existed as of december 31 2008 if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2009 prevail throughout 2010 currency exchange rates will positively impact 2010 reported sales and operating results relative to the company’s performance in 2009 additional weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would have a further positive impact on the company’s reported sales and results of operations any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements the eurobond notes described below which as of december 31 2009 had outstanding borrowings in principal amount equivalent to 716 million provide a natural hedge to a portion of the company’s european net asset position 

credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments and trade accounts receivable the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities 

the company’s ability to access the commercial paper market and the other capital markets has not been affected adversely by the recent uncertainty in the financial markets the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its cash flow and other sources of liquidity primarily its commercial paper program and committed credit facility will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions and maintain its capital structure on a short and longterm basis for a discussion of risks related to the uncertainty in the financial markets and the global economy in general please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

 operating activities 

the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes restructuring activities pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately 18 billion for 2009 a decrease of 58 million or approximately 3 as compared to 2008 the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the decrease in earnings in 2009 as compared to 2008 and to a lesser extent attributable to the yearoveryear incremental amount of cash paid related to the company’s restructuring activities in addition the company voluntarily contributed 60 million to the company’s us defined benefit pension plan in 2009 while it made no contribution in 2008 the declines in operating cash flow were partially offset by improvements in operating working capital defined by the company as trade accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable which contributed 228 million of cash flow during 2009 as compared to contributing 108 million of cash flow during 2008 operating working capital in 2009 benefited from increased collections of accounts receivable and reduced inventory levels associated with lower levels of business activity partially offset by reductions in accounts payable as compared to 2008 a decline of approximately 100 million in tax payments during 2009 as compared to 2008 also partially offset the decline in operating cash flow 

operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately 19 billion for 2008 an increase of 160 million or approximately 95 as compared to 2007 earnings growth of 104 million in addition to an increase of approximately 39 million in contributions from operating working capital as compared to 2007 contributed to the overall yearoveryear increase in operating cash flows the 2008 operating working capital contribution increased primarily due to strong collections of accounts receivable operating cash flows during 2008 also benefited approximately 83 million from yearoveryear increases in stock compensation depreciation and amortization charges which did not require the use of cash in addition noncash acquisition related charges incurred related to acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue in connection with the 2007 acquisition of tektronix had a positive impact on operating cash flow comparisons approximately 100 million of additional income tax payments made in 2008 related to continuing operations as compared to 2007 partially offset these positive factors 

in connection with the company’s restructuring activities the company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing facilities severing personnel and in connection with acquisitions integrating the acquired businesses into existing company operations cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals during 2009 the company paid approximately 161 million related to its 2009 and 2008 restructuring activities and approximately 28 million related to restructuring activities associated with acquisitions completed prior to december 31 2008 please refer to note 2 and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these expenditures 

  

investing activities

net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was approximately 567 million in 2008 compared to approximately 34 billion in 2007 gross capital spending increased 32 million in 2008 from 2007 levels to 194 million 

as discussed below the company completed numerous business acquisitions and divestitures during 2009 2008 and 2007 all of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the company’s financial statements this goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses the multiple to earnings cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers the competitive nature of the process by which the company acquired the business and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations for a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

 for a discussion of the company’s debt as of december 31 2009 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt except in connection with the change of control provisions described as follows under each of the eurobond notes the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes if the company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control the company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of the 2018 notes and 2019 notes or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of eurobond notes the company’s outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and saleleaseback transactions none of these covenants are considered restrictive to the company’s operations and as of december 31 2009 the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants for a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

commercial paper program and credit facility 

the company satisfies its shortterm liquidity needs primarily through issuances of us dollar and euro commercial paper under the company’s us dollar and euro commercial paper programs the company or a subsidiary of the company as applicable may issue and sell unsecured shortterm promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40 billion since the credit facilities described below provide credit support for the program the 1525 billion of availability under the credit facilities has the practical effect of reducing from 40 billion to 1525 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the company can issue under the program commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes including financing acquisitions the company classifies the borrowings under the commercial paper program as longterm borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the company has the intent and the ability as supported by the availability of the credit facility to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date 

credit support for part of the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured 145 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility the “credit facility” that expires on april 25 2012 and an unsecured 75 million multicurrency revolving credit facility that expires on may 3 2010 the “supplemental credit facility” and together with the credit facility the “credit facilities” the credit facilities can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes under the credit facility interest is based on at the company’s option 1 a liborbased formula that is dependent in part on the company’s credit rating 2 a formula based on the higher as of the date of determination of bank of america’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or 3 the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility under the supplemental credit facility interest is based on at the company’s option 1 a liborbased formula or 2 a formula based on the highest as of the date of determination of the lender’s prime rate the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or the libor rate plus 100 basis points both of the credit facilities require the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity as of the last day of each quarter of 065 to 100 or less as of december 31 2009 the company was in compliance with this covenant the availability of the credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of our commercial paper program we expect to limit any borrowings under the credit facilities to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it matures the company anticipates seeking a renewal of the term of the supplemental credit facility from the lender prior to its scheduled expiration 

  

during 2009 the company refinanced balances under its commercial paper program as they came due to maintain an outstanding balance throughout the year during 2008 the company utilized its commercial paper program to finance the repayment of the company’s 61 notes that matured in october 2008 amounts outstanding under the company’s us dollar commercial paper program as of december 31 2009 had a weighted average interest rate of 02 and an average maturity of approximately 5 days 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions any downgrade in the company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program and credit facility and could limit or preclude the company’s ability to issue commercial paper if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available operating cash flow and our credit facilities to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings

in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company’s products or claims alleging that company products infringe thirdparty intellectual property the company cannot estimate its maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions and has not accrued any liabilities in its consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in our contractual commitments table above historically the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

the company’s certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher has executed with each of its directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

  

legal proceedings

in addition to the litigation matters noted under “item 1 business – regulatory matters – environmental health  safety” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition related matters the company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages based upon the company’s experience current information and applicable law it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows financial position or results of operations 

while the company maintains workers’ compensation property cargo automobile aviation crime fiduciary product general liability and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions that it believes cover a portion of these claims this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses in addition while the company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses the company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts for general liability risk which includes product liability and most other insured risks the company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the selfinsured retention 

the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable the company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and if appropriate recognizes a reserve for these contingencies these reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk insurance professionals where appropriate in addition outside risk insurance professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known while the company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of december 31 2009 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate if the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the amount of our accruals for selfinsurance and litigation liability

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments 

the company believes the following accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies refer to note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments the company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the company’s customers and the company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers the uncertain conditions in the global economy and credit markets have heightened the uncertainties related to customers’ ability to pay if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates and impair their ability to make payments the company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control as a result such fluctuations can be difficult to predict if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur in accordance with accounting standards related to business combinations goodwill amortization ceased effective january 1 2002 however amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets primarily consisting of customer relationships and acquired technology continues over the estimated useful lives of the identified asset the company is required on at least an annual basis the first day of the company’s fiscal fourth quarter to calculate the fair value of each of its reporting units and compare the calculated fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value this is an impairment indicator which necessitates additional analysis to determine if the reporting unit’s goodwill has been impaired if circumstances or events occur prior to the date of the required annual assessment that indicate the potential diminution of fair value of a reporting unit the company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such change in circumstance or event the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach the company estimates fair value based on ebitda multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company’s reporting units in addition to market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including recent operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and other market data the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach in order to validate the results of the market approach in certain circumstances once completed the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth 

  

future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of december 31 2009 the company had 27 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of the goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranges from approximately 5 million to approximately 2 billion the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2009 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the first day of the company’s fiscal fourth quarter the annual testing date ranged from approximately 3 to approximately 529 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company identified three reporting units with an aggregate 26 billion carrying value of goodwill that have a reporting unit carrying value that would exceed fair value if the fair value of those reporting units decreased 10 on an aggregate basis the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for these three reporting units is 65 the application of the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value for these three reporting units would result in an aggregate shortfall in fair value of 38 as compared to the aggregate carrying value of these three reporting units 

longlived assets  the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets were impaired the company would be required to recognize a charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value in determining the fair value of longlived assets the company makes judgments relating to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets factors that impact these judgments include the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in the expected use of the assets changes in economic conditions changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates longlived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and the company would need to take a charge against net earnings 

contingent liabilities  as discussed above under “—legal proceedings” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liability estimates may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the company’s settlement strategy if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

revenue recognition  the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of products and services for revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition there must be persuasive evidence of a sale delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured the company’s standard terms of sale are fob shipping point and as such the company principally records revenue for product sales upon shipment if any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled product returns consist of estimated returns for products sold and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale customer allowances and rebates consisting primarily of volume discounts and 

  

other shortterm incentive programs are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the purchase price product returns customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement 

revenues for contractual arrangements consisting of multiple elements ie deliverables are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists or in the case of software related products vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements requires judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are identifiable as those elements are also sold unaccompanied by other elements 

sharebased compensation  the company accounts for sharebased compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted including stock options restricted stock units “rsus” and restricted shares based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date equitybased compensation expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award in the case of performance based sharebased awards compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated attribution method 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the equitybased compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

pension and other postretirement benefits  certain of the company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans pension plans and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans postretirement plans the company measures its pension and post retirement plans’ assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan the company recognizes an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status in its statement of financial position changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income accounting standards require that the amounts the company records including the expense or income associated with the pension and postretirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations 

calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include discount rates expected return on plan assets rate of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used by the company while the company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the company’s financial position or results of operations for the us plan the company used a 575 discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at december 31 2009 which represents a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate from december 31 2008 for nonus plans rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the us and nonus net obligation by 54 million 37 million on an after tax basis from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2009 

for 2009 the expected longterm rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the united states plan was estimated at 8 which is the same as the rate used in 2008 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation 

  

of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan targets to invest between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds pension expense for the us plan for the year ended december 31 2009 was 3 million or 2 million on an aftertax basis compared with pension benefit of 5 million or 3 million on an aftertax basis for this plan in 2008 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 05 pension expense for 2009 would have increased 5 million or 3 million on an aftertax basis the company made a voluntary contribution of 60 million to the us plan in 2009 the company’s nonus plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 075 to 80 for 2009 and ranged from 15 to 825 for 2008

the following discussions of materials intellectual property competition seasonal nature of business backlog working capital employee relations research and development government contracts regulatory matters international operations and major customers include information common to all of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including steel copper cast iron electronic components aluminum plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some of the components that we use that require particular specifications there may be a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques including the use of alternative materials and qualification of multiple sources of supply to address potential disruption in our supply chain there have been no raw material shortages that have had a material adverse effect on our business as a whole although over the last three years the prices of raw materials have been volatile and for several types of raw materials prices increased substantially in 2007 and 2008 before declining late in 2008 for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time however we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher or its subsidiaries 

competition 

although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the diversity of the products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies that have greater sales marketing research and financial resources than we do we are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product lines but typically include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business as well as price quality delivery speed service and support innovation distribution network and brand name for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and endmarkets that they serve for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products and sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

  

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

backlog 

the table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our four segments at the end of 2008 and 2007  in millions 

 

 we expect that a large majority of unfilled orders will be delivered to customers within 3 to 4 months given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm performance 

employee relations 

at december 31 2008 we employed approximately 50300 persons of which approximately 22100 were employed in the united states of these united states employees approximately 2700 were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements or union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of our employees are represented by unions or works councils while we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

research and development 

the table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate  in millions 

 

   we conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products enhancing the functionality effectiveness ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expanding the applications for 

  

which uses of our products are appropriate our research and development efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position for a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2008 was from customers other than governmental entities we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense product identification water quality motion and mechanics’ hand tool businesses as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

we face comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products and services the following sections describe certain of these regulations 

environmental laws and regulations 

our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with our operations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition to environmental compliance costs we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and nonus environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others previously disposed of hazardous wastes require cleanup and other possible remedial action including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal and state environmental laws and regulations we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have made a provision for environmental investigation and remediation and environmentalrelated personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries we generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with similar sites if the company determines that potential remediation liability for properties currently or previously owned is probable and reasonably estimable it accrues the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site we also estimate our exposure for probable environmentalrelated personal injury claims and accrue for this estimated liability while we actively pursue insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties we do not recognize any recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized 

  

the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the amount of our environmental provisions all provisions have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future third party recoveries for the reasons described above we cannot assure you that our estimates of environmental liabilities will not change 

in view of our financial position and provisions for environmental remediation matters and environmentalrelated personal injury claims and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect we believe that our liability related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow for a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical devices 

certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration the “fda” and by the counterpart agencies of the nonus countries where our products are sold some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the united states 

pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fda regulates virtually all phases of the development manufacture sale and distribution of medical devices including their introduction into interstate commerce manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping pursuant to the fdca and fda regulations certain facilities of our operating subsidiaries are registered with the fda as medical device manufacturing establishments the fda as well as industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization iso regularly inspect our registered andor certified facilities 

we sell both class i and class ii medical devices a medical device whether exempt from or cleared pursuant to the premarket notification requirements of the fdca or approved pursuant to a premarket approval application is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the fda to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements including but not limited to product labeling requirements and limitations including those related to promotion and marketing efforts quality system requirements and medical device adverse event reporting for a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the fda and counterpart agencies of other countries please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

certain of our products utilize radioactive material and we are subject to federal state and local regulations governing the management storage handling and disposal of these materials 

in addition we are subject to various federal state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry including antikickback and false claims laws 

exportimport compliance 

we are required to comply with various exportimport control and economic sanctions laws including 

 

  

   

  

 nonus governments have also implemented similar export and import control regulations which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

our products and services are available worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we believe this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries the table below describes annual revenue derived outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate 

 

 the table below describes longlived assets located outside the united states as a percentage of total longlived assets in each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate 

 

   for additional information related to revenues and longlived assets by country please refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements and for information regarding deferred taxes by geography please refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

the manner in which our products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of our sales in nonus markets are made by subsidiaries located outside the united states though we also sell directly from the us into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors in countries with low sales volumes we generally sell through representatives and distributors 

  

financial information about our international operations is contained in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements and information about the possible effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of risks related to our nonus operations and foreign currency exchange please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as the current global economic slowdown disruption in the financial markets and other us and nonus economic and industry conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism international conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

deteriorating general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global financial markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us financial markets in the united states and abroad have experienced extreme disruption in recent months including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability and declining valuations of investments these disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy a continuing economic downturn and financial market disruptions may 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 in addition although we were able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets throughout 2008 there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these financial market and general economic developments and they could have a material adverse effect on our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility and borrow money in the credit markets or otherwise or on the terms of such borrowings 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors we are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services designed to maintain our brand recognition and leadership position in various product categories and penetrating new markets including in developing countries our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues profitability and cash flow and pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our profitability 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis our products will become technologically obsolete over time and our revenues cash flow profitability and competitive position will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

our growth rate could decline if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could result in diminished demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our growth rate and profitability 

our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course some of which may be material during 2008 we acquired seventeen businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 423 million including transaction costs and net of cash acquired during 2007 we acquired twelve businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 36 billion including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and during 2006 we acquired eleven businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 27 billion including transaction costs and net of cash acquired our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial accounting managerial and operational challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate 

we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations the recent tightening of the credit markets competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory including antitrust approvals changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or further deterioration in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions our ability to grow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings 

  

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters and have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 26 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to incur an additional 826 million of indebtedness in the form of commercial paper or bank loans under our outstanding facilities and programs we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

  

  

 we may incur significantly more debt in the future if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets and requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of 065 to 10 or less in addition our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our longlived assets 

at december 31 2008 the net carrying value of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill other intangible assets and other long term assets totaled approximately 133 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess our longlived assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other longlived assets future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices and also decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices likewise decreased strength of the us dollar could have 

  

a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas in addition our sales and expenses are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into us dollars 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our operations the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not provide us a significant competitive advantage in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons our failure or inability to obtain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in the event of a successful claim against us we could lose our rights to critical technology or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights any of which could adversely impact our competitive position revenues profitability and cash flows even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisitionrelated matters some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition operations and results of operations moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures in addition developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements which could adversely affect our results of operations in any period 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the us and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

in addition to the environmental regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the federal state and local levels including the following 

 

  

  

 in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to manufacture import and export products and services and damage to our reputation our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the iso and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” 

  

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery competition money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various nonus jurisdictions our effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions and tax planning strategies changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and changes in tax laws any of these factors may adversely affect our tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows the recent volatility in global capital markets has resulted in significant declines in the fair value of our pension plan assets during 2008 

we have experienced and may continue to experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of rising prices for commodities 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including steel copper cast iron electronic components aluminum plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities over the last three years the prices of raw materials have been volatile for several types of raw materials prices increased substantially in 2007 and 2008 before declining late in 2008 due to the highly competitive nature of the industries which we serve and the costcontainment efforts of our customers we may be unable to fully pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable fully to recover higher raw material costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our purchases of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changing market conditions or customer demand our income and results of operations may suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

  

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we could face manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity to reflect the demand for our products our income and results of operations may suffer 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed our production requirements or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as health and safety environmental and food and drug regulations and regulations governing communications we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations in these markets the failure of governmental and other entities to adopt new regulations or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect our growth rate in addition certain of our customers receive reimbursement from government insurance programs for some of the costs of the products that they purchase from us a reduction in governmental support for healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare services may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs 

we have a number of us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition or performance of key distributors resellers and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors resellers and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition or performance could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  for example the recent economic downturn and financial market disruption has increased the possibility that one or more of our significant customers or a group of less significant customers could become insolvent which could result in uncollectible accounts receivable in excess of established reserves preference actions that would require us to repay to the bankruptcy estate payments recently received from such customer increased obsolete inventory and impairment of longlived assets due to underutilized manufacturing capacity in addition the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare could adversely impact our profitability 

  

the inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified officers and other employees we may not be able to 

 

  

  

 international economic political legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in 2008 approximately 53 of our sales were derived outside the us since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us we expect to continue to increase our sales outside the us particularly in emerging markets in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the us our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and growth 

cyclical economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our businesses operate in industries that have historically experienced periodic downturns which have adversely impacted demand for the equipment and services that we manufacture and market any competitive pricing pressures slowdown in capital investments or other downturn in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period 

if we suffer loss to our facilities distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is designed to provide a reader of danaher corporation’s “danaher” “company” “we” “us” “our” financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of company management the company’s mda is divided into four main sections 

 

  

  

  

 overview 

general 

we strive to create shareholder value through 

 

  

  

 to accomplish these goals we use a set of tools and processes known as the danaher business system which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality delivery cost and innovation within the dbs framework we pursue a number of ongoing strategic initiatives intended to improve our performance including initiatives relating to manufacturing improvement idea generation product development and commercialization and global sourcing of materials and services to further these objectives we also acquire businesses that either strategically fit within our existing business portfolio or expand our portfolio into a new and attractive business area we believe that many acquisition opportunities remain available within our target markets the extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and effectively integrated can affect our overall growth and operating results we also continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment 

danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations in 2008 approximately 53 of danaher’s sales were derived outside the united states as a global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors for example in those industry segments where the company is a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the company’s customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of its product sales and services typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results however the broad impact of the worldwide credit market turmoil and economic downturn have negatively impacted the growth rates of most of the company’s businesses and resulted in the company’s overall revenue from existing businesses contracting in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year fourth quarter 

given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future in addition the company’s order rates are highly indicative of the company’s revenue in the short term and thus a key measure of anticipated performance 

significant acquisitions 

in november 2007 the company significantly expanded its test and measurement business with the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of tektronix inc for total cash consideration of approximately 28 billion including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired tektronix is part of danaher’s test and measurement business 

  

included in the professional instrumentation segment the company funded the purchase price of the tektronix acquisition with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and the company’s november 2007 common stock offering and to a lesser extent from available cash 

business performance 

while differences exist among the company’s businesses the company experienced overall growth during 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of the deterioration in global economic conditions that occurred in the latter part of 2008 all of the yearoveryear growth from existing businesses experienced by the company occurred in the first nine months of the year demand weakened significantly in the fourth quarter resulting in a decline in revenue from existing businesses in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 notwithstanding the fourth quarter decline the company’s full year growth was led by strength throughout the entire year in the company’s environmental acute care diagnostic and life sciences businesses growth from the test and measurement business during the first nine months of 2008 was partially offset by sales declines experienced in the fourth quarter due to weak demand sales growth was also impacted adversely in the fourth quarter 2008 due to weak demand in the company’s industrial and consumer oriented businesses as demand slowed considerably in the dental technologies product identification enterprise network performance management and mechanics’ hand tools businesses 

the company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and geographies served the company’s future performance will depend on its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies served including contraction in most of the world’s major economies access to funding in the global capital markets trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force consolidation of competitors the expansion of market opportunities in asia and volatility in raw material costs the company regularly evaluates market needs and conditions with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner consistent with this approach and in light of the worsening global economic environment the company initiated a series of restructuring actions during the fourth quarter of 2008 to better position the company’s cost base for future periods please refer to “results of operations—restructuring and other related charges” below for additional discussion 

although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes a substantial portion of its sales and profits are generated in foreign currencies sales and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates with limited exceptions the company has accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements please refer to “financial instruments and risk management” section below for additional information 

on average the us dollar weakened against other major currencies during 2008 particularly during the first half of 2008 the us dollar strengthened against other major currencies in the second half of 2008 and as of december 31 2008 us dollar exchange rate levels were stronger than as of the end of 2007 currency exchange rates increased reported sales for 2008 by approximately 20 as compared to 2007 given the lower overall profit margins in the company’s european businesses currency rate changes lowered yearoveryear comparisons of reported operating profit margins if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2008 prevail throughout 2009 currency exchange rates will adversely impact 2009 sales and operating results relative to the company’s performance in 2008 additional strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the company’s sales and results of operations any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would benefit the company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis 

  

outlook 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 worldwide credit markets and overall global economic conditions deteriorated significantly resulting in a general decline in worldwide demand for the company’s products and services the economic uncertainties that continue to exist suggest that global demand will continue to contract at least in the early months of 2009 while none of the company’s businesses are insulated from the slowing demand the contraction is anticipated to impact adversely certain of the company’s businesses more than others in particular the company’s industrial and consumer businesses are likely to be most impacted with the medical technologies and environmental businesses less affected the company expects further contraction in the industrial technologies and tools and components segments as well as portions of the test and measurement businesses to minimize the impact of the recessionary economic conditions as discussed below the company initiated restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 and will continue to assess market conditions and take actions as it deems necessary to appropriately position its businesses in light of the economic environment the company currently estimates additional pretax restructuring costs in the range of 40 to 60 million to be incurred during 2009 consistent with past practice the company will also continue to actively manage working capital with a view to maximizing cash flow 

although recent distress in the financial markets has not had a significant impact on the company’s financial position or liquidity as of the filing date of this report management continues to monitor the financial markets and general global economic conditions if further changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely affect the company’s access to the commercial paper markets the company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and existing committed credit facilities to provide shortterm funding please refer to the “liquidity and capital resources” section for additional discussion 

results of operations 

consolidated sales from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2008 increased 150 over the comparable period of 2007 sales from existing businesses contributed 25 growth acquisitions contributed 105 growth and currency translation provided 20 growth the majority of the growth related to currency translation occurred during the first nine months of 2008 as currency translation adversely impacted results in the fourth quarter of 2008 references in this report to sales from existing businesses include sales from acquired businesses starting from and after the first anniversary of the acquisition but exclude currency effect 

the growth in sales from acquisitions in the year ended december 31 2008 is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of chemtreat in july 2007 and tektronix in november 2007 both of which are included in the professional instrumentation segment the acquisitions of other smaller businesses in the medical technologies professional instrumentation and industrial technologies segments also contributed to the yearoveryear growth the company acquired seventeen businesses and twelve businesses during the year ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

operating profit margins from continuing operations for the company were 147 in the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 158 for the year ended december 31 2007 charges recorded related to the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities reduced the company’s 2008 operating profit margins by 65 basis points in addition the dilutive impact of acquisitions reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 80 basis points including the adverse impact of 60 million 45 million or 013 per diluted share net of tax of acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue fair value charges recorded related to the acquisition of tektronix the company also incurred tektronix related charges in 2007 associated with acquired inprocess research and development that affected yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points a gain recorded in the second quarter of 2007 from the collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit also affected yearoveryear comparisons of operating profit margins by 10 basis points 

  

restructuring and other related charges 

in light of the worsening global economic environment the company initiated a series of restructuring actions during the fourth quarter of 2008 to better position the company’s cost base for future periods as a result the company recorded pretax restructuring and other related charges totaling 820 million 615 million net of tax or 018 per diluted share as indicated in the following table  in thousands 

 

 the restructuring and other related charges are intended to improve future operational efficiency through targeted workforce reductions and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures approximately 93 of the total pretax charges require cash payments which are being funded with cash generated from operations through december 31 2008 approximately 20 million of required cash payments had been made the majority of the remaining cash expenditures are expected to occur in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of these restructuring activities the company expects recurring pretax savings to exceed 100 million during 2009 

the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities resulted in net workforce reductions of approximately 1800 associates and thirteen facility closures the majority of which have been completed as of december 31 2008 remaining workforce reductions and facility closure activities associated with the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities to be completed during 2009 are not significant in conjunction with the closing of facilities certain inventory was written off as unusable in future operating locations this inventory consisted principally of component parts and raw materials which were either redundant to inventory at the facilities being merged or were not economically feasible to relocate since the inventory was purchased to operate on equipment and tooling which was not being relocated in addition property plant and equipment at closed facilities were evaluated based on expected future use and written down to fair value where impairments were identified 

in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings the pretax restructuring and related charges consisting of 76 million cash charges and 6 million noncash charges are reflected in the following captions  in thousands 

 

 the impact of these restructuring and related charges in each of the company’s segments is discussed in the following analysis of the segment results of operations

 components of sales growth 

 

 2008 compared to 2007 

segment sales for professional instrumentation increased 375 for 2008 as compared to 2007 sales growth was experienced in both of the segment’s strategic lines of business during the year with the majority of the growth coming from acquisitions price increases accounted for approximately 20 sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses 

  

fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the professional instrumentation segment by 60 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007 in addition the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 295 basis points including the adverse impact of acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue fair value charges recorded related to the acquisition of tektronix which charges will not recur in 2009 the company also incurred tektronixrelated charges in 2007 associated with acquired inprocess research and development that affected yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 170 basis points 

depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the tektronix acquisition 

overview of businesses within professional instrumentation segment 

environmental  sales from the company’s environmental businesses representing approximately 51 of segment sales for 2008 increased 155 in 2008 compared to 2007 sales from existing businesses accounted for 65 growth while acquisitions accounted for 75 growth and currency translation accounted for 15 growth 

the segment’s water quality businesses experienced highsingle digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007 this growth was primarily a result of strong laboratory and process sales reflecting in part the results of increased sales force investments and penetration into emerging markets growth in sales was experienced in all major geographic regions with particular strength in asia where sales increased at a double digit rate also contributing to the yearoveryear growth was increased demand by municipalities for the businesses’ ultraviolet disinfection water treatment product offerings which experienced a midteens sales growth rate 

the retail petroleum equipment business experienced midsingle digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007 this growth was primarily driven by strong sales of payment and point of sale retail and payment solution product offerings offset by a decline in dispensing equipment sales primarily in north america and europe an increase in demand for the business’ vapor recovery products in north america also contributed to the yearoveryear sales growth primarily related to an enhanced vapor recovery product that received regulatory approval and launched during the fourth quarter of 2008 

test and measurement  sales from the company’s test and measurement businesses representing approximately 49 of segment sales for 2008 grew 70 compared to 2007 sales from existing businesses were essentially flat while acquisitions accounted for 680 growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 20 growth 

sales growth from existing businesses was driven primarily by performance during the first nine months of 2008 as a result of strong sales of the business’ thermography and precision measurement product offerings as well as strong growth from investments in emerging markets while demand for the business’ thermography products continued to increase as compared to 2007 during the fourth quarter demand slowed for the business’ traditional industrial digital handheld instruments and precision measurement products resulting in a midsingle digit rate sales decline in the quarter and offsetting the growth experienced in the first nine months in addition the sales decline in the fourth quarter is a result of reductions of inventory in the distribution channel as well as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility on customer demand in certain emerging markets sales also declined throughout 2008 in the business’ enterprise network performance management line of business as a result of generally lower telecommunications demand and slower information technology spending by customers 

2007 compared to 2006 

segment sales for professional instrumentation increased 220 for 2007 compared to 2006 sales from existing businesses increased in both of the segment’s strategic lines of business price increases accounted for approximately 15 sales growth and the impact of that increase is reflected in sales from existing businesses 

  

operating profit margins were 201 in 2007 compared to 215 in 2006 operating profit margin improvements of 135 basis points related to existing businesses were more than offset by the dilutive impact of lower operating profit margins of acquired businesses which reduced segment operating profit margins by 260 basis points compared to 2006 included in the dilutive impact on operating margins from acquired businesses is approximately 68 million 185 basis points in charges associated with the acquisition of tektronix primarily related to acquired inprocess research and development activities acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue in addition year over year comparisons are impacted by a gain on the sale of real estate during 2006 and recovery of certain previously writtenoff receivables during 2006 which increased that period’s operating profit margins by 15 basis points leverage on increased sales volume in 2008 contributed positively to overall professional instrumentation operating profit margins 

overview of businesses within professional instrumentation segment 

environmental  sales from the company’s environmental businesses representing approximately 60 of segment sales for 2007 increased 165 in 2007 compared to 2006 sales from existing businesses accounted for 60 growth acquisitions accounted for 70 growth and currency translation accounted for 35 growth 

the company’s water quality businesses experienced lowdouble digit revenue growth for 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of strength in sales of laboratory and process instrumentation products in all major geographic regions in addition sales of the company’s ultraviolet water treatment systems grew doubledigit compared to 2006 investment in sales forces and other growth initiatives in addition to continued penetration of the asian wastewater market including a significant reclamation project in australia contributed to the growth sales growth from acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of chemtreat in july 2007 

the retail petroleum equipment business experienced lowsingle digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006 the business’ point of sale payment systems and service business enjoyed robust growth in 2007 primarily in europe in addition the business experienced strong demand during 2007 in north america and china for its leak detection systems that were introduced during the period these sales gains were offset by difficult prior year comparisons a result of strong dispenser sales in 2006 due to extensive refurbishment activity in europe and regulatory mandates in mexico that did not repeat in 2007 

test and measurement  sales from the company’s test and measurement businesses representing approximately 40 of segment sales for 2007 grew 315 compared to 2006 sales from existing businesses accounted for 80 growth acquisitions accounted for 200 growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 35 growth 

new product offerings in the thermography power quality test and process calibration markets generated strong sales in the electrical and industrial channels in all major geographical areas during 2007 the network test business experienced midsingle digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006 large orders from telecommunications carriers in the united states during the first three quarters of 2007 and cable test equipment sales in europe were the primary drivers of the network test growth acquisition growth was primarily related to the acquisition of tektronix in addition to several smaller acquisitions throughout the year

 components of sales growth 

 

 2008 compared to 2007 

segment sales for medical technologies increased 95 for 2008 as compared to 2007 sales growth was primarily driven by the segment’s acute care diagnostics life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses price increases accounted for approximately 10 sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses 

the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the medical technologies segment by 80 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007 in addition the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 40 basis points a decline in demand for certain products in the dental technologies business in addition to increased sales force investment and research and development costs within the life sciences business also adversely impacted yearoveryear operating margin profit comparisons 

overview of businesses within medical technologies segment 

revenues in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at midsingle digit rate in 2008 as compared to 2007 the yearoveryear growth was primarily attributable to strong aftermarket consumables sales for the business installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation sales of the business’ compact version of its blood gas analysis instrument as well as sales resulting from the launch of the business’ aqt cardiac marker during 2008 sales growth was experienced in all major geographic regions during the year particularly strong growth in emerging markets during the first nine months of the year moderated during the fourth quarter as a result of currency exchange rate volatility and economic uncertainty 

the segment’s life science instrumentation business experienced highsingle digit revenue growth in 2008 as compared to 2007 continued strong sales of the business’ pathology diagnostics instrumentation and consumables offerings as well as compound microscopy product offerings drove the majority of this growth all major geographic regions experienced growth the acquisition of surgipath medical industries in the fourth quarter of 2008 is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the pathology diagnostics business 

  

the segment’s dental business’ revenue in 2008 was essentially flat as compared to 2007 revenues in the dental technologies business grew at a midsingle digit rate through the first nine months of 2008 primarily driven by strong demand for imaging equipment however a significant decline in demand in the fourth quarter for the majority of the products in the dental technologies’ business including imaging equipment more than offset this earlier growth resulting in lowsingle digit sales declines for the year the decline in demand is primarily attributable to customer decisions to cancel or delay capital spending as well as inventory reductions in certain distribution channels offsetting the 2008 sales declines in the dental technologies business was lowsingle digit growth in the dental consumables business sales growth in the dental consumables’ businesses was primarily due to strong sales of general dentistry consumables and increased demand for endodontic and infection control products offset by lower demand in the orthodontia product line 

2007 compared to 2006 

segment sales increased 35 for 2007 compared to 2006 price increases which are included in sales from existing businesses contributed 10 to overall sales growth in 2007 compared to 2006 

operating profit margin improvements in the segment’s existing businesses contributed 100 basis points to the overall operating margin improvement in 2007 improvements in the operating profit margins of the dental consumable acute care diagnostic and life sciences instrumentation businesses were partially offset by lower operating profit margins in the dental equipment businesses recently acquired businesses adversely impacted 2007 operating profit margins by 40 basis points as compared to 2006 in addition on a comparative basis 2007 operating margins benefited approximately 50 basis points from the adverse impact on 2006 operating margins that resulted from charges recorded associated with the fair value of acquired inventory related to the acquisition of sybron 

overview of businesses within medical technologies segment 

the segment’s acute care diagnostics business experienced highsingle digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006 increasing sales of diagnostic instruments in europe particularly russia in 2007 contributed to this sales growth the north american and asiapacific markets also contributed to the growth although at somewhat lower rates than those experienced in the european markets new product introductions resulting from the business’ continued research and development efforts also contributed to this growth 

the segment’s life science instrumentation business experienced midteens revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006 robust microscopy demand particularly confocal microscopes in north america and asia were the primary growth drivers the integration of vision with leica microsystems was completed in 2007 and generated incremental revenue growth the majority of which has been included as a component of acquisition growth during 2007 vision’s revenue grew approximately 30 in 2007 compared to 2006 when it was a standalone company 

the segment’s dental business experienced midsingle digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006 the business experienced increased sales volumes in its restorative and orthodontia products as well as in the instrument and treatment unit product offerings across all major geographies in addition increased sales of both twodimensional and threedimensional imaging products contributed to the revenue growth in the european market this growth was partially offset by a decline in instrument and treatment unit sales to asia reflecting a weak overall japanese market and the need to reregister certain products with regulatory authorities in south korea 

industrial technologies 

businesses in the industrial technologies segment manufacture products and subsystems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines as well as incorporated by original equipment manufacturers oems into various endproducts many of the businesses also provide services to support their products including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime the industrial technologies segment encompasses two strategic lines of business motion and product 

  

identification and two focused niche businesses aerospace and defense and sensors and controls these businesses produce and sell product identification equipment and consumables motion position speed temperature and level instruments and sensing devices liquid flow and quality measuring devices aerospace safety devices and defense articles and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices in the third quarter of 2007 the company disposed of the power quality businesses that were part of this segment and all 2007 and 2006 results of the segment have been adjusted to exclude the results of these discontinued operations

 components of sales growth 

 

 2008 compared to 2007 

segment sales for industrial technologies increased 35 for 2008 as compared to 2007 sales growth experienced for the majority of the year in the segment’s motion and niche aerospace and defense and sensors lines of business was partially offset by sales declines experienced in the segment’s product identification line of business primarily in the second half of 2008 price increases accounted for approximately 20 sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses 

the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the industrial technologies segment by 70 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007 in addition gains recorded in 2007 due to the collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit and from the sale of real estate adversely impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points operating profit margin improvements during 2008 primarily relating to cost savings initiatives implemented beginning in late 2007 partially offset these adverse impacts 

overview of businesses within industrial technologies segment 

motion sales in the segment’s motion businesses representing approximately 34 of segment sales in 2008 increased 40 over 2007 sales from existing businesses accounted for 10 growth while currency translation accounted for 30 growth during 2008 there were no acquisitions in the motion businesses in 2008 or 2007 

  

sales growth from existing businesses during 2008 was primarily driven by demand for custom motors and drives particularly in the elevator application flat panel display and aerospace and defense end markets largely offsetting this growth was weakness in demand for the business’ standard motors and drives product offerings throughout the year and in particular during the fourth quarter primarily in north america and europe in addition during the fourth quarter demand for products supporting the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets as well as other industrial applications declined at levels in excess of the declines experienced during the first nine months of the year 

product identification  the product identification businesses accounted for approximately 27 of segment sales in 2008 sales from the segment’s product identification businesses decreased 15 in 2008 compared to 2007 sales from existing businesses accounted for a 35 decline in sales while currency translation contributed 15 to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 05 to revenue growth in 2008 

through the first nine months of 2008 sales growth driven by increased demand for both consumable products and services associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment had partially offset a decline in equipment sales further weakening of equipment demand during the fourth quarter primarily in north america and europe resulted in doubledigit yearoveryear declines in equipment sales during the quarter as customers cancelled or delayed purchases the declines in equipment sales more than offset the sales growth from consumables and services experienced throughout the majority of 2008 in addition sales in the integrated scanning system product line declined throughout 2008 due to lower capital expenditures by the united states postal service usps and the timing of completion of various large projects for other large parcel post and retail customers 

focused niche businesses  revenues in the segment’s existing niche businesses grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2008 as compared to 2007 driven primarily by highsingle digit sales growth in the segment’s aerospace and defense businesses and lowsingle digit sales growth in the segment’s sensors and controls businesses sales growth from the sensors and controls business primarily occurred during the first nine months of 2008 as demand weakened during the fourth quarter resulting in essentially flat segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the comparable period of 2007 

2007 compared to 2006 

price increases contributed 15 of sales growth compared to 2006 which impact is reflected in sales from existing businesses 

operating profit margin improvements in the segment’s existing businesses contributed 85 basis points to the overall operating margin improvement for 2007 as compared to 2006 this margin improvement was driven in part by continued margin expansion in the motion businesses reflecting pricing and productivity initiatives as well as the impact of lower levels of lowermargin usps sales in 2007 compared to 2006 within the product identification business in addition during 2007 the segment recorded a pretax gain of 12 million upon collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit which improved operating profit margins by 40 basis points for 2007 these positive factors were partially offset by new acquisitions restructuring activities spending for product development and emerging market sales force initiatives 

overview of businesses within industrial technologies segment 

motion sales in the company’s motion businesses representing approximately 34 of segment sales in 2007 increased 25 over 2006 sales from existing businesses accounted for a 10 decrease in sales and currency translation accounted for 35 growth in sales during 2007 there were no acquisitions in the business in 2007 or 2006 

during 2007 the motion business experienced sales growth primarily in the elevator markets as a result of global conversions to more energy efficient systems and new construction demand in asia demand in oem applications in europe also contributed yearoveryear sales growth these growth drivers however were more than offset by yearoveryear sales declines resulting from weakness in certain technology end markets as well as declines in the miniature motors business reflecting reduced customer demand 

  

product identification the product identification businesses accounted for approximately 28 of segment sales in 2007 sales from the company’s product identification businesses increased 35 in 2007 compared to 2006 sales from existing businesses accounted for a 10 decline while currency translation contributed 35 to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 10 to revenue growth in 2007 

the 2007 decline in sales from existing operations resulted from the business completing several large systems installation projects with the usps during 2006 which did not repeat in 2007 sales for the business’ nonusps marking products grew at a midsingle digit rates during 2007 compared to 2006 strong equipment and aftermarket sales particularly in china latin america and europe were the primary drivers of this growth facilitated by increased investments in the business’ sales force and new product launches in these regions 

focused niche businesses the segment’s niche businesses experienced a midsingle digit growth rate in 2007 compared to 2006 this growth was primarily driven by strong sales growth from existing businesses in the company’s aerospace and defense businesses partially offset by sales declines in the company’s sensors and controls business reflecting continued softness in the semiconductor and electronic assembly markets

 components of sales growth 

 

 2008 compared to 2007 

price increases accounted for approximately 20 sales growth on a yearoveryear basis which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses 

  

the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the tools and components segment by 30 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007 elevated commodity costs and lower overall sales volumes in the mechanics’ hand tools business also adversely impacted operating profit margins a 2008 gain from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a 2007 plant fire coupled with the impact of charges recorded in 2007 associated with the fire favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points commodity costs declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and assuming they remain at the current levels will provide a benefit to the segment in 2009 

overview of businesses within the tools  components segment 

mechanics’ hand tools sales representing approximately 69 of segment sales in 2008 declined 55 in 2008 compared to 2007 sales from existing businesses declined 60 during 2008 offset by a 05 positive impact as a result of foreign currency translation the sales decline is primarily attributable to weak north american demand in both the retail mobile and industrial hand tools end markets partially offsetting the weak north american demand was sales growth in the asian market primarily in the first half of 2008 as the rate of growth in the region slowed during the second half of the year 

the segment’s niche businesses experienced a modest sales increase during 2008 as compared to 2007 higher customer demand in the segment’s engine retarder business which rebounded from the impact of regulatory changes that resulted in reduced 2007 sales levels were largely offset by lower demand in the segment’s other niche businesses during year with particularly lower demand in the fourth quarter 

2007 compared to 2006 

sales from existing businesses for 2007 reflect the impact of certain regulatory requirements that became effective at the beginning of 2007 which accelerated demand for the company’s engine retarder products in 2006 and adversely impacted demand in 2007 price increases partially offset the decline in sales and contributed approximately 25 of sales growth compared to 2006 the impact of that price increase is reflected in sales from existing businesses 

operating profit margins for the segment were 131 in 2007 compared to 144 in 2006 costs associated with workforce reductions and adjustments to production levels to match demand in the engine retarder business decreased operating profit margins by 85 basis in 2007 compared with 2006 lower sales volumes in the mechanics’ hand tool business with searskmart and increased lead costs in the wheel weight business also had a negative impact on the 2007 operating margins in addition operating profit margins were adversely impacted by 40 basis points as a result of expenses incurred in connection with a fire in one of the business’ manufacturing facilities in china and costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2007 to close one facility and reduce headcount 

overview of businesses within the tools  components segment 

mechanics’ hand tools sales representing approximately 70 of segment sales in 2007 grew 10 in 2007 compared to 2006 the segment’s matco business grew slightly during 2007 as the business benefited from recent product introductions and price increases which offset declines in distributor average purchase levels during 2007 the retail hand tool business experienced strength in china and in its export business to europe as well as certain of its retail channels this performance in large part was offset by a decline in sales to searskmart the retail hand tools business’ largest customer yearoveryear softness in samestore sales of hand tools at searskmart also adversely impacted the business 

the segment’s niche businesses experienced midsingle digit sales declines during 2007 as compared to 2006 the impact of the regulatory issue noted above was partially offset by improved sales performance in the segment’s wheel service business during 2007 driven by price increases necessary to recover increased lead costs 

  

gross profit 

 

 gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2008 increased 110 basis points from 2007 included in the 2008 gross profit margins is 33 million 25 basis points of restructuring and other related costs the increase in gross profit margins over 2007 is primarily a result of leverage on increased sales volume particularly in highermargin consumable oriented businesses the impact of costsaving initiatives that began in late 2007 and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired primarily tektronix the impact on gross margins of higher commodity costs prevalent through the majority of 2008 was partially mitigated by price increases implemented throughout the company these higher commodity costs have declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and assuming the costs remain at the current levels will provide a benefit to the company in 2009 assuming sales volumes similar to those experienced by the company during 2008 

the increase in gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from leverage on increased sales volume the ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by our danaher business system processes and lowcost region initiatives and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired and increases in selling prices gross profit margins also improved due to lowermargin sales to usps in the product identification business comprising a smaller proportion of sales during 2007 compared to 2006 the gross margins for 2007 also benefited from the inclusion of a full year of results from highermargin sybron business as compared to 2006 which only included seven months of sybron results as a result of sybron acquisition in may 2006 the improvements were partially offset by higher commodity costs incurred in 2007 for which full recovery in the form of price increases dilutes reported margins 

operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2008 increased 170 basis points from 2007 included in the 2008 selling general and administrative expenses is 49 million 40 basis points of restructuring and other related costs other increases in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are primarily associated with recently acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures increased spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the company particularly in emerging markets also contributed to the growth as a percentage of sales 

  

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points during 2007 as compared to 2006 levels the yearoveryear increases resulted from recently acquired businesses principally sybron dental and vision which generally have higher operating expense structures compared to the company’s other businesses as well as increased investment in sales forces in emerging markets these increases were partially offset by operating leverage from higher sales during 2007 as compared to 2006 in addition the recovery of certain previously writtenoff indemnity receivable balances during 2007 favorably impacted selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 

research and development expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 20 basis points higher in 2008 as compared to 2007 the 2007 charge for acquired inprocess research and development related to the tektronix acquisition as described below impacted yearoveryear comparisons by 75 basis points the relatively higher research and development cost structures of recently acquired businesses primarily tektronix and higher investment in research and development in the medical technologies segment were the primary drivers of these yearoveryear increases the company continues to invest in new product development within all of its businesses with particular emphasis on the medical technologies test and measurement environmental and product identification businesses 

research and development expenses were approximately 90 basis points higher in 2007 as compared to 2006 in 2007 the company expensed approximately 604 million of inprocess research and development related to the tektronix acquisition as compared to approximately 65 million of inprocess research and development expensed in 2006 related to the vision acquisition newly acquired companies and their higher relative research and development cost structures also contributed to the yearoveryear increase 

interest costs and financing transactions 

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness please refer to “–liquidity and capital resources – financing activities and indebtedness” below 

interest expense of 130 million in 2008 was approximately 20 million higher than 2007 as a result of higher average debt levels during 2008 primarily as a result of borrowings incurred in the fourth quarter 2007 to fund the acquisition of tektronix interest expense of 110 million in 2007 was approximately 30 million higher than 2006 the increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels during 2007 due to borrowings incurred to fund the 2007 acquisitions of tektronix and chemtreat and the 2006 acquisitions of sybron and vision 

interest income of 10 million 6 million and 8 million was recognized in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively interest income during 2008 was higher than during 2007 as a result of higher average invested cash balances as less cash was employed in acquisitions during 2008 interest income in 2007 was lower than 2006 as average invested cash balances were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 due to employing cash balances to complete several acquisitions in late 2006 and throughout 2007 as well as to repurchase shares of company common stock in 2007 in addition lower interest rates prevailing during 2007 contributed to the decrease in interest income 

income taxes 

general 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws the tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations is reflected in the period in which they occur the company’s effective tax rate for 2008 differs from the united states federal statutory rate of 35 primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the united states no provisions for united states income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states the amount of united states income taxes that may be applicable to such 

  

earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings as of december 31 2008 the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately 63 billion 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit reserves are adjusted as necessary however future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company’s estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved additionally the amount of earnings andor deductions realized in various jurisdictions in which the company operates may differ from current estimates 

yearoveryear changes in tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 was 247 258 and 224 respectively 

the company’s 2008 effective tax rate of 247 includes the impact of approximately 95 million or 003 per diluted share related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with uncertain tax positions and discrete items recorded primarily during the second quarter in addition the effective tax rate reflects a full year benefit of approximately 10 million from research and experimentation credits which were reinstated with the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2008 the effective tax rate also reflects the impact of the continued growth in earnings outside of the united states refer to note 13 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the company’s 2007 effective tax rate from continuing operations of 258 reflects net discrete tax benefits of approximately 21 million or 007 per diluted share new tax legislation that was signed into law in several taxing jurisdictions during 2007 most notably in germany and denmark reduced income tax rates for 2008 and future periods which resulted in a reduction in the company’s deferred tax liabilities and a like reduction in 2007 income tax expense as required under sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes the lower statutory rates are expected to be offset by other statutory changes in these jurisdictions such that the company’s effective tax rate in future years will not be materially reduced as a result of the legislation partially offsetting the benefit from the above tax rate reduction was the effect of establishing income tax reserves during the year related to uncertain tax positions in various taxing jurisdiction net of the reduction of tax reserves associated with sweden 

the effective tax rate for 2009 is expected to be approximately 26 

inflation 

market forces during the first nine months of 2008 resulted in generally higher average costs for raw materials with prices of many raw materials reaching historic price levels early in the third quarter these costs generally declined after reaching these historic levels the company passed along certain of these cost increases to its customers the raw materials purchased at record high price levels have largely been consumed in the production process 

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 

  

interest rate risk 

the company’s shortterm debt obligations relate primarily to commercial paper borrowings refer to note 8 for information regarding the company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31 2008 as these obligations mature the company anticipates issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect the company’s results of operations in 2008 a 100 percent increase in average market interest rates on the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the company’s interest expense by approximately 29 million a 100 percent hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2008 

based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basispoint increase in interest rates at december 31 2008 the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons would decrease by approximately 65 million the lyons have not been included in this calculation as the value of the convertible debt is primarily derived from the lyons conversion feature the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore with respect to the fixedrate longterm debt fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity 

in connection with the maturity and repayment of the company’s 250 million aggregate principal amount of 61 notes in october 2008 the company’s two associated interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of 100 million matured the swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and qualified as “effective” or “perfect” hedges 

currency exchange rate risk 

exchange rate risk arises from the company’s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries as well as from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries net of the translation effect of the eurobonds is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive income” component of stockholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at december 31 2008 net of the translation effect of the company’s eurobond notes discussed below would result in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 396 million 

in addition although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements the eurobond notes described below which as of december 31 2008 had outstanding borrowings in principal amount equivalent to 699 million and the eurodenominated portion of the company’s commercial paper program which as of december 31 2008 had no outstanding borrowings provide a natural hedge to a portion of the company’s european net asset position 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 two wholly owned subsidiaries of the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts related to anticipated sales denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiaries entering the contracts the forward contracts having an aggregate notional amount of 34 billion japanese yen 375 million related to one subsidiary and an aggregate notional amount of 145 million euro 203 million related to the second subsidiary will be settled at various dates during the year ending december 31 2009 in 

  

accordance with their terms in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended the company accounts for these forward contracts as cash flow hedges these instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges as of december 31 2008 the aggregate fair value of the forward contracts was approximately 2 million 

credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments foreign currency forward contracts and trade accounts receivable the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments the company places cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate notwithstanding these efforts the current distress in the global economy may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities 

although recent distress in the financial markets and the global economy in general has not had a significant impact on the company’s liquidity as of the filing date of this report management continues to monitor the financial markets and general global economic conditions the capital markets worldwide including the united states have been severely impacted by credit losses asset writedowns and failures of some financial institutions this disruption has impacted credit spreads and pricing on new securities issuances the company’s credit facility is predominately with institutions that to date appear to be relatively unaffected by the disruption the company’s ability to access the commercial paper market has also not to date been affected adversely by the capital markets’ disruption the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its cash flow and other sources of liquidity primarily its commercial paper program and committed credit facility will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions and maintain its capital structure on a short and longterm basis for a discussion of risks related to the distress in the financial markets and the global economy in general please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

 

  

  

   

  

 operating activities 

the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes pension funding decisions and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flow from continuing operations a key source of the company’s liquidity was approximately 19 billion for 2008 an increase of 160 million or approximately 95 as compared to 2007 earnings growth of 104 million in addition to an increase of approximately 39 million in contributions from operating working capital which the company defines as trade accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable as compared to 2007 contributed to the overall yearoveryear increase in operating cash flows the 2008 operating working capital contribution increased primarily due to strong collections of accounts receivable operating cash flows during 2008 also benefited approximately 83 million from yearoveryear increases in stock compensation depreciation and amortization charges which do not require the use of cash in addition noncash acquisition related charges incurred related to acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue in connection with the 2007 acquisition of tektronix had a positive impact on operating cash flow comparisons approximately 100 million of additional income tax payments made in 2008 related to continuing operations as compared to 2007 partially offset these positive factors 

investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was 567 million during 2008 compared to 34 billion of net cash used in the comparable period of 2007 gross capital spending increased 32 million from 162 million during 2007 to 194 million during 2008 due primarily to capital spending relating to newly acquired businesses and increased spending related to investments in the company’s lowcost region sourcing initiatives new products and other growth opportunities capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity replacing equipment supporting new product development and improving information technology systems in 2009 the company expects capital spending to exceed 200 million though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions 

net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was 34 billion in 2007 compared to approximately 28 billion in 2006 gross capital spending increased 26 million in 2007 from 2006 levels to 162 million 

as discussed below the company completed numerous business acquisitions and divestitures during 2008 2007 and 2006 all of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the company’s financial statements this goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses are expected to bring to existing operations for a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

2008 acquisitions 

the company acquired seventeen companies or product lines during 2008 for consideration of approximately 423 million in cash including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and 85 million of debt assumed each company acquired manufactures instrumentation andor supply products in the life sciences dental product identification environmental or test and measurement markets these companies were acquired to complement 

  

existing units of the medical technologies industrial technologies or professional instrumentation segments the aggregate annual sales of these seventeen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately 325 million 

2007 acquisitions and divestiture 

in november 2007 the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of tektronix inc for total cash consideration of approximately 28 billion including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired the company initially financed the acquisition of tektronix through the issuance of commercial paper and available cash including proceeds from the underwritten public offering of 69 million shares of danaher common stock completed on november 2 2007 subsequent to the acquisition the company issued 500 million of 5625 senior notes due 2018 in an underwritten public offering and used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the tektronix acquisition

financing activities and indebtedness 

cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper common stock and notes repayments of indebtedness repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders financing activities used cash of 11 billion during 2008 compared to 17 billion of cash provided during 2007 the yearoveryear change was primarily due to repayment of a substantial portion of the commercial paper indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisitions of tektronix and chemtreat in 2007 the repurchase of shares of danaher common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program repayment of the 250 million aggregate principal amount of 61 notes due 2008 net of commercial paper issued to refinance such repayment and dividends paid during 2008 

total debt was 2619 million at december 31 2008 compared to 3726 million at december 31 2007 the company’s debt as of december 31 2008 was as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 the company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt except in connection with the change of control triggers described as follows under each of the eurobond notes and the 2018 notes if the company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control the company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of 2018 notes or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of eurobond notes the company’s outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and saleleaseback transactions none of these covenants are considered restrictive to the company’s operations and as of december 31 2008 the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants for a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

  

commercial paper program and credit facility 

the company satisfies its shortterm liquidity needs primarily through issuances of us dollar and euro commercial paper under the company’s us dollar and euro commercial paper programs the company or a subsidiary of the company as applicable may issue and sell unsecured shortterm promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40 billion since the credit facility described below provides credit support for the program the 145 billion of availability under the credit facility has the practical effect of reducing from 40 billion to 145 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the company can issue under the program commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes including financing acquisitions the company classifies the borrowings under the commercial paper program as longterm borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the company has the intent and the ability as supported by the availability of the credit facility to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date 

credit support for part of the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured 145 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires on april 25 2012 the credit facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes interest is based on at the company’s option 1 a liborbased formula that is dependent in part on the company’s credit rating or 2 a formula based on bank of america’s prime rate or on the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or 3 the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility the credit facility requires the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of 065 to 100 or less the availability of the credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of our commercial paper program we expect to limit any borrowings under the credit facility to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

during 2008 the company utilized its commercial paper program to finance the repayment of the 61 notes due 2008 during 2007 the company utilized its commercial paper program as well as operating cash flow and the proceeds from the november 2007 common stock offering and december 2007 offering of the 2018 notes to fund the acquisitions of chemtreat and tektronix as of december 31 2008 624 million was outstanding under the company’s us dollar commercial paper program with a weighted average interest rate of 10 and an average maturity of approximately 13 days as of december 31 2008 there was no outstanding eurodenominated commercial paper 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions any downgrade in the company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program and credit facility and could limit or preclude the company’s ability to issue commercial paper we have not experienced difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available operating cash flow and our credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

in connection with the financing of the tektronix acquisition in november 2007 the company entered into a 19 billion unsecured revolving bridge loan facility the “bridge facility” which provided additional credit support for the commercial paper program and was also available for working capital and other corporate purposes in december 2007 danaher reduced the amount of the bridge facility to 10 billion to minimize maintenance costs and in may 2008 danaher further reduced the facility to 05 billion the bridge facility expired on november 11 2008 there were no borrowings under either the credit facility or the bridge facility during 2008

on july 21 2006 a financing subsidiary of the company issued the eurobond notes in a private placement outside the us payment obligations under these eurobond notes are guaranteed by the company the net proceeds of the offering after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs were €496 million 627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed and were used to pay down a portion of the company’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes including acquisitions the company may redeem the notes upon the occurrence of specified adverse changes in tax laws or interpretations under such laws at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed 

in 2001 the company issued 830 million value at maturity in lyons the net proceeds to the company were 505 million of which approximately 100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions the lyons carry a yield to maturity of 2375 with contingent interest payable as described below holders of the lyons may convert each 1000 of principal amount at maturity into 145352 shares of danaher common stock in the aggregate for all lyons approximately 120 million shares of danaher common stock at any time on or before the maturity date of january 22 2021 as of december 31 2008 an aggregate of approximately 68000 shares of danaher common stock had been issued upon conversion of lyons as of december 31 2008 the accreted value of the outstanding lyons was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion the company may redeem all or a portion of the lyons for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash andor company common stock at the company’s option on january 22 2011 the holders had a similar option to require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of january 22 2004 which resulted in notes with an accreted value of 11 million being redeemed by the company for cash 

under the terms of the lyons the company will pay contingent interest to the holders of lyons during any six month period from january 23 to july 22 and from july 23 to january 22 if the average market price of a lyon for a specified measurement period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such lyon the amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 00315 of the bonds’ average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a lyon the company paid approximately 14 million of contingent interest on the lyons for the year ended december 31 2008 except for the contingent interest described above the company will not pay interest on the lyons prior to maturity 

the 250 million of 61 notes due 2008 matured october 15 2008 and were repaid from the proceeds of commercial paper borrowings

cash and cash requirements 

the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions to pay interest and service debt fund its pension plans as required pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the company’s common stock the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements and may borrow under existing commercial paper programs or the credit facility or subject to availability access the capital markets as needed for liquidity subject to market conditions and management’s judgment the company intends to seek to publicly issue debt securities prior to the end of the first quarter of 2009 the proceeds of which would be used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper andor for other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2008 the company held 393 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less of this amount approximately 373 million was held outside the united states repatriation of these amounts is either restricted or prohibited by local laws andor would potentially trigger united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits as discussed below 

the company’s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside the united states the company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed wherever possible cash management is centralized and intracompany financing is used to provide working capital to the company’s operations most of the cash balances held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would potentially be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted or prohibited by local laws where local restrictions prevent an efficient intracompany transfer of funds the company’s intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both 

the provisions of the us pension protection act of 2006 enacted in august 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for the company’s us pension plan beginning in 2009 during 2009 the company’s cash contribution requirements for its us pension plan are not expected to be significant funding requirements for the us pension may become more significant commencing in the year ended december 31 2010 however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things underlying asset returns and the impact of recent legislative activity associated with pension funding obligations cash contributions during 2009 related to the company’s nonus pension plans are expected to be approximately 30 million

in connection with five acquisitions the company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts in the future as additional purchase price the company enters into these types of arrangements to help bridge differences of opinion that the company and the sellers may have over the appropriate value of the acquired business the company could pay nothing in the aggregate pursuant to these agreements or a maximum of up to 724 million over the next 15 years depending on the performance of the respective businesses during the specified performance period 

other offbalancesheet arrangements 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters the company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions however the company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

due to the company’s downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions restructuring plans or otherwise certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

the company’s certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions danaher’s amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition danaher intends to execute with each of its directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement with danaher which will provide for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher will agree to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding certain litigation matters 

in addition to the litigation matters noted under “item 1 business – regulatory matters – environmental health  safety” the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices personal injury and insurance coverage the company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages while the company maintains workers compensation property cargo automobile aviation crime fiduciary product general liability and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions that it believes cover a portion of these claims this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses in addition while the company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses based upon the company’s experience current information and applicable law it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows financial position or results of operations 

the company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts for general liability risk which includes product liability and most other insured risks the company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the selfinsured retention these reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of outside risk insurance professionals for product liability in addition outside risk insurances professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors while the company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers for claims paid associated with these risks it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of december 31 2008 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate if the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the amount of our accruals for selfinsurance and litigation liability

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes the following critical accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies refer to note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments the company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the company’s customers and the company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers recent deterioration in overall global economic conditions and worldwide credit markets heightens the uncertainties related to customers’ ability to pay and may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments the company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control as a result such fluctuations can be difficult to predict if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 the accounting standard for goodwill which requires that the company on an annual basis calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using various valuation techniques with the initial estimate being calculated using a market based approach where fair value is estimated based on ebitda multiples determined by available precedent transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach management assesses the relevance and reliability of the precedent transaction ebitda multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units including recent operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and other market data to the extent the fair value as estimated by the market based approach exceeds the carrying value of a reporting unit by less than 30 management performs an analysis using the income approach to estimate fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis related to that reporting unit once completed the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis as described above did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the first day of the company’s fiscal fourth quarter the annual testing date ranged from approximately 14 to approximately 421 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit the results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the 

  

respective reporting unit from this hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value ranged from a short fall of approximately 9 to an excess of approximately 369 for each of the company’s reporting units the carrying value of the company’s individual reporting units ranges from approximately 13 million to approximately 25 billion 

longlived assets  the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value judgments made by the company relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in the expected use of the assets changes in economic conditions changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of longlived assets there is risk that the carrying value of the company’s longlived assets may require adjustment in future periods if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates longlived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

purchase accounting  in connection with its acquisitions the company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 953 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf no 953 the company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized the company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process the company’s experience in acquiring other companies and information obtained after the closing about the acquired company’s business assets and liabilities the accruals established by the company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the restructuring plans for the business if the accruals established by the company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to restructure the acquired entity the company would be required to incur an expense which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings to the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances as a result of the implementation of sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” that became effective january 1 2009 the provisions of eitf 953 will not be applicable to acquisitions completed subsequent to january 1 2009 acquisitions completed prior to december 31 2008 will continue to apply the provisions of eitf 953 refer to “new accounting standards” below for additional information 

environmental  the company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmentalrelated personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries the company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites if the company determines that potential remediation liability for properties currently or previously owned is probable and reasonably estimable it accrues the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site we also estimate our exposure for probable environmentalrelated personal injury claims and accrue for this estimated liability while the company actively pursues insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realization is deemed probable 

the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the company’s involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations as such there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates of environmental liabilities will not change refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information if the environmental reserves established by the company are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

  

contingent liabilities  as discussed above the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable the company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and if appropriate recognizes a liability for these contingencies with the assistance of legal counsel and if applicable other professionals these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the company’s settlement strategy for a discussion of these contingencies including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

as discussed above under “—legal proceedings” the company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts for these liabilities and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the selfinsured retention please see “—legal proceedings” for a discussion of how reserves are established for selfinsurance and litigation liability the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of december 31 2008 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate if the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

revenue recognition  the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of professional industrial medical and consumer products and services for revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition there must be persuasive evidence of a sale delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured the company’s standard terms of sale are fob shipping point and as such the company principally records revenue for product sale upon shipment if any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled product returns consist of estimated returns for products sold and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale as required by sfas no 48 revenue recognition when right of return exists customer allowances and rebates consisting primarily of volume discounts and other shortterm incentive programs are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the purchase price for the products purchased in accordance with eitf 019 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor’s products product returns customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends revenue related to maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement as required by fasb technical bulletin 901 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 

revenues for contractual arrangements with multiple elements are allocated pursuant to emerging issues task force issue 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in the case of arrangements that include more than incidental software the provisions of aicpa statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition as amended by sop 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions are applied revenues are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exist or in the case of software related products vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the company’s control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are identifiable as those elements are also sold unaccompanied by other elements 

sharebased compensation  the company accounts for sharebased compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment which requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted including stock options 

  

rsus and restricted shares based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r the company recognizes equitybased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected life of the sharebased payment awards and stock price volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the equitybased compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

pension and other postretirement benefits  certain of the company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans pension plans and certain eligible retirees are provided health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans postretirement plans the company accounts for its pension and postretirement plans in accordance with sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions sfas no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and sfas no 158  employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas no 87 and sfas no 106 require that the amounts the company records including the expense or income associated with the pension and postretirement plans is computed using actuarial valuations 

calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations these include assumptions the company makes relating to financial market and other economic conditions changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used by the company the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include discount rates expected return on plan assets rate of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors while the company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the company’s financial position or results of operations for the united states plan the company used a 625 discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at december 31 2008 which represents an increase of 25 basis points in the discount rate from december 31 2007 for nonus plans rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the us and nonus net obligation by 58 million 38 million on an after tax basis from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2008 

for 2008 the expected longterm rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the united states plan was estimated at 8 which is the same as the rate used in 2007 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan targets to invest between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds pension benefit for the us plan for the year ended december 31 2008 was 5 million or 3 million on an aftertax basis compared with pension expense of 13 million or 8 million on an aftertax basis for this plan in 2007 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 05 pension expense for 2008 would have increased 6 million or 4 million on an aftertax basis the company made no contributions to the us plan in 2008 the company’s nonus plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 15 to 825 for 2008 and ranged from 075 to 75 for 2007 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” this statement requires a 

  

company to a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s over funded status or a liability for a plan’s under funded status b measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur reported in comprehensive income the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements were effective and adopted by the company as of the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 the adoption of the recognition provisions of the standard reduced the amount of pension and other postretirement liabilities as of december 31 2006 by approximately 23 million and increased stockholders equity by approximately 156 million due to the recognition of previously unrecognized overfunded positions in certain of the company’s nonus pension plans and due to the recognition of actuarially determined prior service credits associated with the company’s us based retiree benefit program 

the requirement to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year–end statement of financial position was effective and adopted by the company as of the year ended december 31 2008 prior to adoption of the measurement date provisions the majority of the company’s pension and postretirement plans used a september 30 measurement date the adoption of the measurement date provisions of sfas no 158 increased longterm liabilities by approximately 6 million and decreased stockholders’ equity by approximately 4 million there was no effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows 

the provisions of the us pension protection act of 2006 enacted in august 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for the company’s us pension plan beginning in 2009 during 2009 the company’s cash contribution requirements for its us pension plan are not expected to be significant funding requirements for the us pension may become more significant commencing in the year ending december 31 2010 however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things underlying asset returns and the impact of recent legislative activity associated with pension funding obligations cash contributions during 2009 related to the company’s nonus pension plans are expected to be approximately 30 million 

new accounting standards 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” sfas no 141r and sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” “sfas no 160” sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas no 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 160 clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in the financial statements and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests sfas no 141r and sfas no 160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and impacts the accounting for acquisitions completed after january 1 2009 the adoption of sfas no 141r will likely have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations however the magnitude of that impact is dependent on the frequency and relative size of the acquisitions completed by the company in general more frequent acquisition activity and relatively larger acquisitions will have a more significant impact the adoption of sfas no 160 on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations is not expected to be significant 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 sfas no 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities it also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas no 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances sfas no 157 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the adoption of sfas no 157 did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas no 159 sfas no 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair 

  

value under sfas no 159 a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities equity method investments accounts payable guarantees and issued debt other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and noncash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services if the use of fair value is elected any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred such as debt issuance costs the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value at the adoption date unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 159 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings sfas no 159 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the adoption of sfas no 159 did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions the company adopted fin 48 as of january 1 2007 as required as a result of the implementation the company recognized a decrease of 63 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as an increase to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time however we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher or its subsidiaries 

competition 

although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the diversity of the products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies that have greater sales marketing research and financial resources than we do the number of competitors varies by product line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets served key competitive factors typically include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business as well as price quality delivery speed service and support innovation distribution network and brand name for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and endmarkets that they serve for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products and sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items 

backlog 

the table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our four segments as of the end of each year  in millions 

 

 we expect that a large majority of unfilled orders will be delivered to customers within 3 to 4 months given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm performance 

  

employee relations 

at december 31 2007 we employed approximately 50000 persons of which approximately 24000 were employed in the united states of these united states employees approximately 2500 were hourlyrated unionized employees we also have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements or union contracts in other countries though we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory we are subject to potential union campaigns work stoppages union negotiations and other potential labor disputes 

research and development 

the table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate  in millions 

 

  

 we conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products enhancing the functionality effectiveness ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of our products are appropriate we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position for a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2007 was from customers other than governmental entities we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense product identification water quality and motion businesses as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements reductions in federal spending and other factors we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts including requirements related to procurement integrity export control employment practices the accuracy of records and the recording of costs our failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts criminal or civil sanctions administrative penalties or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time for a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

  

regulatory matters 

environmental health  safety 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with our operations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition to environmental compliance costs we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and nonus environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous wastes require cleanup and other possible remedial action including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have made a provision for environmental remediation and environmentalrelated personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries we generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with similar sites if the company determines that potential remediation liability for properties currently or previously owned is probable and reasonably estimable it accrues the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site we also estimate our exposure for environmentalrelated personal injury claims and accrue for this estimated liability as such claims become known while we actively pursue insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realization is deemed probable and reasonably estimable the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations as such we cannot assure you that our estimates of environmental liabilities will not change 

in view of our financial position and reserves for environmental remediation matters and environmentalrelated personal injury claims and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect we believe that our liability related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow for a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical devices 

certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration the “fda” and by the counterpart agencies of the nonus countries where our products are sold some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the united states 

  

pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fda regulates virtually all phases of the manufacture sale and distribution of medical devices including their introduction into interstate commerce manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping pursuant to the fdca and fda regulations certain facilities of our operating subsidiaries are registered with the fda as medical device manufacturing establishments the fda as well as our iso notified bodies regularly inspect our registered andor certified facilities 

we sell both class i and class ii medical devices a medical device whether exempt from or cleared pursuant to the premarket notification requirements of the fdca or cleared pursuant to a premarket approval application is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the fda to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements including but not limited to product labeling requirements and limitations including those related to promotion and marketing efforts current good manufacturing practices and quality system requirements record keeping and medical device adverse event reporting for a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the fda and counterpart agencies of other countries please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition certain of our products utilize radioactive material we are subject to federal state and local regulations governing the management storage handling and disposal of these materials 

exportimport compliance 

we are required to comply with various exportimport control and economic sanctions laws including 

 

  

  

  

 nonunited states governments have also implemented similar export and import control regulations which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams to offset economic trends in individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries the table below describes annual revenue derived outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate 

  

 our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia 

the table below describes longlived assets located outside the united states as a percentage of total longlived assets in each of the last three years by segment and in the aggregate 

 

 for additional information related to revenues and longlived assets by country please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

the manner in which our products and services are sold differs by business and by region most of our sales in nonus markets are made by subsidiaries located outside the united states though we also sell into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors and directly from the us in countries with low sales volumes we generally sell through representatives and distributors 

financial information about our international operations is contained in note 16 of the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and information about the possible effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of risks related to our nonus operations and foreign currency exchange please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

major customers

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as overall us and nonus economic and industry conditions a global economic slowdown geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism international conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors we are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets and as a result of increasing consolidation in particular markets in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers establish relationships with new customers continually develop new products and services designed to maintain our leadership position in various product categories and penetrate new markets our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues profitability and cash flow and pricing pressures may adversely impact our profitability 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis our products will become technologically obsolete over time and our revenues cash flow profitability and competitive position will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

our growth rate could decline if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline in our customers markets would likely result in diminished demand for our products and services and would adversely affect our growth rate and profitability 

our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital conversely any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course some of which may be material during 2007 we acquired twelve businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 36 billion including transaction costs and net of cash acquired during 2006 we acquired eleven businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 27 billion including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and during 2005 we acquired 13 businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 885 million including transaction costs and net of cash acquired our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial managerial and operational challenges including the following any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 conversely we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate our ability to grow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings in addition changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or any further deterioration in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions or change the accounting treatment for acquisitions for example as a result of the recently issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 141 r business combinations which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we will be required to expense certain acquisitionrelated items that under current accounting rules do not impact our income statement 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

  

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of each of their companies before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

the resolution of contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold such as lawsuits product liability claims and environmental matters and agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and avoid claims of infringement or misuse of third party intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our operations the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations in addition from time to time in the usual course of business we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation in the event of a successful claim against us we could lose our rights to needed technology or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights any of which could adversely impact our revenues profitability and cash flows even where we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters commercial disputes environmental matters and acquisitionrelated matters some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition operations and results of operations moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the us and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or 

  

current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

in addition to the environmental regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental entities and other entities at the federal state and local levels including the following 

 

  

  

 in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials competition money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation 

  

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and changes in tax laws any of these factors may adversely affect our tax rate and decrease our profitability the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 

foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we have substantial assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate these items into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates in addition we are a large buyer of steel nonferrous metals and petroleumbased products as well as other commodities required for the manufacture of products as a result changes in currency exchange rates and commodity prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our business and financial results will suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations some of our businesses purchase their requirements of certain of these items from sole or limited source suppliers if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed our production requirements or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations and the failure of governmental and other entities to adopt new regulations could adversely affect our growth rate in addition certain of our customers receive reimbursement from government insurance programs for some of the costs of the products that they purchase from us reductions in these reimbursement rates adversely impact the demand for our products 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition or performance of key distributors resellers and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors resellers and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse 

  

developments in their financial condition or performance could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in addition the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare could adversely impact our profitability 

the inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to 

 

  

  

 international economic political legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in 2007 approximately 51 of our sales were derived outside the us since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us we expect to continue to increase our sales outside the us particularly in emerging markets in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the us our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and overall growth 

cyclical economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our businesses operate in industries that have historically experienced periodic downturns which have adversely impacted demand for the equipment and services that we manufacture and market any competitive pricing pressures slowdown in capital investments or other downturn in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs 

we have a number of domestic collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements while we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs 

  

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates and the majority of plan assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities which are affected by market risks significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact our future operating results 

if we suffer loss to our facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility 

our indebtedness may limit our use of our cash flow 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 37 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to incur an additional 09 billion of indebtedness in the form of commercial paper or bank loans under our outstanding facilities and programs we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

  

  

 we may incur significantly more debt in the future if we add new debt the risks described above could increase in addition any further deterioration in the credit markets may impact the availability and cost of future debt borrowings

 the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited consolidated financial statements 

overview 

danaher strives to create shareholder value through 

 

  

  

 to accomplish these goals the company uses a set of tools and processes known as the danaher business system “dbs” which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality delivery cost and innovation within the dbs framework the company also pursues a number of ongoing strategic initiatives intended to improve operational performance including global sourcing of materials and services and innovative product development the company also acquires businesses that it believes can help it achieve the objectives described above and believes that many acquisition opportunities remain available within its target markets the company will acquire businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business the extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and effectively integrated can affect the company’s overall growth and operating results the company also continually assesses the strategic fit of its existing businesses and may divest businesses that are not deemed to strategically fit with ongoing operations or are not achieving the desired return on investment 

danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations in 2007 approximately 51 of danaher’s sales were derived outside the united states as a global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industry economic and political factors however danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of its product sales and services has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future in addition the company’s order rates are highly indicative of the company’s revenue in the short term and thus a key measure of anticipated performance in those industry segments where the company is a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the company’s customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 

significant acquisitions and divestitures 

in november 2007 the company significantly expanded its test and measurement business with the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of tektronix inc tektronix for total cash consideration of approximately 28 billion including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired tektronix is a leading supplier of test measurement and monitoring products solutions and services for engineers in the communications computer consumer electronics and education industries as well as in militaryaerospace semiconductor and a broad range of other industries 

  

worldwide tektronix had annual revenues of approximately 11 billion in its most recently completed fiscal year and is part of danaher’s test and measurement business included in the professional instrumentation segment the company funded the purchase price of the tektronix acquisition with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and the company’s november 2007 common stock offering described below and to a lesser extent from available cash 

tektronix is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company’s test and measurement business both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses the combination of tektronix with danaher’s existing test and measurement businesses is also expected to yield significant cost reductions company management and other personnel are devoting significant attention to the successful integration of the tektronix business into danaher 

on november 7 2007 the company completed the underwritten public offering of 69 million shares of danaher common stock at a price to the public of 8225 per share the net proceeds after expenses and the underwriters’ discount were approximately 550 million which were used to partially fund the acquisition of tektronix in addition on december 11 2007 the company completed the underwritten public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5625 senior notes due 2018 the “2018 notes” the net proceeds after expenses and the underwriters’ discount were approximately 493 million which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of tektronix

also during july 2007 the company completed the sale of its power quality business for a cash sales price of 275 million net of transaction costs and recorded an aftertax gain of 150 million 045 per diluted share prior to the sale this business was part of the industrial technologies segment the company has reported the power quality business as a discontinued operation in this form 10k in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets accordingly the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the power quality business as a discontinued operation 

business performance 

while differences exist among the company’s businesses the company generally continued to see market growth during the year ended december 31 2007 the company’s yearoveryear growth rates reflect continued strength in global economic conditions particularly europe and asia and to a lesser extent north america in addition the growth reflects the continued shift of the company’s operations into higher growth sectors of the economy growth rates slowed somewhat from the rate experienced in 2006 partially due to difficult comparisons with sales levels in 2006 within the company’s product identification businesses and the impact of regulatory changes in the company’s engine retarder business discussed below 

the company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in the markets and geographies served the company’s performance will be impacted by its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies it serves including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force consolidation of competitors the expansion of market opportunities in asia increasing significance of technology and intellectual property in the businesses in which the company operates and increases in raw material costs the company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner 

  

although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements on an overall basis the us dollar weakened against other major currencies in 2007 and closed the year at exchange rate levels weaker than the exchange rate levels as of the end of 2006 the impact of currency rate changes increased reported sales by approximately 35 during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 any further weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would benefit the company’s future results of operations any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the company’s future sales and results of operations 

results of operations 

consolidated sales from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2007 increased approximately 165 over the comparable period of 2006 sales from existing businesses contributed 45 growth acquisitions contributed 85 to the sales growth during 2007 the impact of currency translation on sales provided 35 growth as the us dollar weakened against other major currencies throughout 2007 references in this report to sales from existing businesses include sales from acquired businesses starting from and after the first anniversary of the acquisition but exclude currency effect 

the growth in sales from acquisitions in the year ended december 31 2007 primarily related to acquisitions in the company’s medical technologies and professional instrumentation businesses the acquisitions of sybron dental specialties inc sybron in may 2006 and vision systems limited vision at the end of 2006 both of which are part of the medical technologies segment have contributed the majority of this yearoveryear acquisitionrelated revenue growth also contributing to the yearoveryear growth are the acquisitions of chemtreat in july 2007 and tektronix in november 2007 both of which are included in the professional instrumentation segment and the acquisitions of other smaller businesses in the medical technologies professional instrumentation and industrial technologies segments 

operating profit margins from continuing operations for the company were 158 in the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 159 for the year ended december 31 2006 following are the key factors impacting the yearoveryear comparison of operating profit margins 

 

  

   

the effective tax rate for 2007 of 258 reflects net discrete tax benefits of approximately 21 million or 007 per diluted share new tax legislation that was signed into law in several taxing jurisdictions during 2007 most notably in germany and denmark reduced income tax rates for 2008 and future periods which resulted in a reduction in the company’s deferred tax liabilities and a like reduction in 2007 income tax expense as required under sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes the lower statutory rates are expected to be offset by other statutory changes in these jurisdictions such that the companys effective tax rate in future years will not be materially reduced as a result of the legislation partially offsetting the benefit from the above tax rate reduction was the effect of establishing income tax reserves during the year related to uncertain tax positions in various taxing jurisdiction net of the reduction of tax reserves associated with sweden refer to note 13 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information the company expects the tax rate for 2008 to be approximately 27

during 2007 the motion business experienced sales growth primarily in the elevator markets as a result of global conversions to more energy efficient systems and new construction demand in asia demand in oem applications in europe also contributed yearoveryear sales growth these growth drivers however were more than offset by yearoveryear sales declines resulting from weakness in certain technology end markets as well as declines in the miniature motors business reflecting reduced customer demand 

product identification the product identification businesses accounted for approximately 28 of segment sales in 2007 sales from the company’s product identification businesses increased 35 in 2007 compared to 2006 sales 

  

from existing businesses accounted for a 10 decline while currency translation contributed 35 to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 10 to revenue growth in 2007

focused niche businesses the segment’s niche businesses in the aggregate experienced 10 sales growth in 2007 compared to 2006 this growth was primarily driven by strong sales growth from existing businesses in the company’s aerospace and defense businesses partially offset by sales declines in the company’s sensors and controls business reflecting continued softness in the semiconductor and electronic assembly markets 

2006 compared to 2005 

sales growth from existing businesses was due primarily to sales growth in the motion aerospace and defense and sensor and controls businesses price increases which are included in sales from existing businesses contributed approximately 15 to overall sales growth compared to 2005 several small acquisitions in 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 accounted for 1 growth 

operating profit margins for the segment were 157 in 2006 compared to 146 in 2005 the overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by additional leverage from sales growth ongoing cost reductions associated with danaher business system initiatives completed during 2005 and 2006 and margin improvements in businesses acquired in prior years which typically have higher cost structures than the company’s existing operations recently acquired businesses had no dilutive impact on overall operating profit margins for 2006 the improvements to operating profit margins were partially offset by the implementation of sfas no 123r which required the company to record approximately 145 million of stock option compensation costs and reduced operating profit margins by 45 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005 operating profit margin comparisons for 2006 compared to 2005 are also negatively impacted by 35 basis points related to gains on sale of a business and the collection of a previously reserved note receivable during 2005 and were positively impacted by 65 basis points related to a fourth quarter 2005 loss from the settlement of patent infringement litigation not repeating in 2006 

overview of businesses within industrial technologies segment 

motion sales in the company’s motion businesses representing approximately 33 of segment sales in 2006 increased by 6 over 2005 sales from existing businesses accounted for 5 growth acquisitions accounted for 05 growth and currency translation contributed growth of 05 

sales from existing businesses increased from 2005 levels due primarily to broad based growth across the standard and custom motor drive and controls lines this growth was somewhat offset by softness in certain technology end markets the business also experienced continued growth in sales of its linear products during 2006

 components of sales growth 

 

 2007 compared to 2006 

sales from existing businesses for 2007 reflect the impact of certain regulatory requirements that became effective at the beginning of 2007 which accelerated demand for the company’s engine retarder products in 2006 and have adversely impacted demand in 2007 price increases partially offset the decline in sales and contributed approximately 25 of sales growth compared to 2006 the impact of that increase is reflected in sales from existing businesses 

operating profit margins for the segment were 131 in 2007 compared to 144 in 2006 costs associated with workforce reductions and adjustments to production levels to match demand in the engine retarder business decreased operating profit margins by 85 basis in 2007 compared with 2006 lower sales volumes in the mechanics’ hand tool business with searskmart and increased lead costs in the wheel weight business also had a negative impact on the 2007 operating margins in addition operating profit margins were adversely impacted by 40 basis points as a result of expenses incurred in connection with a fire in one of the business’ manufacturing facilities in china and restructuring costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2007 to close one facility and reduce headcount 

overview of businesses within the tools  components segment 

mechanics’ hand tools sales representing approximately 70 of segment sales in 2007 grew 10 in 2007 compared to 2006 the segment’s matco business grew slightly during 2007 as the business benefited from recent product introductions and price increases which offset declines in distributor average purchase levels during 2007 the retail hand tool business experienced strength in china and in its export business to europe as well as certain of its retail channels this performance in large part was offset by a decline in sales to searskmart the retail hand tools business’ largest customer yearoveryear softness in samestore sales of hand tools at searskmart continues to impact adversely the business 

  

the segment’s niche businesses experienced midsingle digit sales declines during 2007 as compared to 2006 the impact of the regulatory issue noted above was partially offset by improved sales performance in the segment’s wheel service business during 2007 driven by price increases necessary to recover increased lead costs 

2006 compared to 2005 

sales from existing businesses contributed substantially all of the growth for the segment in 2006 including approximately 15 growth due to price increases that the company implemented largely as a result of cost increases in steel and other commodities 

operating profit margins for the segment were 144 in 2006 compared to 154 in 2005 implementation of sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 reduced segment operating profit by approximately 6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 negatively impacting yearoveryear operating margins by 45 basis points the company also incurred costs associated with exiting a small product line during the second half of 2006 which reduced 2006 operating profit margins by approximately 30 basis points operating profit margins also declined during 2006 due to lower margin products accounting for a larger proportion of sales within the segment as well as due to higher overall freight costs finally yearoveryear operating margin comparisons were negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points as a result of a 53 million 39 million after taxes gain on the sale of real estate in 2005 the adverse impacts on operating margins described above were offset somewhat by the impact of leverage from higher sales levels including the pricing actions implemented in 2006 as well as the benefit of restructuring actions taken in 2005 

overview of businesses within the tools  components segment 

mechanics’ hand tools sales representing approximately 70 of segment sales grew 5 in 2006 compared to 2005 the sales growth was driven primarily by the group’s matco business which achieved highsingle digit growth during 2006 driven by increases in both the number of distributors and their average purchase levels the retail mechanics’ hand tools business also grew in the second half of 2006 compared to the second half of 2005 as sellthrough at sears a major customer of the segment improved from prior year levels the business continued to experience growth with its other retail customers as well as expanding markets for the business’ products in china the segment’s niche businesses experienced midsingle digit sales growth for 2006 compared to 2005 as strength in the truck box and engine retarder businesses was partially offset by weakness in the chuck business 

gross profit 

 

 the increase in gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from leverage on increased sales volume the ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by our danaher business system processes and lowcost region initiatives and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired and increases in selling prices gross profit margins also improved due to lowermargin sales to united states postal service in the product identification business comprising a smaller proportion of sales during 2007 compared to 2006 the gross margins for 2007 also benefited from the inclusion of a full year of results from highermargin sybron business as compared to 2006 which only included seven months of sybron results as a result of sybron acquisition in may 2006 the improvements were partially offset by higher commodity costs incurred in 2007 for which full recovery in the form of price increases dilutes reported margins 

  

gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2006 benefited from leverage on increased sales volume the ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by our danaher business system processes and lowcost region initiatives generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired increases in selling prices to offset some of the increases in cost and surcharges related to steel and other commodity purchases also contributed to gross profit improvement these improvements were partially offset by a change in mix to certain lower margin businesses including the gilbarco veederroot business and sales to the united states postal service in the product identification business in addition the company recorded a loss on a product development venture in the first quarter of 2006 and incurred higher initial product costs associated with the sybron acquisition in the second quarter of 2006 which further reduced gross margins for the year ended december 31 2006 

operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points during 2007 as compared to 2006 levels the yearoveryear increases resulted from recently acquired businesses principally sybron dental and vision which generally have higher operating expense structures compared to the company’s other businesses as well as increased investment in sales forces in emerging markets these increases were partially offset by operating leverage from higher sales during 2007 as compared to 2006 in addition the recovery of certain previously writtenoff indemnity receivable balances during 2007 favorably impacted selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were higher in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of the higher operating expense structures of businesses acquired during 2006 as well as the implementation of sfas no 123r at the beginning of 2006 which required the company to record approximately 550 million in stock option compensation costs 

research and development expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 90 basis points higher in 2007 as compared to 2006 in 2007 the company expensed approximately 604 million of inprocess research and development related to the tektronix acquisition as compared to approximately 65 million of inprocess research and development expensed in 2006 related to the vision acquisition newly acquired companies and their higher relative research and development cost structures also contributed to the yearoveryear increase research and development expenses as a percentage of sales during 2006 were consistent with the 2005 level the company continues to invest in new product development within all of its businesses with particular emphasis on the medical technologies test and measurement environmental and product identification businesses 

interest costs and financing transactions 

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness please refer to “–liquidity and capital resources – financing activities and indebtedness” below 

interest expense of 1097 million in 2007 was approximately 303 million higher than 2006 the increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels during 2007 due to borrowings incurred to fund the 2007 acquisitions of tektronix and chemtreat and the 2006 acquisitions of sybron and vision interest expense for 2006 was higher than 2005 by approximately 349 million the increase in interest expense in 2006 compared to 2005 was also due to higher debt levels during 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of borrowings incurred to fund the acquisitions of sybron dental and vision 

  

interest income of 61 million 80 million and 147 million was recognized in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively average invested cash balances were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 due to employing cash balances to complete several acquisitions in late 2006 and throughout 2007 as well as to repurchase shares of company common stock in 2007 in addition lower interest rates prevailing during 2007 contributed to the decrease in interest income average invested cash balances decreased during 2006 compared to 2005 due to employing cash balances to complete several acquisitions in 2005 and 2006 to finance repurchases of the company’s outstanding common stock in the second half of 2005 and to repay the previously outstanding eurobonds in july 2005 in addition 2005 interest income reflects the collection of 46 million of interest on a note receivable which had not previously been recorded due to collection risk 

income taxes 

general 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below and changes in tax laws the tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations is reflected in the period in which they occur the company’s effective tax rate for 2007 differs from the united states federal statutory rate of 35 primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the united states no provisions for united states income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states the amount of united states income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings as of december 31 2007 the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states was approximately 54 billion 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for potential tax contingencies based on these reviews and the result of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit reserves are adjusted as necessary however future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company’s estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved additionally the jurisdictions in which the company’s earnings andor deductions are realized may differ from current estimates 

yearoveryear changes in tax provision and effective tax rate 

the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on january 1 2007 as a result of the implementation of interpretation no 48 the company recognized a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 63 million which was accounted for as an increase to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings 

the company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was 258 224 and 273 respectively 

the effective tax rate for 2007 of 258 reflects net discrete tax benefits of approximately 21 million or 007 per diluted share new tax legislation that was signed into law in several taxing jurisdictions during 2007 most notably in germany and denmark reduced income tax rates for 2008 and future periods which resulted in a reduction in the company’s deferred tax liabilities and a like reduction in 2007 income tax expense as required under sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes the lower statutory rates are expected to be offset by other statutory changes in these jurisdictions such that the companys effective tax rate in future years will not be materially reduced as a result of the legislation partially offsetting the benefit from the above tax rate reduction was the effect of establishing income tax reserves during the year related to uncertain tax positions in various taxing jurisdiction net of the reduction of tax reserves associated with sweden refer to note 13 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

the companys effective tax rate from continuing operations of 224 for 2006 was 49 lower than the effective tax rate for 2005 the effective tax rate for 2006 benefited by 69 million or 021 per diluted share as a result of the reduction of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are now expected to be realized the favorable resolution of examinations of certain previously filed returns which resulted in the reduction of previously provided tax reserves and the impact of a change in german tax law which entitles the company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits these positive impacts were partially mitigated by a higher effective tax rate applicable to the second quarter 2006 gain on the sale of shares of first technology plc see note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements which increased the overall provision by 15 million compared to what would have been incurred using the company’s overall effective tax rate 

the effective tax rate for 2008 is expected to be approximately 27 

inflation 

inflation did not significantly impact the company’s overall results of operations in either 2007 or 2006 

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the fair value of fixedrate longterm debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basispoint increase in interest rates at december 31 2007 the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt excluding the lyons would decrease by approximately 74 million the lyons have not been included in this calculation as the value of the convertible debt is primarily derived from the lyons conversion feature this methodology has certain limitations and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the company’s results of operations or financial condition under current accounting principles in january 2002 the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the 250 million aggregate principal amount of 61 notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of 100 million whereby the effective interest rate on 100 million of these notes is the six month libor rate plus approximately 0425 in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended the company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges these instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges other than the above noted swap arrangements there were no material derivative financial instrument transactions during any of the periods presented additionally the company does not have significant commodity contracts or other derivatives 

exchange rate risk 

although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements the eurobond notes described below as well as the european component of the 

  

commercial paper program which as of december 31 2007 had aggregate outstanding borrowings in an amount equivalent to 969 million provide a natural hedge to a portion of the company’s european net asset position 

credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments the company anticipates however that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments the company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 operating activities 

the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes pension funding decisions and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flow from continuing operations a key source of the company’s liquidity was approximately 17 billion for 2007 an increase of 169 million or approximately 11 as compared to 2006 earnings growth contributed 105 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2007 compared to 2006 operating cash flows during 2007 benefited from increases in noncash depreciation and amortization charges of approximately 53 million compared to 2006 the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily related to recent acquisitions also benefiting operating cash flows during 2007 is 68 million of noncash acquisition related charges incurred primarily related to acquired inprocess research and development activities acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of tektronix because this expense adversely impacts net earnings but does not require the use of cash it positively impacts the comparison of operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings operating working capital contributed approximately 38 million to the increase in operating cash flow during 2007 as compared to 2006 the increase in operating working capital is primarily a result of improvements in the company’s inventory turnover and days payables outstanding in 2007 these improvements were somewhat offset by an increase in income tax payments related to continuing operations of approximately 74 million during 2007 as compared to 2006

the company’s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside the united states the company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed wherever possible cash management is centralized and intracompany financing is used to provide working capital to the company’s operations most of the cash balances held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would potentially be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted or prohibited by local laws where local restrictions prevent an efficient intracompany transfer of funds the company’s intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both

in connection with three past acquisitions the company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts in the future as additional purchase price the company enters into these types of arrangements to 

  

help bridge differences of opinion that the company and the sellers may have over the appropriate value of the acquired business the company could pay nothing in the aggregate over the next three years pursuant to these agreements or a maximum of up to 438 million over the next three years depending on the performance of the respective businesses during the specified performance period 

other offbalancesheet arrangements 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters the company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions however the company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

due to the company’s downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions restructuring plans or otherwise certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity

critical accounting policies 

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the company believes the following critical accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies refer to note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments the company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the company’s customers and the company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments the company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control as a result such fluctuations can be difficult to predict if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 the accounting standard for goodwill which requires that the company on an annual basis calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status in calculating the fair value of the reporting units management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed during the fourth quarter of 2007 did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value for each of the company’s reporting units as of september 30 2007 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 11 million to approximately 23 billion in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this 

  

hypothetical 10 decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from a short fall of approximately 10 million to an excess of approximately 21 billion for each of the company’s reporting units the reporting unit that resulted in a short fall of fair value as compared to carrying value based on a 10 hypothetical change in fair value had 188 million of recorded goodwill at the date of the impairment analysis 

longlived assets  the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value judgments made by the company relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in the expected use of the assets changes in economic conditions changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of longlived assets there is risk that the carrying value of the company’s longlived assets may require adjustment in future periods if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates longlived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

purchase accounting  in connection with its acquisitions the company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 953 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination the company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized the company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process the company’s experience in acquiring other companies and information obtained after the closing about the acquired company’s business assets and liabilities the accruals established by the company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business if the accruals established by the company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity the company would be required to incur an expense which would adversely affect the net earnings to the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances 

risk insurance  the company carries significant deductibles and selfinsured retentions with respect to various business risks the business risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers compensation and general liability which includes product liability for domestic workers’ compensation and general liability risk the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses stop loss insurance and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the selfinsured retention these reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists for workers compensation and by outside risk insurance experts for product liability in addition outside risk experts recommend reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims by evaluating the companys specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of december 31 2007 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate if the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

environmental  the company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmentalrelated personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries the company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites if the company determines that potential remediation liability for properties currently or previously owned is probable and reasonably estimable it accrues the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site the company also estimates its exposure for environmentalrelated personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims 

  

become known while the company actively pursues insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the company’s involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations as such there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates of environmental liabilities will not change refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information if the environmental reserves established by the company are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

contingent liabilities  the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of our products claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes the company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable the company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and if appropriate recognizes a liability for these contingencies with the assistance of legal counsel and if applicable other experts these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the company’s settlement strategy for a discussion of these contingencies including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

sharebased compensation  effective january 1 2006 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas no 123r which requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted including stock options rsus and restricted stock based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date sfas no 123r supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation and accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 the company has adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires the company to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of december 31 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings awards granted after december 31 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r the company recognizes equitybased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award prior to 2006 the company accounted for stockbased compensation in accordance with apb 25 using the intrinsic value method which did not require that compensation cost be recognized for the company’s stock options provided the option exercise price was established at 100 of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected life of the sharebased payment awards and stock price volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate 

  

the equitybased compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

pension and other postretirement benefits  certain of the company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans pension plans and certain eligible retirees are provided health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans postretirement plans the company accounts for its pension and postretirement plans in accordance with sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions sfas no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and sfas no 158  employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas no 87 and sfas no 106 require that the amounts the company records including the expense or income associated with the pension and postretirement plans is computed using actuarial valuations 

calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations these include assumptions the company makes relating to financial market and other economic conditions changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used by the company the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include discount rates expected return on plan assets rate of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors while the company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the company’s financial position or results of operations for the united states plan the company used a 60 discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at december 31 2007 which represents an increase of 025 in the discount rate from december 31 2006 for nonus plans rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the us and nonus net obligation by 62 million 40 million on an after tax basis from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2007 

for 2007 the expected longterm rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the united states plan was estimated at 80 which is the same as the rate used in 2006 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the us plan invests between 60 and 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities the balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds pension expense for the us plan for the year ended december 31 2007 was 13 million or 8 million on an aftertax basis compared with 17 million or 11 million on an aftertax basis for this plan in 2006 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 05 pension expense for 2007 would have increased 30 million or 20 million on an aftertax basis the company made no contributions to the us plan in 2007 and is not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan in 2008 the company’s nonus plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the nonus plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 075 to 75 for 2007 and ranged from 25 to 65 for 2006 

the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 158 effective in the year ended december 31 2006 for a summary of the material provisions of sfas no 158 see “new accounting standards” the adoption of sfas no 158 in 2006 decreased the company’s minimum pension liability by 130 million 91 million net of tax benefits due to the recognition of previously unrecognized overfunded positions in certain of the company’s nonus pension plans the company also recorded other comprehensive income of 10 million 65 million net of tax benefits due to the recognition of actuarially determined prior service credits associated with the company’s us based retiree benefit program as of december 31 2007 approximately 120 million 81 million net of tax benefits of aggregate unrecognized prior service credits and unrecognized actuarial losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the company’s pension plans in addition as of december 31 2007 approximately 57 million 39 million net of tax of aggregate unrecognized prior service credits and unrecognized actuarial losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the company’s postretirement plans 

  

the us pension protection act of 2006 was enacted august 17 2006 while the act will have some effect on specific plan provisions in the company’s retirement program its primary effect will be to change the minimum funding requirements for plan years beginning in 2009 based on initial projections the act is expected to slightly increase the amount of our required contributions in 2009

we completed the acquisition of tektronix inc on november 21 2007 we consider the transaction material to company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition through december 31 2007 and believe that the internal controls and procedures of tektronix have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting due to the close proximity of the completion date of the acquisition to the date of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management excluded the tektronix business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 tektronix an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of the company accounted for 33 billion and 28 billion of the company’s total and net assets respectively and 133 million and 62 million of the company’s revenues and net loss respectively for the year then ended

the following discussions of raw materials intellectual property competition seasonal nature of business backlog employee relations research and development government contracts regulatory matters international operations major customers and other matters include information common to all of our segments 

raw materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including steel copper cast iron electronic components aluminum plastics and other petroleumbased products we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world there have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business although market forces during the past two years have caused significant increases in the costs of steel and petroleumbased products and with respect to the past year nonferrous metals as well while nonferrous metals and to a lesser extent certain types of steel remain subject to supply constraints we believe that we will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at reasonable costs 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time however we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to danaher or its subsidiaries 

competition 

although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since our competitors do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the diversity of products sold and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies that have greater sales marketing research and financial resources than we do the number of competitors varies by product line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets served key competitive factors typically include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business as well as price quality delivery speed service and support innovation distribution network and brand name 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and endmarkets that they serve for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products and sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

backlog 

backlog is generally not considered a significant factor in our businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of our products 

employee relations 

at december 31 2006 we employed approximately 45000 persons of which approximately 21000 were employed in the united states of these united states employees approximately 2700 were hourlyrated unionized employees we also have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements or union contracts in other countries though we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory we are subject to potential union campaigns work stoppages union negotiations and other potential labor disputes 

  

research and development 

the table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three fiscal years by segment and in the aggregate 

 

 we conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products and services and improving existing products and services in particular we emphasize the development of new products that are compatible with and build upon our manufacturing and marketing capabilities 

government contracts 

we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense product identification water quality and motion businesses as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements reductions in federal spending and other factors we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts including requirements related to procurement integrity export control employment practices the accuracy of records and the recording of costs our failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts criminal or civil sanctions administrative penalties or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time for a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

environmental health  safety 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with our operations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition to environmental compliance costs we from time to time incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and nonus environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous wastes require cleanup and other possible remedial action including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have made a provision for environmental remediation and environmentalrelated personal injury claims we generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with 

  

similar sites if we determine that we have potential remediation liability for properties currently owned or previously sold we accrue the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site we also estimate our exposure for environmentalrelated personal injury claims and accrue for this estimated liability as such claims become known while we actively pursue appropriate insurance recoveries as well as appropriate recoveries from other potentially responsible parties we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realization is deemed probable the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations as such we cannot assure that our estimates of environmental liabilities will not change 

in view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect we believe that our liability related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow for a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical devices 

certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration the “fda” and by the counterpart agencies of the nonus countries where our products are sold some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the united states 

pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fda regulates virtually all phases of the manufacture sale and distribution of medical devices including their introduction into interstate commerce manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping pursuant to the fdca and fda regulations certain facilities of our operating subsidiaries are registered with the fda as medical device manufacturing establishments the fda as well as our iso notified bodies regularly inspect our registered andor certified facilities 

we sell both class i and class ii medical devices a medical device whether exempt from or cleared pursuant to the premarket notification requirements of the fdca or cleared pursuant to a premarket approval application is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the fda to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements including but not limited to product labeling requirements and limitations including those related to promotion and marketing efforts current good manufacturing practices and quality system requirements record keeping and medical device adverse event reporting for a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the fda and counterpart agencies of other countries please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition certain of our products utilize radioactive material we are subject to federal state and local regulations governing the management storage handling and disposal of these materials 

export compliance 

we are required to comply with various export control and economic sanctions laws including 

 

  

  

 nonunited states governments have also implemented similar export control regulations which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to export control and economic sanctions laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as overall us and nonus economic and industry conditions a global economic slowdown geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism international conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers establish relationships with new customers continually develop new products and services designed to maintain our leadership position in various product categories and penetrate new markets our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues profitability and cash flow and pricing pressures may adversely impact our profitability 

technologies product offerings and customer requirements in many of our markets change rapidly if we fail to keep up with these changes we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs and demand for our products may decline if we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted customers may not buy our products or use our services 

rapid technological change and frequent introductions of new products and services characterize many of the markets we serve changes in regulations can also impact demand for new products in our markets our failure to successfully embrace and respond to these changes and developments may reduce our revenues and cash flow and adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully embrace and respond to these changes and developments we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition if customers do not adopt the technologies that we develop or if those technologies ultimately prove not to be viable our revenues cash flow and profitability may suffer 

our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital conversely any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course some of which may be material during 2006 we acquired eleven businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 27 billion including transaction costs and net of cash acquired during 2005 we acquired 13 businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 885 million including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and during 2004 we acquired 13 businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 16 billion including transaction costs and net of cash acquired our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial managerial and operational challenges including the following any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 conversely we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings in addition changes in accounting or regulatory requirements could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of each of their companies before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

the resolution of contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold such as lawsuits product liability claims and environmental matters and agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and avoid claims of infringement or misuse of third party intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our operations the steps we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated or circumvented unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations in addition from time to time in the usual course of business we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation in the event of a successful claim against us we could lose our rights to needed technology or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights any of which could adversely impact our revenues profitability and cash flows even where we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters commercial disputes environmental matters and acquisitionrelated matters some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition operations and results of operations moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the us and abroad in connection with our operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our 

  

financial condition results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

in addition to the environmental regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental entities at the federal state and local levels including the following 

 

  

  

 in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials competition money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition or performance of key distributors resellers and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors resellers and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition or performance could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results from those businesses effectively implement the danaher business system throughout our organization and achieve the cost savings and other benefits that the effective implementation of the danaher business system can achieve and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

cyclical economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our businesses operate in industries that have historically experienced periodic downturns which have adversely impacted demand for the equipment and services that we manufacture and market any downturn or competitive pricing pressures in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations in addition certain of our customers receive reimbursement from government insurance programs for some of the costs of the products that they purchase from us any significant change in any of these regulations or reimbursement programs could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices changes in currency exchange rates and commodity prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our business and financial results will suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase for example although there have been no recent raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business market forces during the past two years have caused significant increases in the costs of steel and petroleumbased products and with respect to the past year nonferrous metals as well 

in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed our production requirements or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs 

we have a number of domestic collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements while we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs 

international economic political legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in 2006 approximately 49 of our sales were derived outside the us and we continue to increase our sales outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the us our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations and could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and overall growth including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates and the majority of plan assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities which are affected by market risks significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact our future operating results

parties for some of these claims these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures we believe that the results of these litigation matters and other pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on our cash flows or financial condition even before taking into account any related insurance or indemnification recoveries 

we maintain third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts we carry significant deductibles and selfinsured retentions under our insurance policies and our management believes that we maintain adequate accruals to cover the retained liability our management determines our accrual for selfinsurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported

competition

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as overall us and nonus economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism international conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economicbusiness conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products 

our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive because of the diversity of products sold and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers establish relationships with new customers continually develop new products and services designed to maintain our leadership position in various product categories and penetrate new markets our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues profitability and cash flow and pricing pressures may adversely impact our profitability 

technologies product offerings and customer requirements in many of our markets change rapidly if we fail to keep up with these changes we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs and demand for our products may decline 

rapid technological change and frequent introductions of new products and services characterize many of the markets we serve changes in regulations can also impact demand for new products in our markets our failure to successfully embrace and respond to these changes and developments may reduce our revenues and cash flow and adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully embrace and respond to these changes and developments we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital conversely any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course some of which may be material during 2005 2004 and 2003 we acquired 13 13 and 12 businesses respectively our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial managerial and operational challenges including the following any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 conversely we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings in addition changes in accounting or regulatory requirements could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of their company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

the resolution of contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold such as lawsuits product liability claims and environmental matters and agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and avoid claims of infringement or misuse of third party intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our operations the steps we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated or circumvented unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations in addition from time to time in the usual course of business we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation in the event of a successful claim against us we could lose our rights to needed technology or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights any of which could adversely impact our revenues profitability and cash flows even where we are successful in defending claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the us and abroad in connection with our operations there can be no assurance that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

in addition we may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or 

  

other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances for additional information regarding these risks please refer to “item 1 business – regulatory matters” there can be no assurance that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

in addition to the environmental regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental entities at the federal state and local levels including the following 

 

  

  

 in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation 

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial monetary and nonmonetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation 

cyclical economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our businesses operate in industries that have historically experienced periodic downturns which have adversely impacted demand for the equipment and services that we manufacture and market any downturn or competitive pricing pressures in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period 

foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices changes in currency exchange rates and commodity prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our business and financial results will suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient 

  

quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed our production requirements or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs 

we have a number of domestic collective bargaining units and various foreign collective labor arrangements while we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs 

international economic political legal accounting and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in 2005 approximately 47 of our sales were derived outside the us and we continue to increase our sales outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the us our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in foreign operations and could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates and the majority of plan assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities which are affected by market risks significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact our future operating results

danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations approximately 47 of danaher’s sales were derived outside the united states in 2005 as a global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industry economic and political factors however danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of its product sales and services has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future in addition the company’s order rates are highly indicative of the company’s future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance in those industry segments where the company is a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the company’s customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 

while differences exist among the company’s businesses the company generally continued to see broadbased market expansion during 2005 but at lower rates than in 2004 management believes that this moderation in growth rates reflects more difficult comparisons with the company’s 2004 fiscal periods which were strong for the company by historical standards as well as slower growth in technology end markets and current global economic conditions 

consolidated sales for 2005 increased approximately 160 over 2004 sales from existing businesses for the year references to “sales from existing businesses” in this report include sales from acquired businesses starting from and after the first anniversary of the acquisition but exclude currency effect contributed approximately 45 growth acquisitions accounted for approximately 115 growth the impact of currency translation on sales was negligible for the year as the strengthening of the us dollar in the second half of the year offset weakness of the us dollar in the first half of the year 

the growth in sales resulting from acquisitions in 2005 primarily relates to acquisitions in the company’s medical technologies business the company established its medical technologies business through the acquisitions of radiometer as and substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of the gendex business of dentsply international inc in january 2004 and kaltenbach  voight gmbh kavo in may 2004 the medical technologies business has provided a foundation for additional sales and earnings growth as the company has acquired additional companies to complement the initial medical technologies businesses during 2005 the company acquired four medical technologies businesses the largest being the acquisition of leica microsystems ag in august 2005 leica microsystems is a leading global provider of life sciences instrumentation and had annual revenues of approximately 540 million in 2004 excluding the approximately 120 million of revenue attributable to the semiconductor business that has been divested the company’s medical technologies business is expected to continue to provide sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company both through expansion of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses 

the company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in the markets and geographies served the company’s performance will be impacted by its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and 

  

geographies served including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force consolidation of competitors the expansion of market opportunities in asia and recent increases in raw material costs the company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner with the formation of the medical technologies business in 2004 and expansion of this business in 2005 the company is devoting significant attention to the successful integration and restructuring of these acquired businesses 

although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes a substantial portion of its sales are derived from foreign countries sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates which are outside of the control of management the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and profit in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

as noted above the impact of currency trends in the company’s international businesses during 2005 when compared to 2004 was negligible for the full year despite fluctuations during periods within the year the following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the recent strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies applying the exchange rates in effect at december 31 2005 to the translation of the financial statements for the company’s nonus operations for 2005 would result in approximately 13 lower overall company sales than what was actually reported using the rates in effect during this reporting period any further strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would have a further adverse impact on the company’s reported sales and results of operations

components of sales growth 

 

 2005 compared to 2004 

as detailed in the table above segment sales increased 275 for 2005 compared to 2004 price increases which are included in sales from existing businesses contributed less than 1 to overall sales growth compared to 2004 sales from existing businesses increased in all three of the company’s strategic lines of business with the highest growth resulting from the electronic test and environmental water quality businesses sales in the company’s environmental and retail petroleum automation business were up low single digits for the year the company’s dental equipment businesses were essentially flat compared with the period of ownership in 2004 but showed midsingle digit growth for the fourth quarter of 2005 and on a full year pro forma basis when compared with the prior year 

operating profit margins for the segment were 179 in 2005 compared to 187 for 2004 operating profit margins in the segment for 2005 compared with 2004 were adversely impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions principally leica microsystems and kavo these recent acquisitions operate at lower overall operating profit margins than the segment’s ongoing businesses in addition 2005 operating profit margins for the segment reflect additional costs associated with restructuring actions within the dental business which generally commenced in the third quarter of 2005 operating profit margins for 2005 were also impacted by higher expense levels to support strategic growth initiatives in certain businesses ongoing cost reduction initiatives through the application of the danaher business system lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period partially offset these adverse impacts the ongoing application of the danaher business system in each of the segment’s businesses the company’s lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage from anticipated sales growth are all expected to further improve operating margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses including leica microsystems and kavo in future periods but are expected to be offset to varying extents by continued investments in growth and restructuring initiatives in particular the company expects that operating margins in its dental businesses will improve in 2006 as the company’s integration activities in those businesses take hold 

overview of businesses within professional instrumentation segment 

environmental sales from the company’s environmental businesses representing approximately 44 of segment sales for 2005 increased approximately 125 in 2005 compared to 2004 sales from existing businesses accounted for approximately 50 growth acquisitions accounted for approximately 75 growth the impact of currency translation was negligible for 2005 compared to 2004 

the company’s hachlange water quality businesses reported highsingle digit growth in 2005 primarily driven by midsingle digit growth in laboratory sales and lowdouble digit growth in process instrumentation sales in both the united states and european markets new product launches in 2005 positively impacted process instrumentation sales the business’ sales in china also grew over 35 in 2005 on a yearoveryear basis the company’s hach ultra analytics business reported midsingle digit growth in 2005 driven primarily by highsingle digit growth in the us partially offset by slowing sales in electronics endmarkets and in europe sales growth from acquired businesses primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of trojan technologies in november 2004 and two smaller water quality businesses during 2005 

the gilbarco veederroot environmental and retail petroleum automation business reported lowsingle digit sales growth for 2005 compared to 2004 the business experienced growth in sales of environmental equipment in asia and latin america sales in europe were down compared to 2004 due in part to the fact that 2004 sales included the impact of a large shipment sales in the us were flat compared to 2004 

electronic test sales from the company’s electronic test businesses representing approximately 25 of segment sales for 2005 grew 160 compared to 2004 sales from existing businesses accounted for 65 growth acquisitions accounted for 85 growth and favorable currency translation accounted for 10 growth 

  

sales growth from existing businesses for 2005 built on strong performance experienced by this business throughout 2004 key contributors to the 2005 growth included strength in the us and european industrial and electrical channels in each case driven by strong demand for recently introduced product offerings sales in china also showed strong growth during 2005 the company’s networktest business reported flat sales growth for 2005 compared to a very strong 2004 the business’s 2004 results benefited from delivery of a large shipment in the fourth quarter of 2004 for test equipment to service a telecommunication customer 

medical technologies sales from the company’s medical technologies business representing approximately 31 of segment sales for 2005 increased 755 compared to 2004 sales from existing businesses contributed approximately 25 growth during 2005 acquisitions accounted for 750 growth unfavorable currency translation accounted for a 20 sales decline as described above the company established the medical technologies business with the acquisitions of radiometer and gendex in the first quarter of 2004 and added to this business with the acquisition of kavo in may 2004 the acquisition of leica microsystems ag in august 2005 as well as the acquisition of three smaller dental and medical instrumentation products companies during 2005 

radiometer’s business experienced midsingle digit growth for 2005 over the comparable period of 2004 this performance was primarily the result of growth in north america and japan driven by placements of recently introduced products and related accessory sales offset by weaker performance in europe 

sales from existing businesses in the company’s dental businesses experienced midsingle digit growth in fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 for the full year 2005 the dental businesses sales growth was flat for the period of ownership but would have reported midsingle digit growth on a full year pro forma basis had they been included for a full year in both 2005 and 2004 sales for 2005 were negatively impacted by changes in german reimbursement regulations as well as the reduction in promotional activity in 2005 while the business restructured certain german operations which occurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 sales for 2005 benefited from strong growth experienced with the introduction of a new digital imaging product offering in the second half of 2005 the business also experienced sales growth due to the third quarter launch of a sensor line with us distribution as well as strong sales growth at pelton  crane the company’s newest dental acquisition 

the results of leica microsystems have been reflected in the company’s results of operations since its acquisition in august 2005 leica microsystems had annual revenues from continuing operations of approximately 540 million in 2004 excluding approximately 120 million of revenue attributable to the semiconductor equipment business that has been divested leica microsystems’ current gross margins approximate the company’s overall gross margins and are not expected to dilute gross margins in future periods however leica microsystems operating profit margins are below the company and segment average and will be dilutive in the nearterm the company expects to enhance the business’ operating margins through the application of the danaher business system 

2004 compared to 2003 

sales of the professional instrumentation segment increased approximately 530 in 2004 compared to 2003 largely as a result of sales from acquired businesses which contributed approximately 405 of the overall increase sales from existing businesses for this segment contributed approximately 85 growth compared to 2003 principally from sales increases in the environmental and electronic test and measurement businesses price increases which are included as a component of sales from existing businesses contributed less than 1 to overall sales growth compared to 2003 favorable currency translation impact accounted for approximately 40 of the overall sales increase 

operating profit margins for the segment were 187 in 2004 flat compared to 2003 operating profit margin improvements in the company’s existing operations were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses primarily kavo which diluted segment margins compared with 2003 the company continues to pursue ongoing cost reductions through application of the danaher business system and lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives which are expected to further improve operating margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses in future periods 

overview of businesses within professional instrumentation segment 

environmental  sales from the company’s environmental businesses increased approximately 160 in 2004 compared to 2003 acquisitions accounted for approximately 30 growth sales from existing businesses provided 90 growth and favorable currency translation provided 40 growth 

sales were positively impacted by continued strength in the gilbarco veederroot retail petroleum equipment business gilbarco veederroot delivered low doubledigit growth rates for the full year 2004 but slowed to a midsingle digit growth rate on a comparable basis during the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of comparisons with the higher sales levels that began in the fourth quarter of 2003 in addition growth rates for the first quarter of 2004 benefited from the comparison to the softness experienced in the first quarter of 2003 prior to the iraq war strength in sales of retail automation and leakdetection equipment in the us europe and china were the primary drivers of the growth from existing businesses 

  

hachlange’s sales growth from existing businesses also contributed to the increase with high singledigit growth hachlange achieved higher thanmarket growth in both the laboratory and process instrumentation markets in both the us and to a lesser extent europe and also experienced continued strength in china the company’s hach ultra analytics business reported accelerated growth in the second half of 2004 driven by strong us and asian sales the business benefited from strength in the electronics and food and beverage end markets 

electronic test  electronic test sales grew 195 during 2004 compared to 2003 acquisitions accounted for approximately 75 growth revenues from existing businesses provided 85 growth and favorable currency translation provided 35 growth 

yearoveryear growth rates in the second half of 2004 declined somewhat from the rates reported in the first half of 2004 the decline is the result of lapping stronger sales quarters which began for this business in the second half of 2003 as well as a result of the expiration of a multiyear resale agreement relating to a lowmargin product line growth resulted from strength in the us industrial channel the european electrical channel and overall strong growth in china the company’s networktest business achieved 20 growth during the year reflecting continued strength in network analysis copper and fiber equipment sales and strong enterprise market share gains the business also benefited from delivery of a large order in the fourth quarter of 2004 for test equipment to service a telecommunication customer’s next generation service offerings 

medical technologies  all of the medical technologies sales growth represents acquisition related growth as this line of business was established in 2004 with the acquisitions of radiometer gendex and kavo radiometer’s critical care diagnostics business experienced growth across all major geographies driven by strong instrument placements and related accessory sales radiometer’s high single digit sales growth was somewhat offset by the kavo and gendex dental unit business which was impacted by significant preacquisition sales incentive programs in the united states and japan implemented by the former owners 

industrial technologies 

the industrial technologies segment encompasses two strategic businesses product identification and motion and three focused niche businesses power quality aerospace and defense and sensors  controls 

industrial technologies segment selected financial data 

 

  

   

2005 compared to 2004 

as detailed in the above table sales of the industrial technologies segment increased 110 in 2005 over 2004 sales from existing businesses increased due primarily to sales growth in the product identification and aerospace and defense businesses sales from existing businesses for the company’s motion businesses were flat during 2005 compared to 2004 price increases which are included as a component of sales from existing businesses contributed less than 1 to overall sales growth compared to 2004 the first quarter 2005 acquisition of linx printing technologies plc together with several other smaller acquisitions in 2005 accounted for a 60 increase in segment sales the impact of currency translation in the year was negligible 

operating profit margins for the segment were 147 in 2005 including the effect of a 155 million charge 05 to settle litigation associated with activities of a business that occurred prior to the company’s ownership of the business under us generally accepted accounting principles the impact of this settlement is required to be accounted for in 2005 since the settlement occurred after december 31 2005 but before the release of the financial statements refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information operating profit margins were 146 in 2004 the improvements in operating profit margins for the year reflect additional leverage from sales growth ongoing cost reductions associated with our danaher business system initiatives completed during 2004 and 2005 primarily within the company’s motion businesses and margin improvements in businesses acquired in prior years which typically have higher cost structures than the company’s existing operations operating margin also benefited from a 46 million pretax gain on the sale of a small business which occurred in the second quarter of 2005 these positive impacts were partly offset by a 5 million impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2005 related to a minority investment the dilutive effects of operating margins from businesses recently acquired and higher expense levels to support strategic growth and restructuring initiatives primarily in the product identification and motion businesses the ongoing application of the danaher business system in each of the segment’s businesses and the company’s lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives are both expected to further improve operating margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses in the segment in future periods 

overview of businesses within industrial technologies segment 

product identification the product identification businesses accounted for approximately 28 of segment sales in 2005 sales from the company’s product identification businesses increased 260 in 2005 compared to 2004 existing businesses provided 95 growth acquisitions accounted for 160 growth and favorable currency impacts accounted for approximately 05 growth 

sales of marking systems equipment and related service within the videojet business for 2005 increased at midsingle digit rates over 2004 this marking systems growth primarily resulted from strength in the north american china and latin american markets the company also continued to see growth in both its laser product offerings and thermotransfer overlay product offerings the company’s increased sales and marketing efforts implemented earlier in 2005 also contributed to this growth in addition growth in sales from existing operations for 2005 were driven by strong systems installation sales within the accusort scanning business particularly sales to the united states postal service usps the company expects accusort’s sales to decline in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of completing this large usps project in early 2006 

motion sales in the company’s motion businesses representing approximately 34 of segment sales in 2005 increased approximately 25 compared to the same period of 2004 sales from existing businesses were flat compared with prior year levels acquisitions accounted for approximately 25 growth in sales and the impact of currency translation was negligible 

sales from existing businesses slowed from strong 2004 levels the business continued to experience strength in its electric vehicle product line although at lower growth rates than experienced in 2004 as well as growth in the aviation and defense market in addition the elevator endmarket showed continued strength in 2005 however the business experienced softness in the technology and electronic assembly end markets in 2005 

focused niche businesses the segment’s niche businesses in the aggregate showed 100 sales growth in 2005 compared to 2004 growth in the existing businesses was primarily driven by sales growth from the company’s aerospace and defense businesses principally the electrooptical and safety product lines as well as strength in the company’s power quality businesses these improvements were partially offset by slight declines in the company’s sensors and controls business due to a slowing technology market and more difficult comparisons with the business’ 2004 results which were strong by historical standards 2005 sales were negatively impacted by 10 due to the sale of a small business in june 2005 for which previously reported sales have not been restated 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

sales of the industrial technologies segment increased approximately 215 in 2004 compared to 2003 sales from existing businesses for this segment contributed approximately 9 to the overall growth compared to 2003 driven by sales increases in all businesses with particularly strong sales increases in the company’s motion businesses price increases which are included as a component of sales from existing businesses were negligible compared to 2003 acquisitions contributed approximately 95 to the growth during the year driven in large part by acquisitions within the company’s product identification business the impact of favorable currency translation generated approximately 3 growth compared to 2003 

operating profit margins for the segment were 146 in 2004 compared to 145 in 2003 the overall improvement in operating profit margins for 2004 was driven primarily by additional leverage from sales growth ongoing cost reductions associated with danaher business system initiatives and reductions in manufacturing costs through lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives implemented during 2004 and 2003 margin improvements were partially offset by lower margins associated with the startup stage of new business initiatives with certain oems in the company’s motion business 

overview of businesses within industrial technologies segment 

product identification  for 2004 product identification revenues grew 385 compared to 2003 with acquisitions providing 290 growth favorable currency impacts of approximately 35 and sales from existing operations providing 60 growth 

growth in sales from existing businesses was broadbased across the product portfolio the growth was driven by strong equipment sales primarily continuous inkjet printer sales in china and north america but increasingly in the laser thermal transfer overprint and binary array product offerings yearoveryear growth rates for the second half of 2004 were somewhat lower compared with the growth rates in the first half of 2004 reflecting the normalization of revenues associated with the 2003 willett acquisition as well as continued integration activities related to recent acquisitions the reading and scanning business acquired in late 2003 also experienced growth primarily from systems installation projects with the united states postal service 

motion  sales in the company’s motion businesses grew 20 in 2004 compared to 2003 as sales from existing businesses contributed 130 to the overall reported growth acquisitions provided growth of 35 and favorable currency translation effects provided 35 growth 

the growth in sales from existing businesses was broadbased both geographically and across the markets served the north american market for direct drive products and the worldwide semiconductor and flatpanel display markets demonstrated particular strength during 2004 and contributed significantly to the businesses’ overall growth the business experienced a significant increase in sales associated with electric vehicle projects won in prior periods and believes it captured market share in 2004 as many motion control applications have shifted to the use of ac motor technology solutions the company’s linear actuator product businesses continued to grow in 2004 primarily resulting from strong market growth for ball screw and gearbox product offerings in both north america and europe 

focused niche businesses  the segment’s niche businesses in the aggregate showed 16 sales growth in 2004 primarily from highsingle digit growth from existing businesses largely attributable to the company’s sensors  controls and aerospace  defense businesses and to a lesser extent due to the impact of acquisitions in the company’s aerospace and defense businesses

components of sales growth 

 

 2005 compared to 2004 

sales in the tools  components segment decreased 10 in 2005 compared to 2004 the 2005 period sales were negatively impacted by 50 on a yearoveryear basis due to the sale of a small business in late 2004 for which previously reported sales have not been restated sales from existing businesses contributed approximately 40 growth for the segment in 2005 including approximately 20 growth due to price increases that the company implemented as a result of cost increases in steel and other commodities there were no acquisitions in this segment during 2004 or 2005 and currency impacts on sales were negligible in both periods 

mechanics’ hand tools sales representing approximately twothirds of segment sales in 2005 grew approximately 40 in 2005 compared with 2004 the sales growth was driven primarily by sales growth in the group’s highend mobile tool distribution business which experienced lowdouble digit growth during the year driven by increases in both the number of distributors and their average purchase levels mechanics’ hand tools also experienced significant growth in 2005 in the china market the business’ retail mechanics’ hand tools business declined at lowsingle digit levels during 2005 compared with 2004 the integration of sears and kmart a major customer of the segment tempered the business’ 2005 sales growth the company believes the merger of sears and kmart may result in further reductions to searskmart’s inventory levels during the first half of 2006 the segment’s niche businesses also experienced midsingle digit growth during 2005 due primarily to strength in the truck box and engine retarder businesses 

operating profit margins for the segment were 154 in 2005 compared to 152 in 2004 the improvement in operating profit margins for 2005 primarily relates to the pricing initiatives implemented to offset a portion of the steel and other commodity cost increases experienced beginning in 2004 the impact of higher sales levels and the impact of danaher business system cost reduction programs implemented in 2004 and 2005 and the impact of a gain recorded on the sale of real estate totaling 53 million 39 million after taxes during the first quarter of 2005 these improvements more than offset the incremental costs associated with closing one of the segment’s manufacturing facilities the company incurred approximately 11 million in costs associated with this plant closure in 2005 this plant closure provided minimal benefit to operating margins in 2005 but is expected to contribute to earnings in 2006 the ongoing application of the danaher business system in each of the segment’s businesses and the company’s lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives are all expected to further improve segment operating margins in future periods 

2004 compared to 2003 

sales in the tools  components segment grew 90 in 2004 compared to 2003 sales volumes from existing businesses contributed 95 and were offset slightly by the impact of a small divestiture during 2004 price increases which are included as a component of sales from existing businesses contributed less than 1 to reported revenue there were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2004 or 2003 and currency impacts on revenues were negligible in both periods 

sales in the mechanics hand tools business grew approximately 85 for the year driven primarily by increases in sales from the group’s retail hand tool product lines highend mobile distribution business and industrial distribution businesses the company’s matco business grew at low doubledigit rates for 2004 which the company believes outpaced the overall market growth the company’s engine retarder and chuck businesses also experienced low doubledigit growth rates the other niche businesses within the segment also experienced mid to highsingle digit growth rates during 2004 

operating profit margins for the segment were 152 in 2004 compared to 145 in 2003 this improvement was driven by leverage on increased sales volume and the impact of cost reduction programs implemented in 2003 and 2004 offset partially by increases in price and surcharges related to steel purchases incurred in the third quarter price increases were implemented to recover a portion of the increase in raw material costs the company commenced a plant closing in the fourth quarter of 2004 which reduced overall operating profit for 2004 by about 5 million 

  

gross profit 

 

 gross profit margins for 2005 improved 110 basis points to 431 from 420 in 2004 this improvement resulted primarily from generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired leverage on increased sales volume the ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by our dbs processes and lowcost region initiatives and cost reductions in recently acquired business units in addition selected increases in selling prices and recent reductions of commodity costs also contributed to gross profit expansion partly offsetting these improvements are the costs associated with closing a manufacturing facility in the tools  components segment referred to above gross profit could be negatively impacted in future periods by higher raw material costs and supply constraints resulting from the improving overall economy or any significant slowdown in the economy 

gross profit margins for 2004 improved 160 basis points to 420 compared to 404 in 2003 this improvement resulted primarily from leverage on increased sales volume in addition gross profit margins benefited from generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired principally radiometer and the ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by the company’s dbs processes and lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives increases in cost and surcharges related to steel purchases partially offset these improvements 

operating expenses 

 

 the yearoveryear increases in selling general and administrative expenses are due primarily to the impact of recently acquired businesses principally kavo and leica microsystems in 2005 and radiometer and kavo in 2004 and their higher relative operating expense structures additional spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the company and the increased proportion of sales derived from our international operations which generally have higher operating expense structures compared to the company as a whole in addition selling general and administrative expenses for 2005 reflect a charge for settlement of preacquisition litigation refer to note 18 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

gain on pension plan curtailment 

the company recorded a curtailment gain in 2003 as a result of freezing substantially all associates’ ongoing participation in its cash balance plan effective december 31 2003 the gain totaled 225 million 146 million after tax or 005 per share and represented the unrecognized benefits associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining service period of the participating associates prior to freezing the plan the company will continue recording pension expense related to this plan primarily representing interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and amortization of actuarial losses accumulated in the plan prior to the curtailment 

  

interest costs and financing transactions 

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness please refer to “–liquidity and capital resources – financing activities and indebtedness” below interest expense for 2005 was lower than the prior year by approximately 101 million the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower debt levels in 2005 as a result of the repayment of the company’s 625 eurobond notes and to a lesser extent lower borrowing rates on new borrowings during the period 

interest expense of 55 million in 2004 was approximately 4 million lower than the corresponding 2003 period the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to the cessation of amortization of deferred financing costs related to the company’s lyons offset slightly by the unfavorable impact of the eurous dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the company’s 4068 million of 625 eurobond notes which were subsequently repaid in the third quarter of 2005 

interest income of 147 million 76 million and 101 million was recognized in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively during the second quarter of 2005 the company collected 46 million of interest on a note receivable which had not previously been recorded due to collection risk see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition higher overall interest rates in 2005 compared to 2004 increased interest income from prior year levels average invested cash balances decreased in 2004 compared with the 2003 levels due to deploying these cash balances to complete several acquisitions the decline in interest income as a result of these lower invested cash balances was partially offset by the company maintaining a higher proportion of available cash in international markets which had higher overall interest rates and higher shortterm rates in 2004 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2005 of 273 was 22 percentage points lower than the 2004 effective rate mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2005 compared to 2004 the company also resolved examinations of certain previously filed us and international tax returns and provided additional reserves for other matters arising during the third fiscal quarter of 2005 resolution of these matters resulted in a small benefit from the reversal of previously provided tax reserves the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be approximately 265 

the 2004 effective tax rate of 295 was 31 percentage points lower than the 2003 effective rate mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of nonus earnings in 2004 compared to 2003 as well as the impact of changes made to the company’s international tax structure primarily related to the acquisition and integration of radiometer and kavo during 2004 

the company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities material audit assessments and changes in tax laws the tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations is reflected in the period in which they occur the company’s effective tax rate in 2005 2004 and 2003 differed from the united states federal statutory rate of 35 primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the united states united states income taxes have not been provided on earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states the amount of united states income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings as of december 31 2005 the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states was approximately 21 billion the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act provided the company with an opportunity to repatriate up to 500 million of foreign earnings during 2005 at an effective us tax rate of 525 the company did not repatriate any foreign earnings under the provisions of the act 

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for potential tax contingencies based on these reviews and the result of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit reserves are adjusted as necessary however future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company’s estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved additionally the jurisdictions in which the company’s earnings andor deductions are realized may differ from current estimates 

inflation 

other than increases in commodity pricing noted above the effect of inflation on the company’s operations has been minimal in 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 

interest rate risk 

the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basispoint increase in interest rates at december 31 2005 the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt would decrease by approximately 4 million this methodology has certain limitations and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the company’s results of operations or financial condition under current accounting principles in january 2002 the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the 250 million aggregate principal amount of 6 notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of 100 million whereby the effective interest rate on 100 million of these notes is the six month libor rate plus approximately 0425 in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended the company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges these instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges other than the above noted swap arrangements there were no material derivative financial instrument transactions during any of the periods presented additionally the company does not have significant commodity contracts or other derivatives 

exchange rate risk 

the company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products globally as a result it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its nonus operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk the company’s previously outstanding eurobond notes which were repaid in the third quarter of 2005 provided a natural hedge to a portion of the company’s european net asset position 

credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments the company anticipates however that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments the company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the company’s customers the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 operating activities 

the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis operating cash flow a key source of the company’s liquidity was approximately 12 billion for 2005 an increase of 171 million or approximately 165 as compared to 2004 earnings growth contributed 152 million to the increase in operating cash flow in the 2005 compared to 2004 depreciation and amortization accounted for 21 million of the improvement in cash flow 

  

on a yearover year basis operating working capital which the company defines as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable also favorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison cash used for accounts receivable decreased by 43 million during 2005 compared to 2004 this decrease primarily relates to significant increases in accounts receivable in 2004 as a result of an accelerating sales environment in addition the company realized higher cash flow benefits from accounts payable compared to 2004 primarily as a result of the timing of vendor payments these improvements were partially offset by cash used for inventory to support growing sales levels which used 88 million more cash in 2005 compared to 2004 inventory turns improved on a yeartoyear basis driven particularly by improvements in newly acquired businesses the timing of tax payments and changes in deferred taxes in 2005 compared to 2004 negatively impacted cash flow by 17 million for 2005 compared to 2004 in addition timing related increases in prepaid expenses associated with the timing of payments for certain of the company’s benefit programs including 401k and employee health plan contributions negatively impacted 2005 cash flow

as discussed below the company completed several business acquisitions and divestitures during 2005 2004 and 2003 all of the acquisitions during this time period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the company’s financial statements this goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses are expected to bring to existing operations for a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see notes 2 and 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

financing activities and indebtedness 

financing activities used cash of 512 million during 2005 compared to 38 million used during the comparable period of 2004 primarily for the repurchase of common stock and the repayment of indebtedness 

on april 21 2005 the company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of the company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions there is no expiration date for the company’s repurchase program the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the company’s 1998 stock option plan and for other corporate purposes 

during 2005 the company repurchased 5 million shares of company common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of 2577 million the repurchases were funded from available cash and from borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit at december 31 2005 the company had 5 million shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing board authorization the company expects to fund any further repurchases using the company’s available cash balances or existing lines of credit 

total debt was 1042 million at december 31 2005 compared to 1350 million at december 31 2004 this decrease was due primarily to repayment of 362 million of the company’s eurobonds as required upon maturity in july 2005 this decrease was partially offset by 104 million in borrowings net of repayments associated with the purchase of leica microsystems described above and by the accretion of amounts due under the lyons discussed below 

the company’s debt financing as of december 31 2005 was comprised primarily of 580 million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due 2021 “lyons” 250 million of 6 notes due 2008 subject to the interest rate swaps described above and 177 million of borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit 

during the first quarter of 2001 the company issued 830 million value at maturity in lyons the net proceeds to the company were 505 million of which approximately 100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions the lyons carry a yield to maturity of 2375 holders of the lyons may convert each of their lyons into 145352 shares of danaher common stock in the aggregate for all lyons approximately 120 million shares of danaher common stock at any time on or before the maturity date of january 22 2021 as of december 31 2005 the accreted value of the outstanding lyons was 48 per share which at that date was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion the company may redeem all or a portion of the lyons for cash at any time holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash andor company common stock at the company’s option on january 22 2011 the holders had a similar option to require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of january 22 2004 which resulted in notes with an accreted value of 11 million being redeemed by the company for cash the company will pay contingent interest to the holders of lyons during any sixmonth period commencing after january 22 2004 if the average market price of a lyon for a measurement period preceding such sixmonth period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such lyon the company has not and is not currently required to pay contingent interest under this agreement except for the contingent interest described above the company will not pay interest on the lyons prior to maturity 

the company maintains two revolving senior unsecured credit facilities totaling 1 billion available for general corporate purposes borrowings under the revolving credit facilities bear interest of eurocurrency rate plus 021 to 070 depending on the company’s 

  

debt rating the credit facilities each 500 million have a fixed term expiring june 28 2006 and july 23 2006 respectively there were no borrowings outstanding under either of the company’s credit facilities at any time during 2004 or 2005 the company expects to enter into a new credit facility in 2006 

the company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt however a downgrade in the company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company’s credit facilities also a downgrade in the company’s credit rating could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude the company’s ability to consider commercial paper as a potential source of financing 

the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of 002 per share payable on january 27 2006 to holders of record on december 31 2005 aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2005 were 216 million 

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2005 the company held 316 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less as of december 31 2005 the company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments including limitations on secured debt and debt levels in addition as of the date of this form 10k the company could issue up to 1 billion of securities under its shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 

the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions to pay interest and service debt fund its pension plans as required pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the company’s common stock in order to meet these cash requirements the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds the company currently anticipates that any acquisitions consummated during 2006 would be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the establishment of a commercial paper program through borrowings under its credit facilities under uncommitted lines of credit or by accessing the capital markets the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy both shortterm and longterm requirements 

the company’s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would potentially be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds the company’s intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both the company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

pension and other post retirement  employee benefit plans 

due to declines in the equity markets in 2001 and 2002 the fair value of the company’s united states pension fund assets decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the plan in addition certain of the company’s nonunited states plans are underfunded as a result in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” the company has recorded a minimum pension liability of 1755 million 1160 million net of tax benefits cumulatively through december 31 2005 the minimum pension liability is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined accumulated benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets as of september 30 2005 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2005 for additional information this adjustment results in a direct reduction of stockholders’ equity and does not immediately impact net earnings but is included in other comprehensive income loss 

calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations these assumptions include discount rates expected return on plan assets rate of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors while the company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the company’s financial position or results of operations for the united states plan the company used a 55 discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at december 31 2005 which represented a decrease in the discount rate of 025 from the rate used at december 31 2004 for nonus plans rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan a further 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the aftertax minimum pension liability 94 million 68 million on an aftertax basis from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2005 

for 2005 the expected longterm rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the united states plan was estimated at 80 which reflects a 50 basis point reduction from the rate used in 2004 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the plan maintains between 60 to 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities the balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds pension expense for the us plan for the year 

  

ended december 31 2005 was 81 million or 59 million on an aftertax basis compared with 43 million or 30 million on an aftertax basis for this plan in 2004 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was reduced by an additional 050 pension expense for 2005 would have increased 22 million or 16 million on an aftertax basis while the company was not required to make a contribution to the plan in 2005 it made a voluntary contribution of 10 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 the company is not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan in 2006 the company’s nonus plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 30 to 75 for 2005

 standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the company’s obligations under shortterm contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements 

in connection with four separate past acquisitions the company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts in the future as additional purchase price the company could pay nothing in the aggregate over the next five years pursuant to these agreements or a maximum of up to 472 million over the next five years depending on the future performance of the respective businesses 

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities the company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions however the company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

due to the company’s downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions restructuring plans or otherwise certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity

the company carries significant deductibles and selfinsured retentions for workers’ compensation property automobile product and general liability costs and management believes that the company maintains adequate accruals to cover the retained liability management determines the company’s accrual for selfinsurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported for more information regarding how the company determines reserves for certain selfinsurance liabilities see “critical accounting policies – risk insurance” the company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts

for a discussion of risks related to environmental health and safety laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments the company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the company’s customers and the company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments the company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control as a result such fluctuations can be difficult to predict if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company would be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur the company follows statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 the accounting standard for goodwill which requires that the company on an annual basis calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status in calculating the fair value of the reporting units management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

  

the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 did not result in an impairment charge the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of the company’s reporting units as of october 1 2005 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 130 million to approximately 28 billion in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately 100 million to approximately 24 billion for each of the company’s reporting units 

longlived assets  the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value judgments made by the company relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in the expected use of the assets changes in economic conditions changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of longlived assets there is risk that the carrying value of the company’s longlived assets may require adjustment in future periods if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates longlived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

purchase accounting  in connection with its acquisitions the company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 953 “recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination” the company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized the company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process the company’s experience in acquiring other companies and information obtained after the closing about the acquired company’s business assets and liabilities the accruals established by the company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business if the accruals established by the company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity the company would be required to incur an expense which would adversely affect the company’s results of operations to the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances 

risk insurance  the company carries significant deductibles and selfinsured retentions with respect to various business risks the business risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers’ compensation and product liability for domestic workers’ compensation and product liability risk the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to the retained liability these reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists for workers’ compensation and by outside risk insurance experts for product liability in addition outside risk experts recommend reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims by evaluating the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of december 31 2005 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

environmental the company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmentalrelated personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the company and its subsidiaries the company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites if the company determines that it has potential remediation liability for properties currently owned or previously sold it accrues the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site the company also estimates its exposure for environmentalrelated personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims become known while the company actively pursues appropriate insurance recoveries as well as appropriate recoveries from other potentially responsible parties it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the company’s involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations as such there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates of environmental liabilities will not change refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

contingent liabilities the company is from time to time subject to routine litigation incidental to its business these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the company’s products allegations of patent and trademark infringement and trade secret misappropriation and litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes the company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable the company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and if appropriate recognizes a liability for these contingencies with the assistance of legal counsel and if applicable other experts these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the company’s settlement strategy for a discussion of these contingencies including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the following discussions of raw materials intellectual property competition seasonal nature of business backlog employee relations research and development government contracts regulatory matters international operations and major customers include information common to all of the company’s segments 

  

raw materials 

  

the company’s manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including steel copper cast iron electronic 

  

components aluminum and plastics and other petroleumbased products the company purchases raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world there have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on the company’s business although market forces have caused significant increases in the costs of certain raw materials such as steel and petroleumbased products while certain raw materials such as steel and certain electrical components remain subject to supply constraints danaher believes that it will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at reasonable costs 

  

intellectual property 

  

the company owns numerous patents and trademarks and has also acquired licenses under patents and trademarks owned by others although in aggregate the company’s intellectual property is important to its operations the company does not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time however the company does engage in litigation to protect its patents and trademarks any of the company’s patents trademarks or other proprietary rights could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may not provide significant competitive advantages all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to the company or its subsidiaries 

  

competition 

  

although the company’s businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets its competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since its competitors do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as the company because of the diversity of products sold and the variety of markets served the company encounters a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies that have greater sales marketing research and financial resources than danaher the number of competitors varies by product line management believes that danaher has a market leadership position in many of the markets served key competitive factors typically include price quality delivery speed service and support innovation product features and performance knowledge of applications distribution network and brand name 

  

seasonal nature of business 

  

general economic conditions have an impact on the company’s business and financial results and certain of the company’s businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and endmarkets that they serve for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter sales to original equipment manufacturers “oems” are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products and sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter however as a whole the company is not subject to material seasonality 

  

backlog 

  

backlog is generally not considered a significant factor in the company’s businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products 

  

employee relations 

  

at december 31 2004 the company employed approximately 35000 persons of which approximately 17000 were employed in the united states of these united states employees approximately 3000 were hourlyrated unionized employees the company also has governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements or union contracts in other countries though the company considers its labor relations to be good it is subject to potential union campaigns work stoppages union negotiations and other potential labor disputes 

  

research and development

government contracts 

  

the company has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense product identification water quality and motion businesses as a result the company is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts the company’s agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements reductions in federal spending and other factors the company is also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts including requirements related to procurement integrity export control employment practices the accuracy of records and the recording of costs a failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts criminal or civil sanctions administrative penalties or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 

  

regulatory matters 

  

environmental health  safety 

  

certain of the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with its operations the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

in addition to environmental compliance costs the company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority the company has received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and foreign environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where the company and others disposed of hazardous wastes require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may be the basis for monetary sanctions including sites where the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations the company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations in particular joslyn manufacturing company “jmc” a subsidiary of the company acquired in september 1995 and the assets of which were divested in november 2004 previously operated wood treating facilities that chemically preserved utility poles pilings railroad ties and wood flooring blocks these facilities used wood preservatives that included creosote pentachlorophenol and chromiumarseniccopper all such treating operations were discontinued or sold prior to 1982 while preservatives were handled in accordance with then existing law environmental law now imposes retroactive liability in some circumstances on persons who owned or operated woodtreating sites jmc is remediating some of its former sites and will remediate other sites in the future in connection with the divestiture of the assets of jmc jmc retained the environmental liabilities described above and agreed to indemnify the buyer of the assets with respect to certain environmentalrelated liabilities the company is also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

  

the company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmentalrelated personal injury claims however there can be no assurance that estimates of these liabilities will not change the company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites if the company determines that it has potential remediation liability for properties currently owned or previously sold it accrues the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site the company also estimates its exposure for environmentalrelated personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims become known while the company actively pursues appropriate insurance recoveries as well as appropriate recoveries from other potentially responsible parties it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the company’s involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and 

  

regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations as such there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates of environmental liabilities will not change in view of the company’s financial position and reserves for environmental matters and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect the company believes that its liability if any related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or cash flow 

  

medical devices 

  

certain of the company’s products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration the “fda” and by the counterpart agencies of the foreign countries where its products are sold some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the united states the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable medical device regulations 

  

pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fda regulates virtually all phases of the manufacture sale and distribution of medical devices including their introduction into interstate commerce manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping pursuant to the fdca and fda regulations certain facilities of the company’s operating subsidiaries are registered with the fda as medical device manufacturing establishments the fda and the company’s iso notified bodies regularly inspect the company’s registered andor certified facilities government regulatory actions for violations of the fdca can result in recalls seizures injunctions administrative detentions civil monetary penalties criminal sanctions and fines suspension or withdrawal of approvals premarket notification rescissions and warning letters

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements 

  

overview 

  

danaher corporation derives its sales from the design manufacture and marketing of industrial and consumer products which are typically characterized by strong brand names proprietary technology and major market positions in three business segments professional instrumentation industrial technologies and tools  components 

  

the company strives to create shareholder value through 

  

   

   

   

to accomplish these goals the company uses a set of tools and processes known as the danaher business system “dbs” which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality delivery cost and innovation the company will acquire businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business the extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect the company’s overall growth and operating results the company also acquires businesses that it believes can help it achieve the objectives described above 

  

danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations and approximately 45 of 2004 sales derived outside the united states as a global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industry economic and political factors however danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of its product sales and services has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the outlook for the company the company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future in addition the company’s order rates are highly indicative of the company’s future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance in those industry segments where the company is a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the company’s customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 

  

while differences exist among the company’s businesses the company’s markets generally strengthened in the second half of 2003 and remained strong throughout 2004 consolidated revenues for 2004 increased approximately 30 over 2003 acquisitions accounted for approximately 185 growth favorable currency translation primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro contributed approximately 25 growth and revenues from existing businesses for the year defined as businesses that have been part of the company for each comparable period reported excluding currency effect contributed 9 growth during 2004 the company acquired radiometer as substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the gendex business of dentsply international inc and kaltenbach  voigt gmbh kavo which together form the core of a new medical technology business the medical technology business which is included in the company’s professional instrumentation segment is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company both through growth of its existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses while the company continues to see broadbased strength across most of its businesses and end markets based on current order rates certain businesses are expected to experience moderating growth in 2005 due to current global economic conditions a slowing semiconductor market and more difficult comparisons with the 2004 periods which were very strong by historical standards 

  

the company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in most of the markets and geographies served the company’s performance will be impacted by its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies served including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force consolidation of competitors and the expansion of market opportunities in asia the company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner with the formation of the medical technology business noted above the company is devoting significant attention to the successful integration of these acquired businesses into the organization 

  

although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes a substantial portion of its sales are derived from foreign countries sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates which are outside of the control of management as noted above the company benefited from the impact of favorable currency trends in its international businesses during 2004 when compared to 2003 the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and profit in the consolidated financial statements while currency rates continued to produce positive comparisons on a year over year basis strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies could adversely impact the company’s results of operations 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the past three years

2004 compared to 2003 

  

segment overview 

  

sales of the professional instrumentation segment increased approximately 52 in 2004 compared to 2003 largely as a result of sales from acquired businesses which contributed approximately 395 of the overall increase sales from existing businesses for this segment contributed approximately 85 growth compared to 2003 principally from sales increases in the environmental and electronic test and measurement businesses price increases which are included in sales from existing businesses contributed less than 1 to overall sales growth compared to 2003 favorable currency translation impact accounted for approximately 4 of the overall sales increase 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 187 in 2004 flat compared to 2003 operating profit margin improvements in the company’s existing operations were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses primarily kavo which diluted segment margins by approximately 200 basis points compared with 2003 the company continues to pursue ongoing cost reductions through application of the danaher business system and lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives which are expected to further improve operating margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses in future periods 

  

business overview 

  

environmental  sales from the company’s environmental businesses representing approximately 49 of segment sales in 2004 increased approximately 16 in 2004 compared to 2003 acquisitions accounted for approximately 3 growth sales from existing businesses provided 9 growth and favorable currency translation provided 4 growth 

  

sales were positively impacted by continued strength in the gilbarco veederroot retail petroleum equipment business gilbarco veederroot delivered low doubledigit growth rates for the full year 2004 but slowed to a midsingle digit growth rate on a comparable basis during the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of comparisons with the higher sales levels that began in the fourth quarter of 2003 in addition growth rates for the first quarter of 2004 benefited from the comparison to the softness experienced in the first quarter of 2003 prior to the iraq war strength in sales of retail automation and leakdetection equipment in the us europe and china were the primary drivers of the growth from existing businesses yearoveryear growth rates in this business are expected to continue slowing in early 2005 as a result of the significant sales growth experienced in early 2004 

  

hachlange’s sales growth from existing businesses also contributed to the increase with high singledigit growth hachlange achieved higher thanmarket growth in both the laboratory and process instrumentation markets in both the us and to a lesser extent europe and also experienced continued strength in china the company’s hach ultra analytics business reported accelerated growth in the second half of 2004 driven by strong us and asian sales the business continues to benefit from strength in the electronics and food and beverage end markets the acquisition of trojan technologies in november 2004 establishes the business line’s drinking and waste water disinfection market position and is expected to generate approximately 100 million in incremental sales for the business in 2005 

  

electronic test  electronic test sales representing approximately 28 of segment sales in 2004 grew 195 during 2004 compared to 2003 acquisitions accounted for approximately 75 growth revenues from existing businesses provided 85 growth and favorable currency translation provided 35 growth 

  

yearoveryear growth rates in the second half of 2004 on a daysadjusted basis declined somewhat from the rates reported in the first half of 2004 the decline is the result of lapping stronger sales quarters which began for this business in the second half of 2003 as well as a result of the expiration of a multiyear resale agreement relating to a lowmargin product line growth resulted from strength in the us industrial channel the european electrical channel and overall strong growth in china the company’s networktest business achieved 20 growth during the year reflecting continued strength in network analysis copper and fiber equipment sales and strong enterprise market share gains the business also benefited from delivery of a large order in the fourth quarter of 2004 for test equipment to service a telecommunication customer’s next generation service offerings 

  

medical technology  medical technology represented approximately 23 of segment sales in 2004 all of this sales growth represents acquisition related growth as this line of business was established in 2004 with the acquisitions of radiometer gendex and kavo radiometer’s critical care diagnostics business experienced growth across all major geographies driven by strong instrument placements and related accessory sales radiometer’s high single digit sales growth was somewhat offset by the kavo and gendex dental unit business which was impacted by significant preacquisition sales incentive programs in the united states and japan implemented by the former owners 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

segment overview 

  

sales of the professional instrumentation segment increased 145 in 2003 compared to 2002 acquisitions provided an 80 increase in segment sales due primarily to the acquisitions of gilbarco and raytek in 2002 as well as the impact of several smaller acquisitions sales from existing businesses for this segment were up approximately 10 in 2003 compared to 2002 principally from sales increases in the company’s environmental businesses prices were essentially flat compared to 2002 favorable currency translation impact generated 55 growth in 2003 compared to 2002 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 187 in 2003 compared to 178 in 2002 operating profit margins for 2002 included approximately 40 basis points of benefit associated with gains on the sale of real estate and adjustments to the restructuring reserves established in 2001 the overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by ongoing cost reductions associated with the company’s dbs initiatives completed during 2003 and margin improvements in recently acquired businesses 

  

business overview 

  

environmental  sales from the company’s environmental businesses representing approximately 65 of segment sales in 2003 increased approximately 155 in 2003 compared to 2002 acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2003 accounted for approximately 75 growth sales from existing businesses provided 2 growth and favorable currency translation provided 6 growth 

  

operations were impacted by strength in the second half of 2003 in the gilbarco veederroot retail petroleum equipment business resulting in part from marketshare gains in the us due to the addition of a number of distributors as a result of financial difficulties of a competitor increased sales to highvolume retailers and strong yearend purchasing activity from major oil companies with respect to both retail automation and environmental systems also contributed to the strength in the second half of 2003 sales from existing businesses in the company’s water quality businesses also contributed to the increase as strength in laboratory instrumentation sales in europe was partially offset by softness in the us laboratory instrumentation and ultrapure markets due to weakness in the semiconductor and electrical assembly markets and due to several large contracts in 2002 not repeating in 2003 

  

electronic test  electronic test sales representing approximately 35 of 2003’s segment sales grew 13 during 2003 compared to 2002 acquisitions principally the raytek corporation acquisition completed in august 2002 provided 9 growth which includes strong sales of raytek’s noncontact temperature measurement and thermal imaging products favorable currency translation provided 5 growth these factors were partially offset by an approximate 1 decline in sales from existing businesses due primarily to softness in telecommunications and data network markets the company’s networktest business strengthened in the second half of 2003 compared to the first half of 2003 to post lowsingle digit declines for the year

operating profit margins for the segment were 148 in 2004 compared to 145 in 2003 the overall improvement in operating profit margins for 2004 was driven primarily by additional leverage from sales growth ongoing cost reductions associated with danaher business system initiatives and reductions in manufacturing costs through lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives implemented during 2004 and 2003 margin improvements were partially offset by lower margins associated with the startup stage of new business initiatives with certain oems in the company’s motion business

the growth in sales from existing businesses continued to be broadbased both geographically and across the markets served the north american market for direct drive products and the worldwide semiconductor and flatpanel display markets demonstrated particular strength during 2004 and contributed significantly to the businesses’ overall growth some general signs of softening in the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets served by the motion businesses have tempered management’s growth expectations with respect to these businesses for 2005 the business has experienced a significant increase in sales associated with electric vehicle projects won in prior periods and believes it has captured market share in 2004 as many motion control applications have shifted to the use of ac motor technology solutions the company’s linear actuator product businesses continued to grow in 2004 primarily resulting from strong market growth for ball screw and gearbox product offerings in both north america and europe growth rates in 2005 are expected to decline from the rates experienced in 2004 as the business begins to compare against these very strong 2004 sales levels and also because of the softening in the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets referred to above

focused niche businesses  the segment’s niche businesses in the aggregate showed 16 sales growth in 2004 primarily from highsingle digit growth from existing businesses largely attributable to the company’s sensors  controls and aerospace  defense businesses and to a lesser extent due to the impact of acquisitions in the company’s aerospace and defense businesses

components of sales growth 

  

   

2004 compared to 2003 

  

sales in the tools  components segment grew 9 in 2004 compared to 2003 sales volumes from existing businesses contributed 95 and were offset slightly by the impact of a small divestiture during the year there were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2004 or 2003 price increases which are included in sales from existing businesses contributed less than 1 to reported revenue currency impacts on revenues were negligible sales in the mechanics hand tools business representing approximately twothirds of segment sales in 2004 grew approximately 85 for the year driven primarily by increases in sales from the group’s retail hand tool product lines mobile distribution business and industrial distribution businesses sellthrough at the group’s major retail customer was in line with the group’s sales to this customer during the period the company’s matco business grew at low doubledigit rates for 2004 which the company believes outpaced the overall market growth the company’s engine retarder and chuck businesses also experienced low doubledigit growth rates the other niche businesses within the segment also experienced mid to highsingle digit growth rates during 2004 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 152 in 2004 compared to 145 in 2003 this improvement was driven by leverage on increased sales volume and the impact of cost reduction programs implemented in 2003 and 2004 offset partially by increases in price and surcharges related to steel purchases incurred in the third quarter price increases have been implemented to recover a portion of the increase in raw material costs the company announced a plant closing in the fourth quarter of 2004 which reduced overall operating profit for 2004 by about 5 million completing the plant closure is expected to cost approximately 6 million in 2005 and as a result there will be minimal benefit to operating margins from this closure in 2005 the company does not expect this closure to have a positive contribution to earnings until 2006 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

sales in the tools  components segment grew approximately 05 in 2003 all of this growth represents growth in sales volume from existing businesses as there were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2002 or 2003 price and currency impacts on sales were negligible mechanics hand tools sales representing approximately twothirds of segment sales in 2003 grew approximately 35 for the year driven primarily by increases in sales from the group’s retail hand tool product lines which rebounded in the second half of 2003 as sales to the group’s largest customer strengthened through the third and fourth quarters of 2003 in addition both the company’s matco and asian distribution channels showed growth for 2003 offsetting these increases was a net sales decline in the segment’s niche businesses as weakness in shipments of truck and industrial boxes drill chucks and poleline hardware driven by weak end markets and increased competition from lowcost competitors was partially offset by revenue 

  

gains in the company’s wheel service equipment product lines also sales of diesel engine retarders fell during 2003 reflecting decreased enduser demand as compared to 2002 in 2002 the business experienced an inventory buildup by customers in advance of regulatory changes implemented in 2002 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 145 in 2003 compared to 152 in 2002 operating profit margins in 2002 benefited by 10 basis points from the reversal of unutilized accruals established for the 2001 restructuring program margin improvements at the jacobs chuck business unit related to the 2001 restructuring program and other cost reductions were offset by margin declines at the delta industries business unit related to the volume decrease noted above the impact of lower engine retarder sales and by spending on certain cost reduction and growth opportunities 

  

gross profit 

  

   

gross profit margins for 2004 improved 160 basis points to 420 compared to 404 in 2003 this improvement results primarily from leverage on increased sales volume in addition gross profit margins were impacted by generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired principally radiometer and the ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by the company’s danaher business system processes and lowcost region sourcing and production initiatives increases in cost and surcharges related to steel purchases partially offset these improvements while gross profit margins improved in 2004 for the reasons stated above these improvements could be negatively affected in future periods by higher raw material costs and supply constraints resulting from the improved overall economy or by any significant slowdown in the economy as indicated above price increases have been implemented to recover some of the increases in raw material costs experienced in 2004 

  

gross profit margin for 2003 was 404 an increase of 140 basis points compared to 390 in 2002 this increase results from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by the company’s danaher business system processes generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired cost reductions in business units acquired during the first quarter of 2002 and the leverage created from higher revenues during the year the company’s restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001 was estimated to have provided approximately 38 million of savings to the full year 2003 when compared against the 2001 period and 19 million when compared against the 2002 period this restructuring was complete at the beginning of 2003 

  

operating expenses 

  

   

in 2004 selling general and administrative expenses were 261 of sales an increase of 120 basis points from 2003 levels this increase is due primarily to additional spending to fund growth opportunities and cost reduction opportunities throughout the company the impact of newly acquired businesses principally radiometer and kavo and their higher relative operating expense structures and the increased proportion of sales derived from the company’s international operations which generally have higher operating expense structures compared to the company as a whole 

  

in 2003 selling general and administrative expenses were 249 of sales an increase of 90 basis points from 2002 levels this increase is due primarily to additional spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the company as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures 

  

gain on pension plan curtailment 

  

the company recorded a curtailment gain in 2003 as a result of freezing substantially all associates’ ongoing participation in its cash balance plan effective december 31 2003 the gain totaled 225 million 146 million after tax or 005 per share and represents the unrecognized benefits associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining service period of the participating associates prior to freezing the plan as discussed in more detail below the company will continue recording pension expense related to this plan primarily representing interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and amortization of actuarial losses accumulated in the plan prior to the above curtailment 

  

interest costs and financing transactions 

  

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness please refer to “–liquidity and capital resources – financing activities and indebtedness” below interest expense of 55 million in 2004 was approximately 4 million lower than the corresponding 2003 period the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the cessation of amortization of deferred financing costs related to the company’s lyons offset slightly by the unfavorable impact of the eurous dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the company’s 4068 million of 625 eurobond notes due 2005 

  

interest expense of 59 million in 2003 was approximately 5 million higher than the corresponding 2002 period the increase in interest expense was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the eurous dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the company’s eurobond notes due 2005 partially offset by reduced debt levels resulting from net repayments of approximately 146 million of outstanding indebtedness during 2003 

  

interest income of 76 million 101 million and 103 million was recognized in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively average invested cash balances decreased in 2004 compared with the levels of 2003 due to employing these cash balances to complete several acquisitions the decline in interest income as a result of these lower invested cash balances was partially offset by the company maintaining a higher proportion of available cash in international markets which have higher overall interest rates and higher shortterm rates in 2004 average invested cash balances grew during 2002 and 2003 but have been largely offset by lower average interest rates earned on these deposits 

  

income taxes 

  

the company’s effective tax rate may be affected by business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities material audit assessments and changes in tax laws the tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations are reflected in the period in which they occur the company’s effective tax rate differed from the united states federal statutory rate of 35 primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the united states united states income taxes have not been provided on earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states and the amount of united states income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings as of december 31 2004 the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states was approximately 16 billion the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act provides the company with an opportunity to repatriate up to 500 million of foreign earnings during 2005 at an effective us tax rate of 525 at the present time the company has no intention to repatriate any foreign earnings under the provisions of the act the company will continue to reevaluate its position throughout the year especially if there are changes or proposed changes in foreign tax laws or in the us taxation of international businesses 

  

the 2004 effective tax rate of 295 was 31 lower than the 2003 effective rate mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of nonus earnings in 2004 compared to 2003 as well as the impact of changes made to the company’s international tax structure primarily related to the acquisition and integration of radiometer and kavo during 2004 the company expects to further reduce its effective tax rate for 2005 to 275 reflecting the continuing benefit of deriving an increasing proportion of the company’s earnings from international operations 

  

the 2003 effective tax rate of 326 was 14 lower than the 2002 effective rate mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 and the impact of additional research and experimentation credits available to reduce the us tax liabilities 

  

the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments the company believes that is has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company’s estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved additionally the jurisdictions in which the company’s earnings andor deductions are realized may differ from current estimates 

  

inflation 

  

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations has been minimal in 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 

  

interest rate risk 

  

the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates the value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basispoint increase in interest rates at december 31 2004 the market value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt would decrease by approximately 13 million this methodology has certain limitations and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the company’s results of operations or financial condition under current accounting principles in january 2002 the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the 250 million aggregate principal amount of 6 notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of 100 million whereby the effective interest rate on 100 million of these notes is the six month libor rate plus approximately 0425 in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended the company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges these instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges 

  

other than the above noted swap arrangements there were no material derivative financial instrument transactions during any of the periods presented additionally the company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives 

  

exchange rate risk 

  

the company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products globally as a result it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the company’s issuance of eurobond notes in 2000 provides a natural hedge to a portion of the company’s european net asset position the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 

  

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments the company anticipates however that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments the company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of its customers the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

  

   

   

   

   

   

operating activities 

  

the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis operating cash flow a key source of the company’s liquidity was 1033 million for 2004 an increase of 172 million or approximately 20 as compared to 2003 earnings growth contributed 209 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003 in addition additional deferred taxes related to 2004’s earnings contributed approximately 19 million to the change in operating cash flows and depreciation and amortization contributed approximately 23 million to the improvement in cash flow on a yearover year basis operating working capital which the company defines as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable unfavorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison between 2004 and 2003 as accounts receivable increased to support the higher sales the company experienced in 2004 operating working capital still made an overall positive contribution to operating cash flow during 2004 due to continued emphasis on inventory management inventory levels decreased approximately 65 million in 2004 versus 2003 reflecting these efforts in both newly acquired businesses as well as the company’s existing operations these improvements were partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses associated with the timing of payments for certain of the company’s benefit programs including 401k and employee health plan contributions 

  

in connection with its acquisitions the company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing duplicate facilities severing redundant personnel and integrating the acquired businesses into existing company operations cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with each acquisition

net cash used in investing activities was 16 billion in 2004 compared to approximately 368 million of net cash used in 2003 gross capital spending of 116 million for 2004 increased 36 million from 2003 due to capital spending relating to new acquisitions and spending related to the company’s lowcost region manufacturing initiatives new products and other growth opportunities 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 368 million in 2003 compared to approximately 11 billion of net cash used in 2002 gross capital spending of 80 million for 2003 increased 15 million from 2002 due to capital spending relating to new acquisitions and spending related to the company’s lowcost region sourcing initiatives capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity replacement of equipment and improving information technology systems in 2005 the company expects capital spending of approximately 150 million although actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately 31 million and 13 million of cash proceeds for 2004 and 2003 

  

in addition as discussed below the company completed several business acquisitions and divestitures during 2004 2003 and 2002 all of the acquisitions during this time period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the company’s financial statements this goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations for a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see notes 2 and 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

financing activities and indebtedness 

  

financing activities used cash of 38 million during 2004 compared to 110 million used during 2003 the reduction in cash used in financing activities was directly related to lower levels of required principal repayments under the company’s outstanding debt obligations between periods 

  

total debt increased to 1350 million at december 31 2004 compared to 1299 million at december 31 2003 this increase was due primarily to change in the us dollareuro exchange rates and the resulting increase in the carrying value of the company’s euro denominated debt the company borrowed and repaid approximately 130 million in shortterm borrowings under an uncommitted financing arrangement to fund the acquisition of kavo during the second quarter of 2004 all significant debt obligations assumed related to 2004 acquisitions have been repaid 

  

the company’s debt financing as of december 31 2004 was composed primarily of 567 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 liquid yield option notes or lyons “lyons” 407 million of 625 eurobond notes due 2005 and 250 million of 6 notes due 2008 subject to the interest rate swaps described above the company’s lyons obligations described in further detail below carry a yield to maturity of 2375 with contingent interest payable as described below substantially all remaining borrowings have interest costs that float with referenced base rates the company maintains two revolving senior unsecured credit facilities totaling 1 billion available for general corporate purposes borrowings under the revolving credit facilities bear interest of eurocurrency rate plus 021 to 070 depending on the company’s debt rating the credit facilities each 500 million have a fixed term expiring june 28 2006 and july 23 2006 respectively there were no borrowings outstanding under either of the company’s credit facilities at any time during 2004 

  

the company’s eurobond notes due in 2005 have been classified as a current obligation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet since the maturity date is within one year from december 31 2004 the company currently anticipates that at maturity the eurobond notes will be satisfied from available cash through the issuance of commercial paper borrowings under existing credit facilities or by accessing the capital markets or through a combination of some or all of these alternatives 

  

during the first quarter of 2001 the company issued 830 million value at maturity in lyons the net proceeds to the company were approximately 505 million of which approximately 100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions the lyons carry a yield to maturity of 2375 holders of the lyons may convert each of their lyons into 145352 shares of danaher common stock in the aggregate for all lyons approximately 120 million shares of danaher common stock at any time on or before the maturity date of january 22 2021 as of december 31 2004 

  

the accreted value of the outstanding lyons was 47 per share which at that date was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion the company may redeem all or a portion of the lyons for cash at any time holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash andor company common stock at the company’s option on january 22 2011 the holders had a similar option to require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of january 22 2004 which resulted in notes with an accreted value of 11 million being redeemed by the company these notes were redeemed for cash the company will pay contingent interest to the holders of lyons during any sixmonth period commencing after january 22 2004 if the average market price of a lyon for a measurement period preceding such sixmonth period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such lyon the company has not and is not currently required to pay contingent interest under this agreement except for the contingent interest described above the company will not pay interest on the lyons prior to maturity 

  

the company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt however a downgrade in the company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company’s credit facilities also a downgrade in the company’s credit rating could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude the company’s ability to consider commercial paper as a potential source of financing 

  

aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2004 were 177 million 

  

cash and cash requirements 

  

as of december 31 2004 the company held approximately 609 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less as of december 31 2004 the company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments including limitations on secured debt and debt levels in addition as of the date of this form 10k the company could issue up to 1 billion of securities under its shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 

  

the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions to pay interest and service debt fund its pension plans as required and to pay dividends to shareholders in order to meet these cash requirements the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds the company currently anticipates that any additional acquisitions consummated during 2005 would be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the establishment of a commercial paper program through borrowings under its credit facilities under uncommitted lines of credit or by accessing the capital markets the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy both shortterm and longterm requirements 

  

the company’s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would potentially be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds the company’s intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both the company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

  

pension fund assets and liabilities 

  

due to declines in the equity markets in 2001 and 2002 the fair value of the company’s pension fund assets decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the plan as a result in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” the company recorded a minimum pension liability reduction of 69 million net of tax expense of 37 million at december 31 2004 the minimum pension liability is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined accumulated benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets as of september 30 2004 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2004 for additional information this adjustment results in a direct credit to stockholders’ equity and does not immediately impact net earnings but is included in other comprehensive income calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations these assumptions include discount rates expected return on plan assets rate of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors while the company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the company’s financial position or results of operations the company used a 575 discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at december 31 2004 which represented a decrease in the discount rate of 025 from the rate used at december 31 2003 a further 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the aftertax minimum pension liability approximately 14 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2004 

  

for 2004 the company estimated the expected longterm rate of return assumption at 85 which is consistent with the rate used in 2003 this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected longterm returns on equity and debt 

  

investments included in plan assets the plan maintains between 60 to 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities the balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds pension expense for this plan for the year ended december 31 2004 was approximately 43 million or 30 million on an aftertax basis compared with 85 million or 57 million on an aftertax basis and excluding the 225 million gain on curtailment recognized in 2003 for this plan in 2003 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was reduced by an additional 50 basis points pension expense for 2004 would have increased approximately 24 million or  17 million on an aftertax basis the company intends on lowering the assumed rate of return on plan assets to 80 for 2005 the company was not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan in 2004 and anticipates there will be no statutory funding requirements for the defined benefit plan in 2005

critical accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments the company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the company’s customers and the company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments the company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

  

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control as a result such fluctuations can be difficult to predict if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company would be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings and financial condition 

  

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur the company follows statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 the accounting standard for goodwill which requires that the company on an annual basis calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status in calculating the fair value of the reporting units management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

  

longlived assets  the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value judgments made by the company relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in the expected use of the assets changes in economic conditions changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of longlived assets there is risk that the carrying value of the company’s longlived assets may require adjustment in future periods if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates longlived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

  

the company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 did not result in an impairment charge the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of the company’s reporting units as of october 2 2004 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 138 million to approximately 26 billion in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease excluding the recently acquired medical technology reporting unit would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately 108 million to approximately 23 billion for each of the company’s reporting units 

  

purchase accounting  in connection with its acquisitions the company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 953 “recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination” the company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized the company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process the company’s experience in acquiring other companies and information obtained after the closing about the acquired company’s business assets and liabilities the accruals established by the company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business if the accruals established by the company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity the company would be required to incur an expense which would adversely affect the company’s results of operations to the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances

environmental and safety regulations 

  

certain of the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with its operations the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

in addition to environmental compliance costs the company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices for example generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority the company has received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state and foreign environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where the company and others disposed of hazardous wastes require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may be the basis for monetary sanctions including sites where the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations the company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations in particular joslyn manufacturing company “jmc” a subsidiary of the company previously operated wood treating facilities that chemically preserved utility poles pilings and railroad ties all such treating operations were discontinued or sold prior to 1982 danaher acquired jmc in september 1995 these facilities used wood preservatives that included creosote pentachlorophenol and chromiumarseniccopper while preservatives were handled in accordance with then existing law environmental law now imposes retroactive liability in some circumstances on persons who owned or operated woodtreating sites jmc is remediating some of its former sites and will remediate other sites in the future in addition the company is from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

  

the company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmentalrelated personal injury claims however there can be no assurance that estimates of environmental liabilities will not change the company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites if the company determines that it has potential liability for properties currently owned or previously sold it accrues the total estimated costs including investigation and remediation costs associated with the site the company estimates its exposure for environmentalrelated personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims become known while the company actively pursues appropriate insurance recoveries as well as appropriate recoveries from other potentially responsible parties it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the company’s involvement in certain sites uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the availability of alternative cleanup methods variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of 

  

 

contribution is possible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations as such there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates of environmental liabilities will not change in view of the company’s financial position and reserves for environmental matters and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect t he company believes that its liability if any related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operation financial condition and cash flow

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

the following discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements 

  

overview 

  

danaher corporation derives its revenue from the design manufacture and marketing of industrial and consumer products which are typically characterized by strong brand names proprietary technology and major market positions in two business segments processenvironmental controls and tools and components as discussed in greater detail below s ubsequent to december 31 2003 the company acquired radiometer as and substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the gendex business of dentsply international inc adding medical technology products to the processenvironmental controls segment for 2004 these businesses the core of a new medical technology platform are expected to provide additional revenue and earnings growth opportunities for the company both through growth of the existing businesses and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses

  

the company strives to create shareholder value through delivering revenue growth excluding the impact of acquired businesses in excess of the overall market growth for its products and services upper quartile financial performance when compared against peer 

  

  

companies and upper quartile cash flow generation from operations to accomplish these goals the company uses a set of tools and processes known as the danaher business system “dbs” which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality delivery cost and innovation the company will also acquire other businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic platform the extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect the company’s overall growth and operating results 

  

as a global business danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide regional and industry economic and political factors however danaher’s geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of its product sales and services has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results for the majority of 2003 market indicators of the global manufacturing economy remained mixed while differences exist among the company’s businesses the company’s markets strengthened in the second half of 2003 and the company experienced strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2003 when compared against the fourth quarter of 2002 given order and revenue trends in december 2003 january and february 2004 we expect the higher level of revenues experienced in the fourth quarter of 2003 adjusted for the seasonality of certain of our businesses to continue into the early part of the 2004 fiscal year 

  

consolidated revenues for 2003 increased approximately 155 over 2002 acquisitions accounted for approximately 10 growth favorable currency translation primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro contributed approximately 4 growth and revenues from existing businesses for the year defined as businesses that have been part of the company for each comparable period reported excluding currency effect contributed 15 growth substantially all of this sales growth from existing businesses occurred in the fourth quarter as the company’s revenues from existing businesses for the first three quarters of 2003 were generally consistent with 2002’s comparable revenues 

  

the company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in most of the markets and geographies served the company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner with the formation of the medical technology platform noted above the company expects to devote significant attention to the successful integration of these acquired businesses into the organization management believes it has the resources to successfully integrate these businesses into the company in addition as noted above the company benefited from the impact of favorable currency trends in its international businesses in 2003 the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of revenue and profit in the consolidated financial statements

segment overview   

sales of the processenvironmental controls segment increased 21 in 2003 compared to 2002 the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of thomson industries and the 2003 acquisition of willett international limited “willett” together with several other smaller acquisitions provided a 14 increase in segment sales this increase was in addition to an approximate 5 favorable currency translation impact sales from existing businesses for this segment were up approximately 2 compared to 2002 principally from sales increases in the motion environmental and product identification businesses prices were essentially flat compared to 2002 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 165 in 2003 compared to 16 in 2002 operating profit margins for 2002 included approximately 40 basis points of benefit associated with gains on the sale of real estate and adjustments to the restructuring reserves established in 2001 the overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by ongoing cost reductions associated with our dbs initiatives completed during 2003 and margin improvements in recently acquired businesses which typically have higher cost structures than the company’s existing operations 

  

business overview   

environmental  revenues from the company’s environmental businesses representing approximately 30 of segment revenue in 2003 increased approximately 155 in 2003 compared to 2002 acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2003 accounted for approximately 75 growth revenues from existing businesses provided 2 growth and favorable currency translation provided 6 growth operations were impacted by strength in the second half of 2003 in the gilbarco veederroot retail petroleum equipment business resulting in part from marketshare gains in the us due to the addition of a number of distributors as a result of financial difficulties of a competitor increased sales to highvolume retailers and strong yearend purchasing activity from major oil companies with respect to both retail automation and environmental systems also contributed to the strength in the second half of 2003 sales from existing businesses in the company’s water quality businesses also contributed to the increase as strength in laboratory instrumentation sales in europe was partially offset by softness in the us laboratory instrumentation and ultrapure markets due to continued weakness in the semiconductor and electrical assembly markets and due to several large contracts in 2002 not repeating in 2003 the us laboratory equipment markets showed strength in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared against the first three quarters of 2003 the business continues to focus on faster growing markets in developing countries such as china to enhance its growth prospects

  

motion  sales in the company’s motion businesses representing approximately 20 of 2003’s segment revenues grew 33 as acquisitions provided growth of 21 primarily from the thomson industries acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 and favorable currency translation effects provided 8 growth to drive this increase the existing businesses’ revenues accounted for 4 growth reflecting share gains in certain of its end markets including electric vehicles and direct drives partially offset by year over year lowsingle digit declines in the company’s linear actuator product businesses resulting from integration of the sales channels associated with the thomson acquisition the company’s linear actuator businesses showed lowsingle digit growth in the fourth quarter representing the first quarter of growth for this business in 2003 reflecting increased shipments for military programs as well as increased sales to the company’s distribution network

  

electronic test  electronic test revenues representing approximately 16 of 2003’s segment revenues grew 13 during 2003 compared to 2002 acquisitions principally the raytek corporation acquisition completed in august 2002 provided 9 growth which includes strong sales of raytek’s noncontact temperature measurement and thermal imaging products favorable currency translation provided 5 growth these factors were partially offset by an approximate 1 decline in sales from existing businesses due primarily to continued softness in telecommunications and data network markets the company’s networktest business strengthened in the second half of 2003 compared to the first half of 2003 to post lowsingle digit declines for the year

  

product identification  in february 2002 the company established its product identification business with the acquisition of videojet technologies in january 2003 willett was added to this business and accusort systems inc was acquired in november 2003 the product identification business accounted for approximately 12 of segment revenues in 2003 for 2003 product identification revenues grew 65 compared to 2002 with the willett and accusort acquisitions providing 55 growth favorable currency impacts of approximately 5 and existing operations providing 5 growth based largely on broad based equipment sales increases

  

focused niche businesses  the segment’s niche businesses in the aggregate showed highsingle digit revenue growth in 2003 primarily from acquisitions in the company’s aerospace and defense and industrial controls businesses 

  

 

2002 compared to 2001 

  

segment overview   

sales of the processenvironmental controls segment increased 29 in 2002 compared to 2001 the acquisitions in february 2002 of gilbarco and videojet technologies as well as several smaller 2001 and 2002 acquisitions provided a 36 increase in segment sales this increase was offset by an 8 unit volume decline in existing businesses a favorable currency translation impact provided a 1 revenue increase and prices were essentially flat compared to 2001 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 160 in 2002 compared to 149 in 2001 approximately 130 basis points of the change in operating margin resulted from the dilutive impact of lower operating margins of the new businesses acquired during 2001 and 2002 additionally margin declines from lower sales volumes at the business units described above and increases in expenditures on growth opportunities in the segment were offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization as of january 1 2002 and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions 

  

business overview   

revenues from the company’s environmental business representing approximately 30 of segment revenue increased over 90 in 2002 compared to 2001 resulting primarily from the acquisitions of gilbarco and viridor in february 2002 and two smaller acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2001 acquisitions provided the entirety of this growth as revenues from existing businesses declined approximately 2 modest growth in the company’s water quality business units was offset by weakness in demand for ultrapure instrumentation brought on primarily by weakness in semiconductor end markets and in veederroot’s leak detection market the company believes geopolitical uncertainties in oilproducing regions contributed to the decline in demand in the end markets served by the gilbarcoveederroot business in 2002 electronic test revenues representing approximately 20 of segment revenues grew 6 during 2002 also due to acquisition activity acquisitions contributed 11 of this growth which was offset by a revenue decline from existing businesses of 5 resulting from weakness in both industrial and network test equipment sales sales in the company’s motion businesses representing approximately 20 of segment revenues declined 3 as a revenue decline from existing businesses of 9 was offset by acquisition growth of 6 continued softness in semiconductor and electronic assembly end market demand was a leading factor in motion’s revenue decline from existing businesses 

  

aerospace and defense revenues increased 7 in 2002 resulting from acquisition activity of 5 and revenue growth from existing businesses of 2 power quality sales declined 28 in 2002 due to a significant decline in end user demand that began in early 2001 and has continued through 2002 sales of the company’s industrial controls product lines fell 7 due to recessionrelated weakness in their served end markets in february 2002 the company established its product identification business with the acquisition of videojet technologies which accounted for approximately 11 of the segment’s growth during 2002 

  

tools and components 

  

the tools and components segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics’ hand tools other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices diesel engine retarders wheel service equipment drill chucks customdesigned headed tools and components hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries and highquality precision socket screws fasteners and miniature precision parts 

  

tools and components selected financial data   

  

   

2003 compared to 2002 

  

revenues in the tools and components segment grew 04 in 2003 the entirety of this growth represents growth in sales volume from existing businesses as there were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2002 or 2003 price and currency impacts on revenues were negligible mechanics hand tools revenues representing approximately twothirds of segment sales in 2003 grew 

  

 

approximately 35 for the year driven primarily by increases in sales from the group’s retail hand tool product lines which rebounded in the second half of 2003 as sales to the group’s largest customer strengthened through the third and fourth quarters of 2003 in addition both the company’s matco and asian distribution channels showed growth for 2003 offsetting these increases was a net sales decline in the segment’s niche businesses as continued weakness in shipments of truck and industrial boxes drill chucks and poleline hardware driven by weak end markets and increased competition from lowcost competitors was partially offset by revenue gains in the company’s wheel service equipment product lines also sales of diesel engine retarders fell during 2003 reflecting decreased enduser demand as compared to 2002 in 2002 the business experienced an inventory buildup by customers in advance of regulatory changes implemented in 2002 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 145 in 2003 compared to 152 in 2002 operating profit margins in 2002 benefited by 10 basis points from the reversal of unutilized accruals established for the 2001 restructuring program margin improvements at the jacobs chuck business unit related to the 2001 restructuring program and other cost reductions were offset by margin declines at the delta industries business unit related to the volume decrease noted above the impact of lower engine retarder sales and by spending on certain cost reduction and growth opportunities the company believes operating profit margins will return to the levels experienced in 2002 as the impact of spending initiatives are expected to yield benefits in 2004 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

revenues in the tools and components segment grew 2 in 2002 the entirety of this growth represents sales volume growth from existing businesses as there were no acquisitions in this segment during 2001 and 2002 and price and currency impacts were negligible mechanics hand tool revenues representing approximately 65 of segment sales grew 2 generated primarily by increases in the matco sales channel as a result of continued market share gains additionally hand tool revenues in the company’s asian channels grew but were offset by declines in domestic retail channels sales of diesel engine retarders at the jacobs vehicle systems business unit increased significantly as oem customers accelerated their 2002 order rates to meet a regulatory deadline diesel engine retarder demand declined sharply following passage of the regulatory deadline in october 2002 increases in this segment in 2002 were offset by declines in the delta and jacobs chuck business units 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 152 in 2002 compared to 113 in 2001 this increase resulted from the effect of higher revenue levels the cessation of goodwill amortization as of january 1 2002 and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions 

  

gross profit   

   

gross profit margin for 2003 was 404 an increase of 140 basis points compared to 390 in 2002 this increase results from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by our dbs processes generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired cost reductions in business units acquired during the first quarter of 2002 and the leverage created from higher revenues during the year the company’s restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001 is estimated to have provided approximately 38 million of savings to the full year 2003 when compared against the 2001 period this restructuring was complete at the beginning of 2003 gross profit margins are expected to improve in 2004 reflecting ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by the company’s dbs processes continued cost savings from lowcost region sourcing initiatives as well as the impact of higher margins from recent acquisitions these improvements could be affected by higher raw material costs and supply constraints resulting from the improving overall economy

  

gross profit margin in 2002 was 390 a 80 basis point increase compared to 382 achieved in 2001 this increase resulted from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program and other improvements in the gross margins of core business units in addition to the effect of slightly higher gross margins of newly acquired businesses 

  

 

operating expenses   

   

in 2003 selling general and administrative sga expenses were 249 of sales an increase of 110 basis points from 2002 levels this increase is due primarily to additional spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the company as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures   in addition sga expenses in 2002 included approximately 20 basis points of benefit associated with gains from the sale of real estate recorded in 2002

  

selling general and administrative expenses in 2002 were 238 of sales an increase of 70 basis points from 2001 levels this increase is due primarily to the effect of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative cost structures partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization effective january 1 2002 and the gains on real estate sales mentioned above 

  

gain on pension plan curtailment   

the company recorded a curtailment gain in 2003 as a result of freezing substantially all associates’ ongoing participation in its cash balance plan effective december 31 2003 the gain totaled 225 million 146 million after tax or 009 per share and represents the unrecognized benefits associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining service period of our participating associates prior to freezing the plan as discussed in more detail below the company will continue recording pension expense related to this plan primarily representing interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and amortization of actuarial losses accumulated in the plan prior to the above curtailment 

  

restructuring charge 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company recorded a charge of 697 million 435 million after tax or 029 per share related to restructuring certain of its product lines principally its drill chuck power quality and industrial controls divisions to improve financial performance the primary objective of the restructuring plan was to reduce operating costs by consolidating eliminating andor downsizing existing operating locations no significant product lines were discontinued a table describing the components of the restructuring accrual is included in note 4 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

this restructuring is estimated to have provided annual pretax cost reduction net of increased costs at other facilities of approximately 38 million of which approximately 50 was realized in 2002 with the full annual benefit realized in 2003 as of december 31 2002 the restructuring program had been substantially completed as planned due to minor changes to the original restructuring plan and to costs incurred being less than estimated in december 2002 the company recorded a benefit related to adjusting its unutilized restructuring reserves by approximately 63 million 41 million after tax or 003 per share 

  

interest costs and financing transactions 

  

for a description of the company’s outstanding indebtedness please refer to “—liquidity and capital resources — financing activities and indebtedness” below interest expense of 59 million in 2003 was approximately 5 million higher than the corresponding 2002 period the increase in interest expense is due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the eurous dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the company’s 378 million of 625 eurobond notes due 2005 partially offset by reduced debt levels resulting from net repayments of approximately 146 million of outstanding indebtedness during 2003 interest expense of approximately 54 million in 2002 was 6 million higher than 2001 

  

interest income of 10 million 10 million and 22 million was recognized in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively average invested cash balances have grown over the period from 2001 to 2003 but have been largely offset by lower average interest rates earned on these deposits 

  

income taxes 

  

the 2003 effective tax rate of 326 is 14 lower than the 2002 effective rate mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 and the impact of additional research and experimentation credits available to reduce the 

  

  

us tax liabilities the company expects to further reduce its effective tax rate for 2004 to 315 reflecting the continuing benefit of deriving an increasing proportion of the company’s earnings from international operations in addition the impact on the company’s effective tax rate resulting from the radiometer acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2004 has not been fully analyzed but the addition of the radiometer business which is based in denmark and has significant operations outside the united states could further reduce the effective tax rate 

  

the 2002 effective tax rate of 340 was 35 lower than the 2001 effective rate mainly due to the effect of adopting sfas no 142 and the resulting cessation of goodwill amortization and also due to a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2002 compared to 2001 

  

in connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit the company adjusted certain income tax related reserves established related to the sale of a previously discontinued operation and recorded a 30 million credit to its fourth quarter 2002 income statement this credit has been classified separately below net earnings from continuing operations since the tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation 

  

inflation 

  

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations has been minimal in 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and credit risk which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities in addition the company’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole

  

the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates the value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basispoint increase in interest rates at december 31 2003 the market value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt would decrease by approximately 17 million this methodology has certain limitations and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the company’s results of operations or financial conditions under current accounting principles in january 2002 the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the 250 million aggregate principal amount of 6 notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of 100 million whereby the effective interest rate on 100 million of these notes is the six month libor rate plus approximately 0425 in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended the company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges these instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges 

  

the company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than 30 countries as a result it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services in particular the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar operating profits are increased or decreased respectively the company’s issuance of eurobond notes in 2000 provides a natural hedge to a portion of the company’s european net asset position the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk

  

other than the above noted swap arrangements there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented additionally the company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments our interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments the company anticipates however that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments the company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to selling to a large number of customers the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate

   •   operating cash flow a key source of the company’s liquidity was 862 million for 2003 an increase of 151 million or approximately 21 as compared to 2002 the increase in operating cash flow was driven primarily by earnings growth as well as continued improvements in the company’s working capital management

financing activities and indebtedness   

financing activities used cash of 110 million during 2003 compared to 516 million generated during 2002 the primary reason for the difference was the company’s issuance of 69 million shares of the company’s common stock in march 2002 proceeds of the common stock issuance net of the related expenses were approximately 467 million the company used the proceeds to repay approximately 230 million of shortterm borrowings incurred in the first quarter of 2002 related to the videojet gilbarco and viridor acquisitions noted above the balance of the proceeds was used for general corporate purposes 

  

total debt decreased to 12988 million at december 31 2003 compared to 13100 million at december 31 2002 this decrease was due primarily to net repayments of 146 million of debt offset in part by the change in the us dollareuro exchange rates and the resulting increase in the carrying value of the company’s euro denominated debt all significant debt obligations assumed related to 2003 acquisitions have been repaid 

  

the company’s debt financing as of december 31 2003 was composed primarily of 555 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 liquid yield option notes or lyons “lyons” 378 million of 625 eurobond notes due 2005 and 250 million of 6 notes due 2008 subject to the interest rate swaps described above the company’s lyons obligations described in further detail below carry a yield to maturity of 2375 with contingent interest payable as described below substantially all remaining borrowings have interest costs that float with referenced base rates the company maintains two revolving senior unsecured credit facilities totaling 1 billion available for general corporate purposes borrowings under the revolving credit facilities bear interest of eurocurrency rate plus 21 to 70 depending on the company’s debt rating the credit facilities each 500 million have a fixed term expiring june 28 2006 and july 23 2006 respectively there were no borrowings outstanding under either of the company’s credit facilities at any time during 2003

  

during the first quarter of 2001 the company issued 830 million value at maturity in lyons the net proceeds to the company were approximately 505 million of which approximately 100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions the lyons carry a yield to maturity of 2375 holders of the lyons may convert each of their lyons into 72676 shares of danaher common stock in the aggregate for all lyons approximately 60 million shares of danaher common stock at any time on or before the maturity date of january 22 2021 the company may redeem all or a portion of the lyons for cash at any time holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash andor company common stock at the company’s option on january 22 2011 the holders had a similar option to require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of january 22 2004 which resulted in notes with an accreted value of 11 million being redeemed by the company these notes were redeemed for cash and therefore this amount has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying financial statements the company will pay contingent interest to the holders of lyons during any sixmonth period commencing after january 22 2004 if the average market price of a lyon for a measurement period preceding such sixmonth period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such lyon except for the contingent interest described above the company will not pay interest on the lyons prior to maturity 

  

cash and cash requirements 

  

as of december 31 2003 the company held approximately ­­­12 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less approximately 772 million of which were used to fund the acquisitions completed subsequent to december 31 2003 noted above as of december 31 2003 the company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments including limitations on secured debt and debt levels none of the company’s debt instruments contain trigger clauses requiring the company to repurchase or pay off its debt if rating agencies downgrade the company’s debt rating in addition as of the date of this form 10k the company could issue up to 1 billion of securities under its shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 

  

the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions to pay interest and service debt fund its pension plans as required and to pay dividends to shareholders in order to meet these cash requirements the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds the company currently anticipates that any additional acquisitions consummated during 2004 would be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through borrowings under its credit facilities under uncommitted lines of credit or by accessing the capital markets 

  

pension fund assets and liabilities 

  

due to declines in the equity markets in 2001 and 2002 the fair value of the company’s pension fund assets has decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the plan in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” the company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of 769 million net of tax benefit of 396 million at december 31 2002 based on changes in actuarial assumptions including the impact of the plan curtailment noted above the minimum pension liability was increased to 1141 million net of tax benefit of 596 million as of december 31 2003 the 

  

 

minimum pension liability is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined accumulated benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets as of september 30 2003 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2003 for additional information this adjustment results in a direct charge to stockholders’ equity and does not immediately impact net earnings but is included in other comprehensive income calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations these assumptions include discount rates expected return on plan assets rate of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors while the company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the company’s financial position or results of operations the company used a 60 discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at december 31 2003 which represented a decrease in the discount rate of 10 from the rate used at december 31 2002 a further 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the aftertax minimum pension liability approximately 18 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2003 

  

for 2003 the company lowered the expected longterm rate of return assumption from 9 to 85 for the company’s defined benefit pension plan reflecting lower expected longterm returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets the plan maintains between 60 to 70 of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities the balance of the asset portfolio is invested in highquality corporate bonds and bond index funds including the effect of this change pension expense for this plan for the year ended december 31 2003 was approximately 85 million or 57 million on an aftertax basis compared with 19 million or 12 million after tax for this plan in 2002 while not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan for 2003 the company contributed 10 million to the plan before december 31 2003 the company anticipates there will be no statutory funding requirements for the defined benefit plan in 2004 

  

as noted above the company curtailed benefits for substantially all associates under the defined benefit plan as of december 31 2003 the company will maintain this curtailed plan for the foreseeable future and as a result will continue to record the effect of changes in discount rates and expected rates of returns on plan assets on both the minimum pension liability recorded as well as the amount of pension expense reflected in the statement of earnings for future periods in addition as part of curtailing benefits under this plan the company expanded benefits under its available defined contribution 401k plan the net effect of these plan changes are expected to increase the company’s total pension expense by approximately 159 million or 109 million after tax for 2004 compared to 2003

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 under 1 longterm debt obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on the company’s balance sheet under gaap

d   primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies performance and operating cost guarantees and estimated environmental remediation costs postretirement health pension obligations deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation liabilities the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these agreements and are largely based upon historical experience

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company has no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 

  

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of certain commercial commitments of the company 

  

   

standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the company’s obligations under shortterm contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements 

  

guarantees reflected in the table above primarily relate to the company’s matco subsidiary which has sold with recourse or provided credit enhancements for certain of its accounts receivable and notes receivable amounts outstanding under this program approximated 75 million 93 million and 92 million as of december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the subsidiary accounts for such sales in accordance with sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities—a replacement of sfas no 125” a provision for estimated losses as a result of the recourse has been included in accrued expenses no gain or loss arose from these transactions 

  

in connection with the company’s acquisition of thomson the company has entered into agreements to pay 15 million over the next 6 years and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to 60 million cash based on the future performance of thomson through december 31 2005 in connection with one of the 2003 acquisitions the company entered into an agreement to pay an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to 368 million in november 2008 based on future performance of the acquired business through november 2008 

  

the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities the company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions however the company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

due to the company’s downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions restructuring plans or otherwise certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

 

except as described above the company has not entered into any offbalance sheet financing arrangements as of december 31 2003 also the company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities as of december 31 2003 

  

other contingent liabilities 

  

certain of the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate the company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the united states and abroad in connection with its operations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in addition to the environmental compliance costs the company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices the company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities in both the united states and abroad to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the factors described above under item 1 business—environmental and safety regulations in addition the company is from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances in view of the company’s financial position and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect the company believes that its liability if any related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous material handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its cash flow in addition t he ongoing cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s cash flows or financial position

critical accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments the company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the company’s customers and the company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments the company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances which would adversely impact the company’s net earnings cash flows and balance sheet

  

inventories  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company’s control as a result such fluctuations can be difficult to predict if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management the company would be required to reduce the value of its inventory which would adversely impact the company’s cash flows and balance sheet

  

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 the new accounting standard for goodwill which requires

  

  

that the company on an annual basis calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status in calculating the fair value of the reporting units management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

  

longlived assets  the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value judgments made by the company relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in the expected use of the assets changes in economic conditions changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of longlived assets there is risk that the carrying value of the company’s longlived assets may require adjustment in future periods if actual fair value is less than the company’s estimates longlived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings

  

purchase accounting  in connection with its acquisitions the company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 953 “recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination” the company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized the company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process the company’s experience in acquiring other companies and information obtained after the closing about the acquired company’s business assets and liabilities the accruals established by the company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information of the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business if the accruals established by the company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity the company would be required to incur an expense which would adversely affect the company’s results of operations to the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances

overview 

  

danaher corporation designs manufactures and markets industrial and consumer products with strong brand names proprietary technology and major market positions in two business segments processenvironmental controls and tools and components the processenvironmental controls segment is a leading producer of environmental products including water quality analytical instrumentation and leak detection systems for underground fuel storage tanks retail petroleum automation products compact professional electronic test tools product identification equipment and consumables and motion position speed temperature pressure level flow particulate and power reliability and quality control and safety devices in its tools and components segment the company is a leading producer and distributor of general purpose mechanics’ hand tools and automotive specialty tools as well as of toolboxes and storage devices diesel engine retarders wheel service equipment drill chucks and hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries 

  

management believes that the company’s future sales growth will come from both core organic growth and acquisitions the company invests significant resources in its organic growth initiatives across its business units additionally the company has completed numerous acquisitions and expects new acquisitions to provide revenue growth in the future during 2003 the company expects its primary served markets to remain essentially flat with the majority of its revenue growth coming from market share gains and geographic expansion 

  

results of operations 

  

summary of sales by business segment 

  

   

processenvironmental controls 

  

the processenvironmental controls segment is comprised of hach company the dr bruno lange group videojet technologies fluke corporation fluke networks gilbarco veederroot company the danaher industrial controls group the danaher motion group including general purpose systems linear motion systems and the specialty motors division gems sensors danaher power solutions qualitrol corporation and the aerospace and defense businesses of pacific scientific and kollmorgen corporation these companies produce and sell compact professional electronic test tools product identification equipment and consumables retail petroleum automation products underground storage tank leak detection systems motion position speed temperature and level instruments and sensing devices power switches and controls communication line products power protection products liquid flow and quality measuring devices quality assurance products and systems safety devices and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

sales of the processenvironmental controls segment increased 29 in 2002 compared to 2001 the acquisitions in february 2002 of gilbarco and videojet technologies as well as several smaller 2001 and 2002 acquisitions provided a 36 increase in segment sales this increase was offset by an 8 unit volume decline in existing businesses a favorable currency translation impact provided a 1 revenue increase and prices were essentially flat compared to 2001 

  

revenues from the company’s environmental business representing approximately 30 of segment revenue increased over 90 in 2002 compared to 2001 resulting primarily from the acquisitions of gilbarco and viridor in february 2002 and two smaller acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2001 acquisitions provided the entirety of this growth as core operations declined approximately 2 modest growth in the company’s water quality business units was offset by weakness in demand for ultrapure instrumentation brought on primarily by weakness in semiconductor end markets and in veederroot’s leak detection market the company believes geopolitical uncertainties in oilproducing regions contributed to the decline in demand in the end markets served by the gilbarcoveederroot business in 2002 electronic test revenues representing approximately 20 of segment revenues grew 6 during 2002 also due to acquisition activity acquisitions contributed 11 of this growth which was offset by a core volume decline of 5 resulting from weakness in both industrial and network test equipment sales sales in the company’s motion businesses representing approximately 20 of segment revenues declined 3 as a core volume decline of 9 was offset by acquisition growth of 6 continued softness in semiconductor and electronic assembly end market demand was a leading factor in motion’s core volume decline 

  

aerospace and defense revenues increased 7 in 2002 resulting from acquisition activity of 5 and core volume growth of 2 power quality sales declined 28 in 2002 due to a significant decline in end user demand that began in early 2001 and has continued through 2002 sales of the company’s industrial controls product lines fell 7 due to recessionrelated weakness in their served end markets in february 2002 the company established its product identification business with the acquisition of videojet technologies which accounted for approximately 11 of the segment’s growth during 2002 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 160 in 2002 compared to 149 in 2001 excluding the impact of the 2001 restructuring program from both 2002 and 2001 margins decreased 07 points from 165 in 2001 to 158 in 2002 approximately 130 basis points of the change in operating margin resulted from the dilutive impact of lower operating margins of the new businesses acquired during 2001 and 2002 additionally margin declines from lower sales volumes at the business units described above and increases in expenditures on growth opportunities in the segment were offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization as of january 1 2002 and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions 

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

sales in 2001 were 7 higher than in 2000 for this segment the fullyear impact of the 2000 acquisitions of american precision industries kollmorgen corporation warner electric motion and acquisitions of several smaller businesses in 2001 provided a 15 increase from 2000 two small product line dispositions in 2001 caused a 2 decrease in 2001 segment sales the remainder of the sales change was generated by a decrease in unit volume of 5 and a 1 negative currency translation impact overall segment prices remained flat for 2001 compared to 2000 

  

revenues from the motion business grew approximately 20 from 2000 levels an increase of 40 from acquisitions was offset by declines in revenues from existing businesses of approximately 20 driven by recessionrelated weakness in end markets particularly semiconductor end markets electronic test revenues declined 15 acquisition growth of 35 and continued growth in sales of fluke networks business were offset by declines in sales of fluke industrial products environmental revenues for 2001 increased 17 from 2000 7 of this growth resulted from acquisitions with the balance coming from core growth in the veederroot and water quality product lines the company’s aerospace and defense business units grew 39 in 2001 acquisition growth of 30 in particular that provided by the fullyear impact of the kollmorgen acquisition accounted for most of the increase power quality revenues declined 14 in 2001 as net acquisition growth of 6 offset significant declines in enduser demand 

  

operating profit margins excluding the effects of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 increased from 157 to 165 due to aggressive cost reduction actions across all business units and continued margin improvements in recently acquired companies 

  

tools and components 

  

the tools and components segment is comprised of the danaher hand tool group including the special markets asian tools professional tools and matco tools divisions jacobs chuck manufacturing company delta consolidated industries jacobs vehicle systems hennessy industries and the hardware and electrical apparatus lines of joslyn manufacturing company this segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics’ hand tools other products manufactured by these companies include toolboxes and storage devices diesel engine retarders wheel service equipment drill chucks customdesigned headed tools and components hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries and highquality precision socket screws fasteners and miniature precision parts 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

revenues in the tools and components segment grew 2 in 2002 the entirety of this growth represents core sales volume growth as there were no acquisitions in this segment during 2001 and 2002 and price and currency impacts were negligible hand tool revenues representing approximately 65 of segment sales grew 2 generated primarily by increases in the matco sales channel as a result of continued market share gains additionally hand tool revenues in the company’s asian channels grew but were offset by declines in domestic retail channels sales of diesel engine retarders at the jacobs vehicle systems business unit increased significantly as oem customers accelerated their 2002 order rates to meet a regulatory deadline diesel engine retarder demand declined sharply following passage of the regulatory deadline in october 2002 and is expected to negatively impact engine retarder revenues during 2003 increases in this segment in 2002 were offset by declines in the delta and jacobs chuck business units 

  

operating profit margins for the segment were 152 in 2002 compared to 113 in 2001 excluding the impact of the 2001 restructuring program from both 2002 and 2001 margins increased 16 points from 135 in 2001 to 151 in 2002 this increase resulted from the effect of higher revenue levels the cessation of goodwill amortization as of january 1 2002 and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions 

  

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

sales declined 13 from 2000 to 2001 continued weakness in the heavyduty truck market significantly impacted sales of diesel engine retarders accounting for a 4 drop in segment revenues sharp declines in drill chuck sales combined with a fall in hand tool revenues to contribute a 6 reduction in segment sales from 2000 sales in both the joslyn hardware and electrical apparatus lines and the delta industries product lines reflected doubledigit declines from the sales levels achieved by those lines in 2000 due to recessionary pressures in the markets they serve price and currency impacts were negligible for this segment operating profit margins excluding the effects of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 decreased from 142 to 135 the unfavorable impact of lower production volumes was partially offset by aggressive cost reduction actions taken across all business units 

  

gross profit 

  

gross profit margin for 2002 was 390 an increase of 08 points compared to 382 in 2001 this increase resulted from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program and other improvements in the gross margins of core business units in addition to the effect of slightly higher gross margins of newly acquired businesses 

  

gross profit margin in 2001 was 382 a 05 decrease compared to 387 achieved in 2000 lower core volume and lower margins associated with businesses acquired in 2000 and 2001 drove the reduction and were partially offset by overhead cost reductions and process improvements in all business units 

  

operating expenses 

  

in 2002 selling general and administrative expenses were 238 of sales an increase of 07 points from 2001 levels this increase is due primarily to the effect of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative cost structures offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization effective january 1 2002 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for 2001 as a percentage of sales were 231 1 point lower than in 2000 aggressive cost reductions and reductions in discretionary spending implemented in late 2000 and throughout 2001 drove this decrease 

  

restructuring charge 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company recorded a restructuring charge of 697 million 435 million after tax or 029 per share during the fourth quarter of 2001 management determined that it would restructure certain of its product lines principally its drill chuck power quality and industrial controls divisions to improve financial performance the primary objective of the restructuring plan was to reduce operating costs by consolidating eliminating andor downsizing existing operating locations no significant product lines have been discontinued severance costs for the termination of approximately 1100 employees was estimated at 49 million these employees include all classes of employees including hourly direct indirect salaried and management personnel at the affected facilities approximately 16 million of the charge was to provide for impaired assets associated with the closure of 16 manufacturing and distribution facilities in north america and europe the assets impaired were principally equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the facilities to be closed the remainder of the charge was for other exit costs including lease termination costs approximately 255 million of the 697 million charge related to the tools and components segments and approximately 442 million of the charge related to the processenvironmental controls segment a table describing the application of the restructuring accrual is included in note 3 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

the expected annual pretax cost reduction net of increased costs at other facilities from the restructuring is approximately 38 million of which approximately 50 has been realized in 2002 with the full year benefit to be realized in 2003 these net cost reductions will primarily reduce the cost of goods sold in the company’s consolidated statement of earnings as of december 31 2002 the restructuring program has been substantially completed as planned while certain estimates are required in determining the net amount of cost savings achieved based on the company’s analysis of the impact of the restructuring management believes these net costs savings have been realized 

  

due to minor changes to the original restructuring plan and to costs incurred being less than estimated in december 2002 the company adjusted its restructuring reserves accrued as part of the fourth quarter 2001 restructuring charge by approximately 63 million 41 million after tax or 003 per share 

  

in conjunction with the closing of the facilities approximately 4 million of inventory was written off in the fourth quarter of 2001 as unusable in future operating locations this inventory consisted principally of component parts and raw materials which were either redundant to inventory at the 

  

facilities being merged andor were not economically feasible to relocate since the inventory was purchased to operate on equipment and tooling which was not being relocated the inventory writeoff was included in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 and was not part of the restructuring charge 

  

interest costs and financing transactions 

  

the company’s debt financing as of december 31 2002 was composed primarily of 542 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 “lyons” 315 million of 625 eurobond notes due 2005 and 250 million of 6 notes due 2008 the company maintains uncommitted lines and a revolving 500 million senior unsecured credit facility available for general corporate purposes there have been no borrowings under the revolving credit facility since it was established in june 2001 borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest of eurocurrency rate plus 21 to 70 depending on the company’s current debt rating the credit facility has a fixed five year term there were no borrowings outstanding under the company’s uncommitted lines of credit as of december 31 2002 

  

net interest expense of 437 million in 2002 was 179 million higher than 2001 returns on invested cash balances fell significantly as general shortterm market interest rates declined substantially throughout 2002 interest income of 103 million and 224 million was recognized in 2002 and 2001 respectively net interest expense in 2001 was 35 million lower than in 2000 due to an increase in interest earned as a result of higher average invested cash balances during 2001 

  

income taxes 

  

the 2002 effective tax rate of 340 is 35 lower than the 2001 effective rate mainly due to the effect of adopting sfas no 142 and its resulting cessation of goodwill amortization and also due to a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2002 compared to 2001 

  

in connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit the company adjusted certain income tax related reserves established related to the sale of a previously discontinued operation and recorded a 30 million credit to its fourth quarter 2002 income statement this credit has been classified separately below net earnings from continuing operations since the tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation 

  

the 2001 effective tax rate of 375 is 05 lower than in 2000 driven primarily by a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2001 compared to 2000 

  

inflation 

  

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations has been minimal in 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities 

  

the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates the value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basispoint increase in interest rates at december 31 2002 the market value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt would decrease by 15 million this methodology has certain limitations and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the company’s results of operations or financial conditions under current accounting principles in january 2002 the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the 6 notes due 2008 having a notional principal amount of 100 million whereby the effective interest rate on 100 million of these notes will be the six month libor rate plus approximately 0425 in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended the company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges since these instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges they will have no impact on net income or stockholders’ equity see note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than 30 countries as a result it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services the company’s issuance of eurobond notes in 2000 provides an offset to a portion of the company’s european net asset position the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 

  

  

other than the above noted swap arrangements there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented additionally the company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives 

  

liquidity and capital resources

accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates these estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income taxes and contingencies and litigation the company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 in our consolidated financial statements 

  

accounts receivable  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

inventory  the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

  

acquired intangibles  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 the new accounting standard for goodwill which requires that the company on an annual basis calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units 

  

longlived assets  the company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of longlived assets including property plant and equipment relying on a number of factors including operating results budgets economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 

  

purchase accounting  in connection with its acquisitions the company assesses and formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity this process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition the company accrues estimates for certain costs related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings anticipated at the date of acquisition in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 953 “recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination” adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized to the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances costs incurred in excess of the recorded accruals are expensed as incurred 

  

new accounting standards 

  

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “business combinations” this statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill the company has followed the requirements of this statement for business acquisitions made after june 30 2001 see note 2 of the consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” this statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life the statement requires a test for impairment to be performed annually or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment measured on a reporting unit basis could exist the company adopted the statement effective january 1 2002 danaher has nine reporting units closely aligned with the company’s strategic platforms and specialty 

  

niche businesses they are as follows tools motion electronic test power quality environmental aerospace and defense industrial controls levelflow and product identification 

  

as a result of adopting sfas no 142 the company will no longer record goodwill amortization which amounted to approximately 55 million and 46 million net of tax in 2001 and 2000 respectively using the fair value measurement requirement rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach the company recorded an impairment related to the company’s power quality business unit of 200 million 1738 million after tax approximately 87 of intangible assets recorded as of january 1 2002 

  

the following table provides the comparable effects of adopting of sfas no 142 for the two years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 

  

for the years ended december 31 

  

   

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” sfas no 143 addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 the company does not believe that implementation of this sfas will have a material impact on its financial statements 

  

in october 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which supersedes sfas no 121 though it retains the basic requirements of sfas no 121 regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss sfas no 144 provides additional implementation guidance sfas no 144 applies to longlived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of including assets under capital leases of lessees assets subject to operating leases of lessors and prepaid assets sfas no 144 also expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary this statement was effective january 1 2002 implementation of this sfas did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

  

in april 2002 the fasb approved sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of sfas no 13 and technical corrections” sfas no 145 rescinds previous accounting guidance which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item under sfas no 145 classification of debt extinguishment depends on the facts and circumstances of the transaction sfas no 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after may 15 2002 the company does not expect this sfas to have a material impact on its financial statements 

  

in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” sfas no 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of the entity’s commitment to an exit plan this statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are 

  

initiated after december 31 2002 since adoption of this sfas is prospective the company does not believe that the implementation of this sfas will have a material impact on its financial statements 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued statement no 148 fas 148 “accounting for stockbased compensationtransition and disclosure” which amends fasb no 123 fas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” fas 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of fas 123 to require disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results the transition guidance and disclosure provisions of fas 148 will be effective for the company’s financial statements issued for the first quarter of 2003 as allowed by fas 123 the company follows the disclosure requirements of fas 123 but continues to account for its employee stock option plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” which results in no charge to earnings when options are issued at fair market value therefore at this time adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 requires a guarantor to make additional disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements regarding the guarantor’s obligations in additions fin 45 requires under certain circumstances that a guarantor recognize at the inception of the guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken when issuing the guarantee the company has adopted the disclosure requirements for the fiscal year ended december 31 2002 the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements
