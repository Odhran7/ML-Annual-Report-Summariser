competition 

the company’s staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates the staffing business is highly competitive with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the company on a national regional or local basis in many areas the local companies are the strongest competitors the most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel the expanded acceptance of remote work creates significant opportunity for the company it brings together the company’s numerous strengths including its global brand global office network global candidate database and advanced aidriven technologies and data analytics at the scale needed to excel at outofmarket recruitment and placements this strengthens the company’s competitive position significantly since its traditionally toughest competitors local and regional staffing firms generally do not have these capabilities 

protiviti faces competition in its efforts to attract clients expand relationships with existing clients and win new business proposals the global professional services business is highly competitive with a dynamic regulatory environment disruptive new technologies security and privacy concerns and high demand for skilled professionals all driving significant opportunities the principal competitors of protiviti remain the “big four” accounting firms and other consultancies significant competitive factors include reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel protiviti believes its competitive strengths lie in the collaborative approach it takes to working with clients which drives knowledge transfer understanding of client issues and value creation this may be coupled with a “configuretofit” resourcing model to create blended teams of fulltime protiviti professionals and engagement professionals from robert half’s network of specialized talent to precisely match expertise approach and people to the changing global needs of clients on consulting and managed solutions projects

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

risks related to the company’s business environment 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the company’s business and financial condition the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients in the recent past certain of the company’s markets experienced economic uncertainty characterized by increasing unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending in addition certain geopolitical events including the spread of covid19 and the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” have caused significant economic market political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the company’s markets any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits further continued or intensifying economic political or regulatory uncertainty in the company’s markets could reduce demand for the company’s services 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants the company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign 

countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease the value of the us dollar has recently weakened against a number of major foreign currencies but an increase in strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets when translated into us dollars to decline 

significant uk or european developments stemming from the uk’s decision to withdraw from the european union could have a material adverse effect on the company in the past several years the european market experienced economic uncertainty which adversely affected and the return of which may in the future adversely affect the company’s operations in europe in particular brexit has contributed to and may continue to contribute to european economic market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect european or worldwide economic market regulatory or political conditions to the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in europe related to brexit or otherwise worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations 

the currently evolving situation of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease  “ covid19 ” has impacted demand for the company’s services disrupted the company’s operations and may continue to do so the covid19 outbreak emerged as a serious threat to the health and economic wellbeing of the company’s clients candidates employees and the overall economy at various times during the outbreak many counties states and countries took dramatic action including without limitation ordering all nonessential workers to stay home mandating the closure of schools and nonessential business premises and imposing isolation measures on large portions of the population these measures while intended to protect human life had serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies and may do so in the future if they are continued or reintroduced 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and volatility in the company’s business initially it caused a dramatic increase in unemployment in the united states and in certain other regions in which the company operates and mandated business closures and slowing economic activity reduced the use of temporary workers and reduced businesses’ recruitment of new employees resulting in less demand for the company’s services during 2021 however demand for workers and the company’s services increased significantly as economic activity recovered worksites reopened and many business sought to restore or expand workforces that had shrunk during the course of the pandemic there can be no assurance however that this increased demand for workers and the company’s services will be sustained furthermore the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus or of other illnesses may cause a rapid deterioration of economic conditions and the financial and credit markets which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the company has transitioned a significant number of the company’s employee population to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid19 this transition to remote working and the spread of covid19 may negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct the company’s business and the business and operations of the company’s thirdparty service providers who perform critical services for the company’s business this transition to remote working has also increased the company’s vulnerability to risks related to the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems and exacerbated certain related risks including risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks 

the company is continuing to monitor the spread of covid19 including the emerging variants of the disease and related risks including risks related to efforts to mitigate the disease’s spread the rapid development and fluidity of the situation however precludes any prediction as to its ultimate impact on us the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus or of other illnesses may adversely impact global economies and financial markets resulting in an economic downturn that would likely impact demand for the company’s services while the company has navigated the covid19 pandemic thus far its continuation or worsening may have a negative impact on the company’s business 

any of the above factors or other cascading effects of the covid19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase the company’s costs severely negatively impact the company’s revenue net income and other results of operations and impact the company’s liquidity position the duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted and such impacts may also have the effect of heightening many of the other material risks the company faces 

natural disasters and unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect the companys business and financial condition with operations in many states and multiple foreign countries the company is subject to numerous risks outside of the companys control including risks arising from natural disasters such as fires earthquakes hurricanes floods tornadoes unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic and other global health emergencies terrorist acts or disruptive global political events or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect the 

companys business and financial performance historically the company’s operations are heavily dependent on the ability of employees and consultants to travel from business to business and from location to location any public health emergencies including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu sars ebola coronavirus or even a particularly virulent flu could decrease demand for the companys services and the companys ability to offer them uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change and can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open which could lead to decreased ability to offer the companys services and materially adversely affect the companys shortterm results of operations in addition these events could result in delays in placing employees and consultants the temporary disruption in the transport of employees and consultants overseas and domestically the inability of employees and consultants to reach or have transportation to clients directly affected by such events and disruption to the companys information systems although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could materially adversely affect the companys reputation business and financial condition 

risks related to the company’s operations 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors before the covid19 pandemic unemployment in the united states was at historic lows and during the second half of 2021 as the economy recovered competition for workers in a number of industries became intense when unemployment levels are low finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands is more challenging at various times during the pandemic this challenge has been exacerbated by the withdrawal of some workers from the labor pool whether due to health concerns school and daycare closures or other reasons any resurgence of covid19 may adversely impact the companys ability to recruit sufficient candidates for certain industries or regions in which the company operates any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information furthermore as the employer of record for some individuals who have been placed in client workplaces where exposure to covid19 is possible the company may be subject to risk of liability should such employees allege their workplaces failed to adequately mitigate the risk of exposure to covid19 in addition in order to facilitate remote working arrangements some of the company’s temporary workers are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloudbased systems which could increase cybersecurity risks to the company’s clients for which they may hold the company liable while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information in some cases the company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of 

its clients the company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients technological advances such as artificial intelligence machine learning and automation are impacting industries served by all the companys lines of business in addition the company’s business relies on a variety of technologies including those that support hiring and tracking order management billing and client data analytics if the company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments appropriately implement new technologies or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments the company’s services results of operations and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected 

the demand for the company’s services related to regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley antimoney laundering act of 2020 reviews aml and other regulatory compliance services there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services for example the jumpstart our business startup “jobs” act signed into law in april of 2012 allows most companies going public in the us to defer implementation of some of the provisions of sarbanesoxley for up to five years after their initial public offering similarly a number of proposals have been recently or are currently being considered by the us congress to further delay or in some cases remove the requirements of sarbanesoxley for a number of public companies these or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for protiviti’s services 

demand for the company’s services from government and public sector clients related to the covid19 pandemic may decrease over time the company has reported increased business from services rendered to the public sector during the pandemic due to among other developments the volume of unemployment claims and housing assistance claims as well as the demands faced by public school districts that must meet the technical support requirements of virtual learning models additional business with public sector clients not directly related to the covid19 pandemic has been reported in 2021 the pandemicrelated services and other work for public sector clients has contributed to the companys revenue over the past year it is unknown to what extent business with state local and other public sector clients may decrease as the effects of the pandemic lessen or change over time demand for the company’s services from government and public sector clients may also fall as clients adapt to the effects of the pandemic and their needs evolve the company will continue to monitor the situation but the future impact of the pandemic and its effects on the needs of the company’s clients are impossible to fully predict and there can be no assurance that the company’s increased business in the public sector will be sustained 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results additionally the company’s clients will frequently enter nonexclusive arrangements with several firms which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty the nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting the companys future results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified skilled personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology personnel and other requirements to successfully compete 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

government imposed vaccine mandates could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations  in september 2021 president biden announced two executive orders related to vaccine mandates that would impact the companys operations in the united states the first executive order the osha vaccination and testing emergency temporary standard “ets” — was blocked by a stay of enforcement by the united states supreme court on january 13 2022 on january 25 2022 the department of labor withdrew the ets however osha could still pursue a vaccine mandate through the regular federal rulemaking process a second executive order on ensuring adequate covid19 safety protocols for federal contractors “eo 14042” would apply to the company as a federal contractor and subcontractor eo 14042 is also subject to legal challenges and is currently subject to a nationwide injunction during the pendency of federal court proceedings at this time it is unclear among other things if or when any federal vaccine mandates may go into effect further state and local governments in the united states and in international jurisdictions where we operate may implement vaccine mandates currently new york city has a mandate and it is not clear if such mandates will go into effect or stay in effect whether any will apply to all employees or only to employees who work in the office and how compliance will be documented should such mandates apply to us we may be required to implement a requirement that all of our employees get vaccinated subject to limited exceptions at this time protiviti has implemented a vaccine requirement for its operations however the company’s staffing operations do not have a vaccine requirement currently it is not possible to predict the impact that a federal vaccine mandate any other vaccine mandate or a vaccine requirement should we elect to adopt one will have on us or on our workforce any vaccine requirement or vaccine mandate if implemented may result in employee attrition however any failure to implement a vaccine requirement or mandate may also result in employee attrition or resistance to returning to onsite work either of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the company’s future earnings in many jurisdictions in which the company operates the employment services industry is heavily regulated for example governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the company’s employees may be used in other countries special taxes fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees additionally trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions 

the countries in which we operate may among other things 

• create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the company currently provides 

• require new or additional benefits be paid to the company’s employees 

• require the company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services or 

• increase taxes such as sales or valueadded taxes payable by the providers of temporary workers 

any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the company to continue to provide employment services additionally as the company expands existing service offerings adds new service offerings or enters new markets it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business increase costs and impact profitability 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the us and in certain foreign 

countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company further changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the company’s operations in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins further lawsuits or other proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company for example the company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the fair credit reporting act it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation however such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings an unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

if the company fails to comply with antibribery laws or economic sanction regulations it could be subject to substantial fines or other penalties  in many parts of the world including countries in which the company operates andor seeks to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations “antibribery laws” these laws generally prohibit companies their employees and thirdparty intermediaries from authorizing promising offering providing soliciting or accepting directly or indirectly improper payments or benefits to or from any person whether in the public or private sector in addition the fcpa’s accounting provisions require the company to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls any violation of the fcpa or other applicable antibribery laws could result in substantial fines sanctions or civil andor criminal penalties debarment from business dealings with certain governments or government agencies or restrictions on the marketing of the company’s products in certain countries which could harm the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

additionally the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and other relevant agencies of the us government administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons from conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries or with governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions similar economic sanctions are imposed by the european union and other jurisdictions the company’s international operations subject it to these laws and regulations which are complex restrict the company’s business dealings with certain countries governments entities and individuals and are constantly changing penalties for noncompliance with these complex laws and regulations can be significant and include substantial fines sanctions or civil andor criminal penalties and violations can result in adverse publicity which could harm the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

although the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws economic sanctions and other laws and regulations the company cannot be sure that its employees agents or other third parties will not violate such policies or applicable laws and regulations any such violations could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against the company its officers or its employees prohibitions on the conduct of its business and materially damage the company’s reputation brand business and operating results further detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of the company’s senior management 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states in 2015 the company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the ppaca’s employer mandate 

the us congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the ppaca and in 2020 the united states supreme court heard an appeal of a decision from the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit that invalidated significant portions of the ppaca it is unclear at this point what the scope of any such future legislation will be and when it will become effective because of the uncertainty surrounding proposed replacement health care reform legislation or any modifications to such legislation to deal with these court challenges the company cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the ppaca’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the company’s financial condition or operating results 

whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the us there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the company’s health care expenditures may increase 

risks related to the company’s information technology cybersecurity and data protection 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems some of which are managed by thirdparty vendors the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees and those of the company’s vendors 

the company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems the misuse of which could result in legal liability cyberattacks including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the company in particular may disable or damage its systems it is possible that the company’s security controls or those of its thirdparty vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information such disclosure or damage to the company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the company introduces new service offerings 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations in the ordinary course of business the company collects uses and retains personal information from its employees employment candidates and contractors including without limitation full names governmentissued identification numbers addresses birthdates and payrollrelated information the possession and use of personal information in conducting the company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy protection and security which in many cases apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information such as strong safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the european union and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer residency privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention while any failure by the company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions fines and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and reputation 

risks related to the company’s internal controls and accounting policies 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the companys business although the company has processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner the companys efforts may not be sufficient 

the collective impact of the tone at the top tone in the middle and tone at the bottom on risk management compliance and responsible business behavior has a huge effect on timely escalation of risk issues particularly those affecting core operations the company’s processes corporate culture and general ethical climate may not be sufficient to ensure timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues 

general risk factors 

us federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the company on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was signed into law notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall impact of these changes on the company’s results of operations will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the tcja are implemented in addition various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the tcja which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the company’s results of operations

executive overview 

the company achieved record levels of service revenues and net income during 2021 due to a broadbased global acceleration in demand for its staffing and business consulting services annual service revenues reached 646 billion in 2021 increasing 265 from the prior year fullyear 2021 net income increased 955 to 599 million and diluted net income per share increased 985 to 536 

the future of work increasingly includes flexible hybrid and fully remote models and the company can deliver deeper skills and more pricepoint choices to its clients by expanding candidate searches beyond local markets while leveraging its global office network and advanced aidriven technologies the expanded acceptance of remote work creates significant opportunity for the company it brings together the companys numerous strengths including its global brand global office network global candidate database and advanced aidriven technologies and data analytics at the scale needed to excel at outofmarket recruitment and placements this strengthens the companys competitive position significantly since its traditionally toughest competitors local and regional staffing firms generally do not have these capabilities 

protiviti continues to be a strong differentiator for the company with multiple years of consecutive growth and a highly diversified client base and suite of solution offerings growth remains strong across internal audit technology consulting risk and compliance consulting and business performance improvement technology consulting is the largest solution group with particular strength in cybersecurity and privacy solutions as well as enterprise applications and data analytics the company continues to see positive results in the collaboration between protiviti and staffing which pairs protivitis worldclass consulting talent with staffings deep operational resources to provide a costeffective solution to clients skills and scalability needs protiviti has also benefited from project work in the public sector resulting from various governmental stimulus programs 

demand for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor trends both domestically and abroad the united states economic backdrop during 2021 was conducive to growth for the company as real gross domestic product “gdp” increased 57 in 2021 compared to a decrease of 35 in 2020 while the unemployment rate declined from 67 in december 2020 to 39 in december 2021 in the united states the number of job openings exceeded the number of hires at the end of december 2021 creating competition for skilled talent that increases the companys value to clients the us labor market remains robust with significant demand due to talent shortages across professional disciplines 

we monitor various economic indicators and business trends in all of the countries in which we operate to anticipate demand for the company’s services we evaluate these trends to determine the appropriate level of investment including personnel which will best position the company for success in the current and future global macroeconomic environment the company’s investments in headcount are typically structured to proactively support and align with expected revenue growth trends and productivity metrics we have limited visibility into future revenues not only due to the dependence on macroeconomic conditions noted above but also because of the relatively short duration of the company’s client engagements accordingly we typically assess headcount and other investments on at least a quarterly basis during 2021 the company increased headcount across all segments when compared to prior yearend levels 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

service revenues the company derives its revenues from three segments temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services revenues are recognized when promised goods or services are delivered to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services see note c—revenue recognition to the company’s consolidated financial statements included under part ii—item 8 of this report 

income taxes the company’s operations are subject to us federal state and local and foreign income taxes in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities and its provision for income taxes the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws that are applicable to its operations in various jurisdictions deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of its deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized valuation allowances of 242 million and 241 million were recorded as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the valuation allowances recorded relate primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the related valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note b—new accounting pronouncements to the company’s consolidated financial statements included under part ii—item 8 of this report 

results of operations 

the company analyzes its operating results for three reportable segments temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services the temporary and consultant staffing segment provides specialized staffing in the accounting and finance administrative and office information technology legal advertising marketing and web design fields the permanent placement staffing segment provides fulltime personnel in the accounting finance administrative and office and information technology fields the risk consulting and internal audit services segment provides internal audit technology consulting risk and compliance consulting and business performance improvement services 

demand for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends future demand for the company’s services cannot be forecast with certainty results for the full year 2021 show that the recovery from the recent economic downturn has surpassed prepandemic levels and continues with strong momentum and continued broadbased demand for the companys staffing and business consulting services the company will continue to invest in its people its technology its brands and its business model to strengthen the ability to connect people to meaningful and exciting new work and provide clients with the talent and deep subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete and grow 

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing business conducts placement activities through 321 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and 17 foreign countries while protiviti has 64 offices in 24 states and 12 foreign countries 

nongaap financial measures 

the financial results of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” and the rules of the sec to help readers understand the company’s financial performance the company supplements its gaap financial results with the following nongaap measures as adjusted revenue growth rates adjusted gross margin adjusted selling general and administrative expense segment income and combined segment income 

variations in the company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and billing days the company provides “as adjusted” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items these calculations show the yearoveryear revenue growth rates for the company’s lines of business on both a reported basis and also on an as adjusted basis for global us and international operations the company has provided this data because it focuses on the company’s revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time the company expresses yearoveryear revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates 

in order to calculate constant currency revenue growth rates as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period management then calculates a global weightedaverage number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all lines of business in order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days the company calculates same billing day revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount same billing day growth rates are then calculated based upon the per billing day amounts the term “as adjusted” means that the impact of different billing days and currency fluctuations are removed from the revenue growth rate calculation 

the following measures adjusted gross margin adjusted selling general and administrative expense and segment income include gains and losses on investments held to fund the company’s obligations under employee deferred compensation plans the company provides these measures because they are used by management to review its operational results 

combined segment income is income before income taxes adjusted for interest income net and amortization of intangible assets the company provides combined segment income because it is how management evaluates segment performance 

the nongaap financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the company’s industry as other companies may calculate such financial results differently the company’s nongaap financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to amounts presented in accordance with gaap the company does not consider these nongaap financial measures to be a substitute for or superior to the information provided by gaap financial results a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is provided on the following pages

years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

service revenues the company’s revenues were 646 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 increasing by 265 compared to 511 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 revenues from us operations increased 256 to 501 billion 775 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 398 billion 780 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 revenues from foreign operations increased 294 to 145 billion 225 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 112 billion 220 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 the economic recovery in the united states and abroad contributed to the increased broadbased demand for the company’s staffing and business consulting services contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail

gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing represent revenues less costs of services which consist of payroll payroll taxes and benefit costs for engagement professionals and reimbursable expenses the key drivers of gross margin are i paybill spreads which represent the differential between wages paid to engagement professionals and amounts billed to clients ii fringe costs which are primarily composed of payroll taxes and benefit costs and iii conversion revenues which are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position with the company’s client gross margin dollars for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were 160 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 up 218 from 131 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 as a percentage of revenues gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing were 396 in 2021 up from 378 in 2020 this yearoveryear improvement in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to higher paybill spreads and higher conversion revenues

liquidity and capital resources 

the change in the company’s liquidity during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures investment in employee deferred compensation trusts net of redemptions from employee deferred compensation trusts repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends 

cash and cash equivalents were 619 million and 574 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively operating activities provided 603 million during the year ended december 31 2021 offset by 88 million and 459 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities respectively operating and investing activities provided 597 million and 9 million respectively during the year ended december 31 2020 offset by 315 million of net cash used in financing activities 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 603 million this was composed of net income of 599 million adjusted upward for noncash items of 89 million offset by net cash used in changes in working capital of 85 million net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 597 million this was composed of net income of 306 million adjusted upward for noncash items of 59 million and net cash provided by changes in working capital of 232 million 

investing activities—cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 88 million this was composed of capital expenditures of 37 million and investments in employee deferred compensation trusts of 85 million offset by proceeds from employee deferred compensation trust redemptions of 34 million cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 9 million this was composed of proceeds from employee deferred compensation trust redemptions of 123 million largely offset by capital expenditures of 33 million investments in employee deferred compensation trusts of 65 million and 16 million cash paid for an acquisition 

capital expenditures including 31 million related to cloud computing implementations in 2021 totaled 68 million approximately 84 of which represented investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure both of which are important to the company’s sustainability and future growth opportunities capital expenditures for cloud computing arrangements are included in cash flows from operating activities on the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows capital expenditures included amounts spent on tenant improvements and furniture and equipment in the company’s leased offices we currently expect that 2022 capitalized expenditures will range from 95 million to 105 million of which 75 million to 80 million relates to software initiatives and technology infrastructure including capitalized costs relating to the implementation of cloud computing arrangements 

financing activities—cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 459 million this included repurchases of 288 million in common stock and 171 million in dividends paid to stockholders cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 315 million this included repurchases of 159 million in common stock and 156 million in dividends paid to stockholders

the company’s working capital as of december 31 2021 included 619 million in cash and cash equivalents and 985 million in accounts receivable both of which will be a significant source of ongoing liquidity and financial resilience the company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the company the company’s fixed payments dividends and other obligations on both a shortterm and longterm basis 

there is limited visibility into future cash flows as the company’s revenues are dependent on macroeconomic conditions the company’s variable direct costs related to its temporary and consultant staffing business will largely fluctuate in relation to its revenues

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company continues to monitor the global economic uncertainty as a result the covid19 pandemic to assess the impact on its results of operations financial condition and liquidity actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions 

because a portion of the company’s net revenues are derived from its operations outside the us and are denominated in local currencies the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company’s foreign subsidiaries exchange rates impact the us dollar value of the company’s reported revenues expenses earnings assets and liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 225 of the company’s revenues were generated outside of the united states these operations transact business in their functional currency which is the same as their local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly the canadian dollar british pound euro australian dollar and brazilian real have an impact on the company’s reported results under gaap revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period consequently as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of the company’s nonus markets the company’s reported results vary 

during 2021 the us dollar fluctuated and generally weakened against the primary currencies in which the company conducts business compared to one year ago currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing reported service revenues by 569 million or 11 in 2021 compared to the prior year the general weakening of the us dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the company’s foreign operations because substantially all the company’s foreign operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency the effect of higher reported revenues is largely offset by the increase in reported operating expenses reported net income was 34 million or 11 higher in 2021 compared to the prior year due to the effect of currency exchange rates 

for the one month ended january 31 2022 the us dollar has strengthened against the euro canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar and weakened against the brazilian real since december 31 2021 if currency exchange rates were to remain at january 2022 levels throughout 2022 the currency impact on the company’s fullyear reported revenues would be unfavorable offset by a favorable impact on operating expenses these results will likely have an immaterial impact on reported net income 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of the company’s stockholders’ equity the assets and liabilities of the company’s nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income although currency fluctuations impact the company’s reported results and shareholders’ equity such fluctuations generally do not affect cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses the company generally has few crossborder transfers of funds except for transfers to the us for payment of intercompany loans working capital loans made between the us and the company’s foreign subsidiaries and dividends from the company’s foreign subsidiaries

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

risks related to the company’s business environment 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the company’s business and financial condition the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients certain of the company’s markets have recently experienced economic uncertainty characterized by increasing unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending in addition certain geopolitical events including ongoing trade negotiations and the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” have caused significant economic market political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the company’s markets any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits further continued or intensifying economic political or regulatory uncertainty in the company’s markets could reduce demand for the company’s services 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results  as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants the company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease the value of the us dollar has recently weakened against a number of major foreign currencies but an increase in strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets when translated into us dollars to decline 

significant uk or european developments stemming from the uk’s decision to withdraw from the european union could have a material adverse effect on the company  in the past several years the european market experienced economic uncertainty which adversely affected and the return of which may in the future adversely affect the company’s operations in europe in particular brexit has contributed to and may continue to contribute to european economic market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect european or worldwide economic market regulatory or political conditions to the 

extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in europe related to brexit or otherwise worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations 

the currently evolving situation of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease covid19 has impacted demand for the company’s services disrupted the company’s operations and may continue to do so the covid19 outbreak has emerged as a serious threat to the health and economic wellbeing of the company’s clients candidates employees and the overall economy since the beginning of the outbreak many counties states and countries have taken dramatic action including without limitation ordering all nonessential workers to stay home mandating the closure of schools and nonessential business premises and imposing isolation measures on large portions of the population these measures while intended to protect human life have had serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies and the severity and the duration of these is highly uncertain the effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts including proposed government payments to affected citizens and industries continue to be uncertain and many economists are predicting extended local or global recessions the accelerating number of deaths and hospitalizations resulting from this disease are further exacerbating the uncertainties and challenges facing the company’s business 

actions intended to mitigate the spread of covid19 have caused a dramatic increase in unemployment in the united states and in certain other regions in which the company operates and created significant uncertainty and volatility in the company’s business mandated business closures and slowing economic activity have reduced use of temporary workers and reduced businesses’ recruitment of new employees resulting in less demand for the company’s services which may in the future materially harm the company’s business and financial condition many of the company’s clients have or may be required to or choose to voluntarily close their worksites and the company has at various times during the pandemic witnessed a significant drop in the demand of the company’s services by clients particularly the company’s recruiting and temporary staffing clients most of whom are small and midsize businesses that are feeling the crisis deterioration in economic conditions or the financial or credit markets could also have an adverse impact on the company’s clients’ ability to pay for services the company has already provided furthermore the spread of covid19 may adversely impact the company’s ability to recruit sufficient candidates for certain industries or regions in which the company operates 

the company has transitioned a significant number of the company’s corporate employee population to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid19 this transition to remote working and the spread of covid19 may negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct the company’s business and the business and operations of the company’s thirdparty service providers who perform critical services for the company’s business this transition to remote working has also increased the company’s vulnerability to risks related to the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems and exacerbated certain related risks including risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks 

the company is continuing to monitor the spread of covid19 including the new recently announced variants of the disease and related risks including risks related to efforts to mitigate the disease’s spread the rapid development and fluidity of the situation however precludes any prediction as to its ultimate impact on us if the spread and related business restrictions continue such impact could grow and the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected the continued spread and related business restrictions could also adversely impact global economies and financial markets resulting in an economic downturn that would likely impact demand for the company’s services while the company has navigated the covid19 pandemic thus far the ongoing surge of the covid19 pandemic in the united states the united kingdom and the european union among other territories will have a continued negative impact on the company’s business 

any of the above factors or other cascading effects of the covid19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase the company’s costs severely negatively impact the company’s revenue net income and other results of operations and impact the company’s liquidity position the duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted and such impacts may also have the effect of heightening many of the other material risks the company faces 

natural disasters and unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect the companys business and financial condition with operations in many states and multiple foreign countries the company is subject to numerous risks outside of the companys control including risks arising from natural disasters such as fires earthquakes hurricanes floods tornadoes unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic and other global health emergencies terrorist acts or disruptive global political events or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect the companys business and financial performance historically the company’s operations are heavily dependent on the ability of employees and consultants to travel from business to business and from location to location any public health emergencies including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu sars ebola coronavirus or even a 

particularly virulent flu could decrease demand for the companys services and the companys ability to offer them uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open which could lead to decreased ability to offer the companys services and materially adversely affect the companys shortterm results of operations in addition these events could result in delays in placing employees and consultants the temporary disruption in the transport of employees and consultants overseas and domestically the inability of employees and consultants to reach or have transportation to clients directly affected by such events and disruption to the companys information systems although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could materially adversely affect the companys reputation business and financial condition 

risks related to the company’s operations 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors before the covid19 pandemic unemployment in the united states was at historic lows when unemployment levels are low finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands is more challenging any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients  the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information furthermore as the employer of record for some individuals who have been placed in client workplaces where exposure to covid19 is possible the company may be subject to risk of liability should such employees allege their workplaces failed to adequately mitigate the risk of exposure to covid19 in addition in order to facilitate remote working arrangements some of the company’s temporary workers are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloudbased systems which could increase cybersecurity risks to the company’s clients for which they may hold the company liable while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information in many cases the company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business  the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of its client s the company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients technological advances such as artificial intelligence machine learning and automation are impacting industries served by all the companys lines of business in addition the company’s business relies on a variety of technologies including those that support hiring and tracking order management billing and client data analytics if the company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry 

developments appropriately implement new technologies or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments the company’s services results of operations and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline  the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services for example the jumpstart our business startup “jobs” act signed into law in april of 2012 allows most companies going public in the us to defer implementation of some of the provisions of sarbanesoxley for up to five years after their initial public offering similarly a number of proposals have been recently or are currently being considered by the us congress to further delay or in some cases remove the requirements of sarbanesoxley for a number of public companies these or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for protiviti’s services 

demand for the company’s services from government and public sector clients related to the covid19 pandemic may decrease over time the company has reported increased business from services rendered to the public sector during the pandemic due to among other developments the volume of unemployment claims and housing assistance claims as well as the demands faced by public school districts that must meet the technical support requirements of virtual learning models this business has contributed to our revenue over the past year it is unknown to what extent business with state local and other public sector clients may decrease as the effects of the pandemic lessen or change over time demand for the company’s services from government and public sector clients may also fall as clients adapt to the effects of the pandemic and their needs evolve the company will continue to monitor the situation but the future impact of the pandemic and its effects on the needs of the company’s clients are impossible to fully predict and there can be no assurance that the company’s increased business in the public sector will be sustained 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results additionally the company’s clients will frequently enter nonexclusive arrangements with several firms which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty the nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting the companys future results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified skilled personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology personnel and other requirements to successfully compete 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company 

legal and regulatory risks 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters as well as claims challenging the company’s compliance with the fair credit reporting act the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime 

compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions or to various other claims disputes and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations furthermore any future lawsuits claims disputes or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the company’s future earnings in many jurisdictions in which the company operates the employment services industry is heavily regulated for example governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the company’s employees may be used in other countries special taxes fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees additionally trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions 

the countries in which the company operates may among other things 

• create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the company currently provides 

• require new or additional benefits be paid to the company’s employees 

• require the company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services or 

• increase taxes such as sales or valueadded taxes payable by the providers of temporary workers 

any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the company to continue to provide employment services additionally as the company expands existing service offerings adds new service offerings or enters new markets it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business increase costs and impact profitability 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the us and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company further changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the company’s operations in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins further lawsuits or other proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company for example the company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the fair credit reporting act it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation however such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings an unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states in 2015 the company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the ppaca’s employer mandate 

the us congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the ppaca and in 2020 the united states supreme court heard an appeal of a decision from the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit that invalidated significant portions of the ppaca it is unclear at this point what the scope of any such future legislation will be and when it will become effective because of the uncertainty surrounding proposed replacement health care reform legislation or any modifications to such legislation to deal with these court challenges the company cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the ppaca’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the company’s financial condition or operating results whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the us there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the company’s health care expenditures may increase 

risks related to the company’s information technology cybersecurity and data protection 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems some of which are managed by thirdparty vendors the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees and those of the company’s vendors 

the company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems the misuse of which could result in legal liability cyberattacks including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the company in particular may disable or damage its systems it is possible that the company’s security controls or those of its thirdparty vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information such disclosure or damage to the company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the company introduces new service offerings 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations in the ordinary course of business the company collects uses and retains personal information from its employees employment candidates and contractors including without limitation full names governmentissued identification numbers addresses birthdates and payrollrelated information the possession and use of personal information in conducting the company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy protection and security which in many cases apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information such as strong safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the european union and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer residency privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention while any failure by the company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions fines and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and reputation 

risks related to the company’s internal controls and accounting policies 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the companys business although the company has processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner the companys efforts may not be sufficient 

the collective impact of the tone at the top tone in the middle and tone at the bottom on risk management compliance and responsible business behavior has a huge effect on timely escalation of risk issues particularly those affecting core operations  and the company’s processes corporate culture and general ethical climate may not be sufficient to ensure timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues 

general risk factors 

the company’s compliance policies and controls may not prevent violations that could result in significant fines and penalties the company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under us or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials including the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws that prohibit payments to foreign officials failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not only on the companys business in that market but also on the companys reputation generally although the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws it cannot be sure that its employees contractors or agents will not violate such policies any such violations could materially damage the company’s reputation brand business and operating results 

further changes in us laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers and any negative sentiments towards the united states as a result of such changes could adversely affect the company’s operations 

us federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the company on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was signed into law notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall impact of these changes on the company’s results of operations will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the tcja are implemented in addition various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the tcja which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the company’s results of operations

executive overview 

the company’s financial results during 2020 were affected by the economic crisis resulting from the covid19 pandemic primarily in the company’s staffing business annual service revenues reached 511 billion in 2020 a decrease of 159 from the prior year fullyear 2020 net income decreased to 306 million and diluted net income per share decreased to 270 both the temporary and consultant staffing segment and the permanent placement staffing segment experienced revenue declines while revenue in the risk consulting and internal audit services segment increased 118 in 2020 compared to last year 

demand for the company’s contract and consulting staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor trends both domestically and abroad although covid19 continues to impact the global economy the company has prioritized the health and safety of its employees and a majority of global staffing and protiviti employees continue working remotely the company has maintained full operations even where physical locations have remained closed we believe that the company is well positioned to participate fully as broader economic growth returns despite continued general economic declines there is still strong competition for skilled talent which increases the company’s value to clients 

the extent of the economic disruption on the company’s operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by the us government state and local government officials and international governments to prevent disease spread all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted 

given the magnitude of the covid19 impact on the company’s business we have worked to effectively manage our costs and pursue revenuegeneration opportunities 

protiviti continued its record of multiyear doubledigit revenue growth with particular strength in its technology consulting practice and it continues to benefit fro m multiple solutions offerings and pipeline including particularly robust growth from the blended solutions with the company’s temporary and consultant staffing operations 

the united states economic backdrop during 2020 was one of uncertainty as real gross domestic product “gdp” decreased 35 compared with an increase of 23 in 2019 the unemployment rate increased from 35 in december 2019 to a peak of 147 during april 2020 ending with 67 in december 2020 

we monitor various economic indicators and business trends in all of the countries in which we operate to anticipate demand for the company’s services we evaluate these trends to determine the appropriate level of investment including personnel which will best position the company for success in the current and future global macroeconomic environmen t the company’s investments in headcount are typically structured to proactively support and align with expected revenue growth trends and productivity metrics we have limited visibility into future revenues not only due to the dependence on macroeconomic conditions noted above but also because of the relatively short duration of the company’s client engagements accordingly we typically assess headcount and other investments on at least a quarterly basis as such during 2020 we decreased headcount in our staffing lines of business but increased headcount in the protiviti line of business when compar ed to prior yearend levels we are focused on the productivity levels of tenured staff and believe we have aligned staffing levels to drive increased profitability 

capital expenditures including 33 million related to cloud computing implementations in 2020 totaled 67 million approximately 71 of which represented investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure both of which are important to the company’s future growth opportunities capital expenditures for cloud computing implementation costs are included in cash flows from operating activities on the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows capital expenditures also included amounts spent on tenant improvements and furniture and equipment in the company’s leased offices we currently expect that 2021 capitalized expenditures will range from 85 million to 95 million of which 50 million to 60 million relates to software initiatives and technology infrastructure including capitalized costs relating to the implementation of cloud computing arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

service revenues the company derives its revenues from three segments temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services revenues are recognized when promised goods or services are delivered to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services see note c—“revenue recognition” to the company’s consolidated financial statements included under part ii—item 8 of this report 

income taxes the company’s operations are subject to us federal state and local and foreign income taxes in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities and its provision for income taxes the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws that are applicable to its operations in various jurisdictions deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of its deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized valuation allowances of 241 million and 216 million were recorded as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the valuation allowances recorded relate primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future segment income the company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the related valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company

part ii—item 8 of this report 

results of operations 

demand for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends future demand for the company’s services cannot be forecast 

with certainty the company’s investments in technology have allowed its internal staff to remain fully functional while working remotely during this pandemic while uncertainty remains in the overall economic environment we enter 2021 with renewed optimism about the company’s positioning for future growth we have retained our key staff and they are committed to driving our success as the backbone of our enterprise our technology investments have facilitated remote working models internally and with the companys advanced aidriven capabilities are providing clients with realtime choices of candidates from outside their local market area owing to its diversified solution offerings protiviti continues its record of multiyear doubledigit revenue growth the collaboration between protiviti and staffing is at an alltime high 

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing business conducts placement activities through 326 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and 17 foreign countries while protiviti has 62 offices in 23 states and 12 foreign countries 

the company has changed its consolidated statements of operations to separately present income loss from 

investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts under the company’s employee deferred compensation plans 

employees direct the investment of their account balances and the company invests amounts held in the associated investment 

trusts consistent with these directions as realized and unrealized investment gains and losses occur the company’s deferred 

compensation obligation to employees changes accordingly however the value of the related investment trust assets also 

changes by an equal and offsetting amount leaving no net cost to the company under the new presentation changes in the company’s employee deferred compensation obligations remain in selling general and administrative expenses or in the case of risk consulting and internal audit services costs of services however the offsetting changes in the investment trust assets will be presented separately below selling general and administrative expenses this does not change the previously reported levels of pretax or aftertax income or cash flow under the new presentation we replaced the discussion of consolidated operating income with the nongaap measure of combined segment income this is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for net interest income and amortization of intangible assets and is equal to the sum of segment income 

nongaap financial measures 

the financial results of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” and the rules of the sec to help readers understand the company’s financial performance the company supplements its gaap financial results with the following nongaap measures as adjusted revenue growth rates and combined segment income 

variations in the company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates billing days and certain intercompany adjustments the company provides “as adjusted” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items these calculations show the yearoveryear revenue growth rates for the company’s reportable segments on both a reported basis and also on an as adjusted basis for global us and international operations the company has provided this data because it focuses on the company’s revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time the company expresses yearoveryear revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates 

in order to calculate constant currency revenue growth rates as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign currency 

exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period management then calculates a global weightedaverage number of 

billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all lines of business in order to remove the 

fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days the company calculates same billing day revenue 

growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period 

to arrive at a per billing day amount same billing day growth rates are then calculated based upon the per billing day amounts 

the term “as adjusted” means that the impact of different billing days and constant currency fluctuations are removed from the 

revenue growth rate calculation 

combined segment income is defined as income before income taxes adjusted for net interest income and amortization of intangible assets and is equal to the sum of segment income the company provides combined segment income because it is 

how the company evaluates segment performance a reconciliation of combined segment income to reported income before 

income taxes is provided herein 

the nongaap financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the company’s industry as other companies may calculate such financial results differently the company’s nongaap financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with gaap the company does not consider these nongaap financial measures to be a substitute for or superior to the information provided by gaap financial results a reconciliation of the as adjusted revenue growth rates to the reported revenue growth rates is provided herein

years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

revenues the company’s revenues were 511 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 decreasing by 159 compared to 607 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 revenues from foreign operations represented 22 of total revenues for both the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services in 2020 revenues for the two staffing segments of the company were down whereas revenue was up for the companys risk consulting and internal audit segment when compared to 2019 the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 were adversely affected by the global stayathome orders significant travel restrictions and business closures which resulted in global economic disruptions revenue declines were experienced both domestically and internationally risk consulting and internal audit services continued to post strong growth rates contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail 

temporary and consultant staffing revenues were 348 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 decreasing by 212 compared to revenues of 441 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 key drivers of temporary and consultant staffing revenues include average hourly bill rates and the number of hours worked by the company’s engagement professionals on client engagements on an as adjusted basis temporary and consultant staffing revenues decreased 215 for 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to fewer hours worked by the company’s engagement professionals partially offset by a 64 increase in weighted average bill rates in the us 2020 revenues decreased 214 on an as reported basis and 217 on an as adjusted basis compared to 2019 for the company’s international operations 2020 revenues decreased 204 on an as reported basis and decreased 206 on an as adjusted basis compared to 2019 

permanent placement staffing revenues were 370 million for the year ended december 31 2020 decreasing by 306 compared to revenues of 533 million for the year ended december 31 2019 key drivers of permanent placement staffing revenues consist of the number of candidate placements and average fees earned per placement on an as adjusted basis permanent placement staffing revenues decreased 309 for 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by a decrease in number of placements in the us 2020 revenues decreased 317 on an as reported basis and 320 on an as adjusted basis compared to 2019 for the company’s international operations 2020 revenues decreased 281 on an as reported basis and decreased 283 on an as adjusted basis compared to 2019 historically demand for permanent placement services is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for temporary and consultant staffing and this is expected to continue 

risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were 126 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 increasing by 118 compared to revenues of 113 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 key drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services revenues are the billable hours worked by consultants on client engagements and average hourly bill rates on an as adjusted basis risk consulting and internal audit services revenues increased 110 for 2020 compared to 2019 driven primarily by an increase in billable hours in the us 2020 revenues increased 154 on an as reported basis or 149 on an as adjusted basis compared to 2019 for the company’s international operations 2020 revenues decreased 08 on an as reported basis or decreased 23 on an as adjusted basis compared to 2019 

a reconciliation of the nongaap yearoveryear revenue growth rates to the as reported yearoveryear revenue growth rates for the year ended december 31 2020 is presented in the following table 



gross margin  the company’s gross margin dollars were 201 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 down 203 from 253 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail 

gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing represent revenues less costs of services which consist of payroll payroll taxes and benefit costs for engagement professionals and reimbursable expenses the key drivers of gross margin are i paybill spreads which represent the differential between wages paid to engagement professionals and amounts billed to clients ii fringe costs which are primarily composed of payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary and consultant staffing employees and iii conversion revenues which are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position with the company’s client gross margin dollars for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were 131 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 down 217 from 168 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 as a percentage of revenues gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing were 378 in 2020 down from 380 in 2019 this yearoveryear decline in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower conversion revenues 

gross margin dollars for permanent placement staffing represent revenues less reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars for the company’s permanent placement staffing division were 369 million for the year ended december 31 2020 down 306 from 532 million for the year ended december 31 2019 because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing are de minimis gross margin dollars are substantially explained by the decline in revenues previously discussed 

gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less costs of services which consist primarily of professional staff payroll payroll taxes benefit costs and reimbursable expenses the primary drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin are i the relative composition of and number of professional staff and their respective pay and bill rates and ii staff utilization which is the relationship of time spent on client engagements in proportion to the total time available for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit services staff gross margin dollars for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit division were 330 million for the year ended december 31 2020 up 48 from 315 million for the year ended december 31 2019 impacting gross margin is employee deferred compensation expense related to changes in the fair value of participants’ accounts of 12 million and 6 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively equal and offsetting amounts are included in income from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts as a percentage of revenues gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services were 262 in 2020 down from 279 in 2019 the yearoveryear decline in gross margin percentage was due primarily to a decline in staff utilization 

selling general and administrative expenses  the company’s selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation advertising variable overhead depreciation and occupancy costs the company’s selling general and administrative expenses were 167 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 down 149 from 196 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 as a percentage of revenues the company’s selling general and administrative expenses were 326 in 2020 up slightly from 322 in 2019 contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail 

selling general and administrative expenses for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were 113 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 decreasing by 136 from 131 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 this includes employee deferred compensation expense related to changes in the fair value of participants’ accounts of 57 million and 44 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses for temporary and consultant staffing were 326 in 2020 up from 297 in 2019 due primarily to negative leverage as revenues decreased as a result of economic conditions during the year and an increase in employee deferred compensation expense related to changes in the fair value of participants’ accounts 

selling general and administrative expenses for the company’s permanent placement staffing division were 347 million for the year ended december 31 2020 decreasing by 236 from 454 million for the year ended december 31 2019 this includes employee deferred compensation expense related to changes in the fair value of participants’ accounts of 6 million and 5 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses for permanent placement staffing services were 937 in 2020 up from 851 in 2019 due primarily to negative leverage as revenues decreased as a result of economic conditions during the year 

selling general and administrative expenses for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division were 186 million for the year ended december 31 2020 decreasing by 34 from 193 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses for risk consulting and internal audit services were 148 in 2020 down from 171 in 2019 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to positive operating leverage resulting from increased revenue 

income from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts under the company’s employee deferred 

compensation plans employees direct the investment of their account balances and the company invests amounts held in the 

associated investment trusts consistent with these directions as realized and unrealized investment gains and losses occur the 

company’s employee deferred compensation obligation to employees changes accordingly changes in the company’s deferred 

compensation obligations noted above remain in selling general and administrative or in the case of the company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division costs of services the value of the related investment trust assets also changes by the equal and offsetting amount leaving no net costs to the company the company’s income from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts consists primarily of unrealized and realized gains and losses and dividend income from trust investments the company’s income from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts was 75 million and 55 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in income from trust investments was due to positive market returns in 2020 

income before income taxes and segment income the company’s total income before income taxes was 422 million or 83 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 down from 626 million or 103 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 combined segment income was 422 million or 83 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 down from 622 million or 102 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 

the following table provides a reconciliation of the reported income before income taxes to the nongaap combined segment income for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in thousands

liquidity and capital resources 

the change in the company’s liquidity during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures investment in employee deferred 

compensation trusts net of redemptions from employee deferred compensation trusts repurchases of common stock and 

payment of dividends 

cash and cash equivalents were 574 million and 270 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively operating activities provided 597 million during the year ended december 31 2020 in addition to 9 million generated from investing activities offset by 315 million of net cash used in financing activities operating activities provided 520 million during the year ended december 31 2019 offset by 102 million and 423 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities respectively

the company’s working capital at december 31 2020 included 574 million in cash and cash equivalents and 714 

million in accounts receivable both of which will be a significant source of ongoing liquidity and financial resilience the company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the company the company’s fixed payments dividends and other obligations on both a shortterm and longterm basis 

we have limited visibility into future cash flows as the company’s revenues are dependent on macroeconomic conditions as a result of continued economic disruptions we have continued to control costs during the year we have been focused on maintaining low travel and events costs as well as managing headcount this cost management coupled with a talented and driven team that is backed by our industryleading technology positions us to fully participate in the economic recovery in addition the company’s variable direct costs related to its temporary and consultant staffing business will largely fluctuate in relation to its revenues 

in may 2020 the company entered into a new 100 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “364day credit agreement” borrowings under the 364day credit agreement will bear interest in accordance with the terms of the borrowing which typically will be calculated according to the libor plus an applicable margin the 364day credit agreement is subject to certain financial covenants and the company was in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings under the 364day credit agreement as of december 31 2020

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in march 2020 the world health organization announced that covid19 had become pandemic the subsequent global stayathome orders resulted in significant travel restrictions and business closures these actions have led to global economic disruptions we are continuing to monitor the efforts to mitigate the spread of covid19 including uncertainty around the duration and extent of the stayathome orders and the effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity in light of the economic disruption we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply the company’s significant accounting policies as the situation continues to develop we may make changes to these estimates and judgments over time which could result in meaningful impacts to the company’s financial statements in future periods actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions 

because a portion of the company’s net revenues are derived from its operations outside the us and are denominated in 

local currencies the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company’s foreign subsidiaries exchange rates impact the us dollar value of the company’s reported revenues expenses earnings assets and liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 22 of the company’s revenues were generated outside of the united states these operations transact business in their functional currency which is the same as their local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly the canadian dollar british pound euro and australian dollar have an impact on the company’s reported results under gaap revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period consequently as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of the company’s nonus markets the company’s reported results vary 

during 2020 the us dollar fluctuated and strengthened against the canadian dollar and australian dollar but weakened against the british pound and euro compared to one year ago currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported service revenues by 16 million or less than 01 in 2020 compared to prior year the general fluctuation of the us dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the company’s foreign operations because substantially all of the company’s foreign operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency the effect of lower reported revenues is largely offset by the decrease in reported operating expenses reported net income was 09 million or 02 lower in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to prior year due to the effect of currency exchange rates 

for the one month ended january 31 2021 the us dollar has strengthened against the euro canadian dollar and australian dollar and weakened against the british pound since december 31 2020 if currency exchange rates were to remain at january 2021 levels throughout 2021 the currency impact on the company’s fullyear reported revenues and operating expenses would be nearly flat compared to full year 2020 results should current trends continue the impact on reported net income would be immaterial 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of the company’s stockholders’ equity the assets and liabilities of the company’s nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income although currency fluctuations impact the company’s reported results and shareholders’ equity such fluctuations generally do not affect cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses the company generally has few crossborder transfers of funds except for transfers to the us for payment of intercompany loans working capital loans made between the us and the company’s foreign subsidiaries and dividends from the company’s foreign subsidiaries

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

risks related to the company’s business environment 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the company’s business and financial condition the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients certain of the company’s markets have recently experienced economic uncertainty characterized by increasing unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending in addition certain geopolitical events including ongoing trade negotiations and the ongoing negotiation of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” have caused significant economic market political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the company’s markets any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits further continued or intensifying economic political or regulatory uncertainty in the company’s markets could reduce demand for the company’s services 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results  as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants the company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease the value of the us dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies and 

a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets when translated into us dollars to decline 

significant uk or european developments stemming from the uk’s decision to withdraw from the european union could have a material adverse effect on the company  in the past several years the european market experienced economic uncertainty which adversely affected and the return of which may in the future adversely affect the company’s operations in europe in particular brexit has contributed to and may continue to contribute to european economic market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect european or worldwide economic market regulatory or political conditions to the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in europe related to brexit or otherwise worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations 

natural disasters and unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect our business and financial condition with operations in many states and multiple foreign countries we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control including risks arising from natural disasters such as fires earthquakes hurricanes floods tornadoes unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks and other global health emergencies terrorist acts or disruptive global political events or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance for example the company’s operations are heavily dependent on the ability of employees and consultants to travel from business to business and from location to location any public health emergencies including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu sars ebola coronavirus or even a particularly virulent flu could decrease demand for our services and our ability to offer them uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open which could lead to decreased ability to offer our services and materially adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition these events could result in delays in placing employees and consultants the temporary disruption in the transport of employees and consultants overseas and domestically the inability of employees and consultants to reach or have transportation to clients directly affected by such events and disruption to our information systems although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could materially adversely affect our reputation business and financial condition 

risks related to the company’s operations 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors unemployment in the united states has been low in the past couple of years and has recently decreased further some economists have speculated that in certain markets the us could be at or near full employment this phenomenon has made finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands more challenging and further decreases in the employment rates could compound these difficulties any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients  the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information in many cases the company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having sufficient 

insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business  the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of its client s the company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients technological advances such as artificial intelligence machine learning and automation are impacting industries served by all our lines of business in addition the company’s business relies on a variety of technologies including those that support hiring and tracking order management billing and client data analytics if the company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments appropriately implement new technologies or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments the company’s services results of operations and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline  the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services for example the jumpstart our business startup “jobs” act signed into law in april of 2012 allows most companies going public in the us to defer implementation of some of the provisions of sarbanesoxley for up to five years after their initial public offering similarly there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the us congress to further delay or in some cases remove the requirements of sarbanesoxley for a number of public companies further many analysts are expecting the us congress and president trump to seek to repeal or modify legislation that is viewed as having overregulated certain sectors of the us economy and decreased the incentive for us companies to go public and their ability to effectively compete with foreign competition these or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for protiviti’s services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results additionally the company’s clients will frequently enter into nonexclusive arrangements with several firms which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty the nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting our future results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified skilled personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology personnel and other requirements to successfully compete 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company 

legal and regulatory risks 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters as well as claims challenging the company’s compliance with the fair credit reporting act the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions or to various other claims disputes and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations furthermore any future lawsuits claims disputes or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the company’s future earnings in many jurisdictions in which the company operates the employment services industry is heavily regulated for example governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the company’s employees may be used in other countries special taxes fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees additionally trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions 

the countries in which we operate may among other things 

• create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the company currently provides 

• require new or additional benefits be paid to the company’s employees 

• require the company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services or 

• increase taxes such as sales or valueadded taxes payable by the providers of temporary workers 

any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the company to continue to provide employment services additionally as the company expands existing service offerings adds new service offerings or enters new markets it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business increase costs and impact profitability 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the us and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company further changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the company’s operations in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins further lawsuits or other proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company for example the company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the fair credit reporting act it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation however such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts 

of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings an unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s compliance policies and controls may not prevent violations that could result in significant fines and penalties the company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under us or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials including the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws that prohibit payments to foreign officials failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally although the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws it cannot be sure that its employees contractors or agents will not violate such policies any such violations could materially damage the company’s reputation brand business and operating results 

further changes in us laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers and any negative sentiments towards the united states as a result of such changes could adversely affect the company’s operations 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states in 2015 the company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the ppaca’s employer mandate 

president trump and the us congress have and likely will continue to seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the ppaca the us congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the ppaca and in 2019 the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit invalidated significant portions of the ppaca in 2020 the us house of representatives petitioned the us supreme court to review the fifth circuit’s decision it is unclear at this point what the scope of any future such legislation will be and when it will become effective because of the uncertainty surrounding this replacement health care reform legislation we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the ppaca’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the company’s financial condition or operating results whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the us there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the company’s health care expenditures may increase 

us federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the company on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was signed into law notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall impact of these changes on the company’s results of operations will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the tcja are implemented in addition various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the tcja which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the company’s results of operations 

risks related to the company’s information technology cybersecurity and data protection 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems some of which are managed by thirdparty vendors the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees and those of the company’s vendors 

the company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems the misuse of which could result in legal liability cyberattacks including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the company in particular may disable or damage its systems it is possible that the company’s security controls or those of its thirdparty vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information such disclosure or damage to the company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the company introduces new service offerings 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations in the ordinary course of business the company collects uses and retains personal information from its employees employment candidates and contractors including without limitation full names governmentissued identification numbers addresses birth dates and payrollrelated information the possession and use of personal information in conducting the company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy protection and security which in many cases apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information such as strong safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the european union and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer residency privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention while any failure by the company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions fines and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and reputation 

risks related to the company’s internal controls and accounting policies 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business although we have processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner our efforts may not be sufficient 

the company’s culture may not sufficiently encourage timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues  the collective impact of the tone at the top tone in the middle and tone at the bottom on risk management compliance and responsible business behavior has a huge effect on timely escalation of risk issues particularly those affecting core operations

executive overview 

demand for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor trends both domestically and abroad annual service revenues reached 607 billion in 2019 an increase of 5 from the prior year fullyear 2019 net income increased to 454 million and diluted net income per share increased to 390 all three of the company’s reportable segments experienced revenue growth led by risk consulting and internal audit services which increased 18 in 2019 compared to last year 

we believe that the company is well positioned in the current macroeconomic environment the united states economic backdrop during 2019 was conducive to growth for the company as real gross domestic product “gdp” grew an estimated 23 while the unemployment rate declined from 39 in december 2018 to 35 in december 2019 in the united states the number of job openings has exceeded the number of hires since february 2015 creating competition for skilled talent that increases the company’s value to clients the us labor market remains robust with significant demand due to talent shortages across our professional disciplines where unemployment remains near a 50year low 

demand for protiviti’s services was broadbased across all of its consulting and internal audit solutions protiviti continues to nurture and grow a loyal client base 

we monitor various economic indicators and business trends in all of the countries in which we operate to anticipate demand for the company’s services we evaluate these trends to determine the appropriate level of investment including personnel which will best position the company for success in the current and future global macroeconomic environment the 

company’s investments in headcount are typically structured to proactively support and align with expected revenue growth trends as such during 2019 we added headcount in all of our lines of business compared to prior yearend levels 

we have limited visibility into future revenues not only due to the dependence on macroeconomic conditions noted above but also because of the relatively short duration of the company’s client engagements accordingly we typically assess headcount and other investments on at least a quarterly basis that said based on current trends and conditions we expect headcount levels for our fulltime staff to remain relatively flat for each of our reporting segments throughout the first quarter of 2020 

capital expenditures including 30 million related to cloud computing implementations in 2019 totaled 90 million approximately 62 of which represented investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure both of which are important to the company’s future growth opportunities capital expenditures for cloud computing implementation costs are included in cash flows from operating activities on the company’s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows capital expenditures also included amounts spent on tenant improvements and furniture and equipment in the company’s leased offices we currently expect that 2020 capitalized expenditures will range from 100 million to 110 million of which 50 million to 60 million relates to software initiatives and technology infrastructure including capitalized costs relating to the implementation of cloud computing arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

service revenues the company derives its revenues from three segments temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services revenues are recognized when promised goods or services are delivered to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services see note c—“revenue recognition” to the company’s consolidated financial statements included under part ii—item 8 of this report 

income taxes the company’s operations are subject to us federal state and local and foreign income taxes in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities and its provision for income taxes the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws that are applicable to its operations in various jurisdictions deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of its deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized valuation allowances of 216 million and 231 million were recorded as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the valuation allowances recorded relate primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the related valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note b—“new accounting pronouncements” to the company’s consolidated financial statements included under part ii—item 8 of this report 

results of operations 

demand for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends and the absence of material longterm contracts in any of the company’s business units future demand for the company’s services cannot be forecasted with certainty we believe the company is well positioned in the current macroeconomic environment 

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing business conducts placement activities through 326 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and 17 foreign countries while protiviti has 62 offices in 23 states and 11 foreign countries 

nongaap financial measures 

the financial results of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” and the rules of the sec to help readers understand the company’s financial performance the company supplements its gaap financial results with revenue growth rates derived from nongaap revenue amounts 

variations in the company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates billing days and certain intercompany adjustments the company provides “as adjusted” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items these calculations show the yearoveryear revenue growth rates for the company’s reportable segments on both a reported basis and also on an as adjusted basis for global us and international operations the company has provided this data because it focuses on the company’s revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time the company expresses yearoveryear revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days constant currency exchange rates and certain intercompany adjustments 

in order to calculate constant currency revenue growth rates as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period management then calculates a global weightedaverage number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all lines of business in order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days the company calculates same billing day revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount same billing day growth rates are then calculated based upon the per billing day amounts in order to remove the fluctuations caused by the impact of certain intercompany adjustments applicable comparative period revenues are reclassified to conform with the current period presentation the term “as adjusted” means that the impact of different billing days constant currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments are removed from the revenue growth rate calculation 

the nongaap financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the company’s industry as other companies may calculate such financial results differently the company’s nongaap financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with gaap the company does not consider these nongaap financial measures to be a substitute for or superior to the information provided by gaap financial results a reconciliation of the as adjusted revenue growth rates to the reported revenue growth rates is provided herein 

refer to item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

temporary and consultant staffing revenues were 441 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 increasing by 19 compared to revenues of 433 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 key drivers of temporary and consultant staffing revenues include average hourly bill rates and the number of hours worked by the company’s engagement professionals on client engagements on an as adjusted basis temporary and consultant staffing revenues increased 38 for 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a 52 increase in average bill rates partially offset by fewer hours worked by the company’s engagement professionals in the us 2019 revenues increased 39 on an as reported basis and 41 on an as adjusted basis compared to 2018 for the company’s international operations 2019 revenues decreased 48 on an as reported basis and increased 28 on an as adjusted basis compared to 2018 

permanent placement staffing revenues were 533 million for the year ended december 31 2019 increasing by 42 compared to revenues of 512 million for the year ended december 31 2018 key drivers of permanent placement staffing revenues consist of the number of candidate placements and average fees earned per placement on an as adjusted basis

a reconciliation of the nongaap yearoveryear revenue growth rates to the as reported yearoveryear revenue growth rates for the year ended december 31 2019 is presented in the following table 



gross margin  the company’s gross margin dollars were 253 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 up 50 from 241 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail 

gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing represent revenues less costs of services which consist of payroll payroll taxes and benefit costs for engagement professionals and reimbursable expenses the key drivers of gross margin are i paybill spreads which represent the differential between wages paid to engagement professionals and amounts billed to clients ii fringe costs which are primarily composed of payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary and consultant staffing employees and iii conversion revenues which are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position with the company’s client gross margin dollars for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were 168 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 up 29 from 163 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 as a percentage of revenues gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing were 380 in 2019 up from 376 in 2018 this yearoveryear improvement in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to higher paybill spreads 

gross margin dollars for permanent placement staffing represent revenues less reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars for the company’s permanent placement staffing division were 532 million for the year ended december 31 2019 up 42 from 511 million for the year ended december 31 2018 because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing services are de minimis the increase in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the increase in revenues previously discussed 

gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less costs of services which consist primarily of professional staff payroll payroll taxes benefit costs and reimbursable expenses the primary drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin are i the relative composition of and number of professional staff and their respective pay and bill rates and ii staff utilization which is the relationship of time spent on client engagements in proportion to the total time available for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit services staff gross margin dollars for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit division were 321 million for the year ended december 31 2019 up 190 from 269 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as a percentage of revenues gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services were 284 in 2019 up from 281 in 2018 the yearoveryear improvement in gross margin percentage was due primarily to improved staff utilization

selling general and administrative expenses for the company’s permanent placement staffing division were 449 million for the year ended december 31 2019 increasing by 67 from 420 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses for permanent placement staffing services were 841 in 2019 up from 821 in 2018 due primarily to negative leverage resulting from the company’s international operations 

selling general and administrative expenses for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division were 193 million for the year ended december 31 2019 increasing by 96 from 176 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses for risk consulting and internal audit services were 171 in 2019 down from 184 in 2018 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to positive operating leverage resulting from increased revenue 

operating income  the company’s total operating income was 622 million or 102 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 up 56 from 589 million or 102 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing division operating income was 410 million or 93 of applicable revenues up 13 from 405 million or 93 of applicable revenues in 2018 for the company’s permanent placement staffing division operating income was 84 million or 157 of applicable revenues down 76 from operating income of 91 million or 177 of applicable revenues in 2018 for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division operating income was 128 million or 113 of applicable revenues up 368 from operating income of 93 million or 97 of applicable revenues in 2018 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was 274 and 266 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the higher tax rate in 2019 is primarily due to an increase in permanent nondeductible expenses and a returntoprovision tax rate benefit from changes the company made in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act in 2018

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

because a portion of the company’s net revenues are derived from its operations outside the us and are denominated in 

local currencies the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company’s foreign subsidiaries exchange rates impact the us dollar value of the company’s reported revenues expenses earnings assets and liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2019 approximately 22 of the company’s revenues were generated outside of the united states these operations transact business in their functional currency which is the same as their local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly the canadian dollar british pound euro and australian dollar have an impact on the company’s reported results under gaap revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period consequently as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of the company’s nonus markets the company’s reported results vary 

during 2019 the us dollar fluctuated but generally strengthened against the primary currencies in which the company conducts business compared to one year ago currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported service revenues by 628 million or 11 in 2019 compared to prior year the general strengthening of the us dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the company’s foreign operations because substantially all of the company’s foreign operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency the effect of lower reported revenues is largely offset by the decrease in reported operating expenses reported net income was 25 million or 06 lower in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to prior year due to the effect of currency exchange rates 

for the one month ended january 31 2020 the us dollar has strengthened against the euro british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar since december 31 2019 if currency exchange rates were to remain at january 2020 levels throughout 2020 the company’s 2020 fullyear reported revenues would be impacted unfavorably mostly offset by a favorable impact to operating expenses thus the impact to reported net income would likely be immaterial 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of the company’s stockholders’ equity the assets and liabilities of the company’s nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income although currency fluctuations impact the company’s reported results and shareholders’ equity such fluctuations generally do not affect cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses the company generally has few crossborder transfers of funds except for transfers to the us for payment of intercompany loans working capital loans made between the us and the company’s foreign subsidiaries and dividends from the company’s foreign subsidiaries

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the   company’s business and financial condition the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients certain of the company’s markets have recently experienced prolonged economic downturns characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending in addition certain geopolitical events including the prolonged shutdown of the united states government and the ongoing negotiation of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” have caused significant economic market political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the company’s markets any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits further continued or intensifying economic political or regulatory uncertainty in the company’s markets could reduce demand for the company’s services 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants the company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters as well as claims challenging the company’s compliance with the fair credit reporting act the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions or to various other claims disputes and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations furthermore any future lawsuits claims disputes or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could 

cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets including europe for a significant portion of its business in the past several years the european market experienced economic uncertainty which adversely affected and the return of which may in the future adversely affect the company’s operations in europe in particular brexit has contributed to and may continue to contribute to european economic market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect european or worldwide economic market regulatory or political conditions to the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in europe related to brexit or otherwise worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations in addition these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease the value of the us dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies and a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets when translated into us dollars to decline 

the company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under us or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws it cannot be sure that its employees contractors or agents will not violate such policies any such violations could materially damage the company’s reputation brand business and operating results further changes in us laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers and any negative sentiments towards the united states as a result of such changes could adversely affect the company’s operations 

government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the company’s future earnings in many jurisdictions in which the company operates the employment services industry is heavily regulated for example governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the company’s employees may be used in other countries special taxes fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees additionally trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions 

the countries in which we operate may among other things 

 any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the company to continue to provide employment services additionally as the company expands existing service offerings adds new service offerings or enters new markets it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business increase costs and impact profitability 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors unemployment in the united states has been low in the past couple of years and has recently decreased further some economists have speculated that in certain markets the us could be at or near full employment this phenomenon has made finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands more challenging and further increases in the employment rates could compound these difficulties any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company operates in a highly competitive business   and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there 

are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information in many cases the company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the us and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company further changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the company’s operations in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins further lawsuits or other proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company for example the company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the fair credit reporting act it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation however such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings an unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states in 2015 the company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the ppaca’s employer mandate 

it is likely that president trump and the us congress will continue to seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the ppaca president trump has issued multiple executive orders in support of repealing the ppaca in whole or in part and the us congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the ppaca it is unclear at this point what the scope of any future such legislation will be and when it will become effective because of the uncertainty surrounding this replacement health care reform legislation we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the ppaca’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the company’s financial condition or operating results whether or 

not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the us there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the company’s health care expenditures may increase 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems some of which are managed by thirdparty vendors the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches phishing and malware attacks catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees and those of the company’s vendors the company has been subject to cyberattacks in the past including phishing and malware incidents and although no such attack has had a material adverse effect on its business this may not be the case with future attacks in particular the company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems the misuse of which could result in legal liability cyberattacks including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the company in particular may disable or damage its systems it is possible that the company’s security controls or those of its thirdparty vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information such disclosure or damage to the company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the company introduces new service offerings 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations in the ordinary course of business the company collects uses and retains personal information from its employees employment candidates and contractors including without limitation full names governmentissued identification numbers addresses birth dates and payrollrelated information the possession and use of personal information in conducting the company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy protection and security which in many cases apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information such as strong safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the european union and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer residency privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention while any failure by the company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions fines and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and reputation 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business although we have processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner our efforts may not be sufficient further the company’s culture may not sufficiently encourage timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues 

the company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of its clients the company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients technological advances such as artificial intelligence machine learning and automation are impacting industries served by all our lines of business in addition the company’s business relies on a variety of technologies including those that support hiring and tracking order management billing and client data analytics if the company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments appropriately implement new technologies or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such 

developments or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments the company’s services results of operations and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti  include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the us congress to further delay or in some cases remove the requirements of sarbanesoxley for a number of public companies further many analysts are expecting the us congress and president trump to seek to repeal or modify legislation that is viewed as having overregulated certain sectors of the us economy and decreased the incentive for us companies to go public and their ability to effectively compete with foreign competition these or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for protiviti’s services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results additionally the company’s clients will frequently enter into nonexclusive arrangements with several firms which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty the nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting our future results 

us federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the company on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was signed into law see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the tcja contains significant changes to corporate taxation including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 limitation for net operating losses to 80 of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated elimination of us tax on foreign earnings subject to certain important exceptions and modifying or repealing many business deductions including the ability to deduct executive compensation expenses in excess of 1 million in virtually all instances notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall impact of these changes on the company’s results of operations is uncertain and will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the tcja are implemented in addition various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the tcja which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the company’s results of operations 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti  is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified skilled personnel while protiviti  has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti  operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti  and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti  faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti  will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology personnel and other requirements to successfully compete 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti  consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti  for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti  or the company

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

because a portion of the company’s net revenues are derived from its operations outside the us and are denominated in 

local currencies the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company’s foreign subsidiaries exchange rates impact the us dollar value of the company’s reported revenues expenses earnings assets and liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 24  of the company’s revenues were generated outside of the united states these operations transact business in their functional currency which is the same as their local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly the canadian dollar british pound euro and australian dollar have an impact on the company’s reported results under gaap revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period consequently as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of the company’s nonus markets the company’s reported results vary 

during 2018  the us dollar fluctuated but generally weakened against the primary currencies in which the company conducts business compared to one year ago currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing reported net service revenues by 27 million or 05 in 2018  compared to prior year the general weakening of the us dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the company’s foreign operations because substantially all of the company’s foreign operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency the effect of higher reported revenues is largely offset by the increase in reported operating expenses reported net income was 25 million or 09 higher in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to prior year due to the effect of currency exchange rates 

for the month ended january 31 2019 the us dollar weakened against the euro british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar if currency exchange rates were to remain at january 2019  levels throughout 2019  the company’s 2019  fullyear reported revenues would be impacted favorably mostly offset by an unfavorable impact to operating expenses thus the impact to reported net income would likely be immaterial 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of the company’s stockholders’ equity the assets and liabilities of the company’s nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income although currency fluctuations impact the company’s reported results and shareholders’ equity such fluctuations generally do not affect cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses the company generally has few crossborder transfers of funds except for transfers to the us for payment of intercompany loans working capital loans made between the us and the company’s foreign subsidiaries and dividends from the company’s foreign subsidiaries

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

competition 

the company’s staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates the staffing business is highly competitive with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the company on a national regional or local basis in many areas the local companies are the strongest competitors the most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel the company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience with and commitment to the specialized employment market its national presence and its various marketing activities 

protiviti  faces competition in its efforts to attract clients and win proposal presentations the risk consulting and internal audit businesses are highly competitive in addition the changing regulatory environment is increasing opportunities for nonattestation audit and risk consulting services the principal competitors of protiviti  remain the “big four” accounting firms significant competitive factors include reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel protiviti  believes its competitive strengths lie in its unique ability to couple the deep skills and proven methodologies of its “big four” heritage with the customer focus and attention of a smaller organization

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the   company’s business and financial condition the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients certain of the company’s markets have recently experienced prolonged economic downturns characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending in addition certain geopolitical events including the ongoing negotiation of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” have caused significant economic market political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the company’s markets any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits further continued or intensifying economic political or regulatory uncertainty in the company’s markets could reduce demand for the company’s services 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants the company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters as well as claims challenging the company’s compliance with the fair credit reporting act the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions or to various other claims disputes and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur 

substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations furthermore any future lawsuits claims disputes or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets including europe for a significant portion of its business in the past several years the european market experienced economic uncertainty which adversely affected and the return of which may in the future adversely affect the company’s operations in europe in particular brexit has contributed to and may continue to contribute to european economic market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect european or worldwide economic market regulatory or political conditions to the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in europe related to brexit or otherwise worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations in addition these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease the value of the us dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies and a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets when translated into us dollars to decline 

the company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under us or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws it cannot be sure that its employees contractors or agents will not violate such policies any such violations could materially damage the company’s reputation brand business and operating results further changes in us laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers and any negative sentiments towards the united states as a result of such changes could adversely affect the company’s operations 

government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the company’s future earnings in many jurisdictions in which the company operates the employment services industry is heavily regulated for example governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the company’s employees may be used in other countries special taxes fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees additionally trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions 

the countries in which we operate may among other things 

 any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the company to continue to provide employment services additionally as the company expands existing service offerings adds new service offerings or enters new markets it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business increase costs and impact profitability 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors unemployment in the united states has been low in the past couple of years and has recently decreased further some economists have speculated that in certain markets the us could be at or near full employment this phenomenon has made finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ 

demands more challenging and further increases in the employment rates could compound these difficulties any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company operates in a highly competitive business   and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information in many cases the company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the us and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company further changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the company’s operations in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins further lawsuits or other proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company for example the company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the fair credit reporting act it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation however such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings an unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states in 2015 the company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the ppaca’s employer mandate 

it is likely that president trump and the us congress will continue to seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the ppaca president trump has issued multiple executive orders in support of repealing the ppaca 

in whole or in part and the us congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the ppaca it is unclear at this point what the scope of any future such legislation will be and when it will become effective because of the uncertainty surrounding this replacement health care reform legislation we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the ppaca’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the company’s financial condition or operating results whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the us there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the company’s health care expenditures may increase 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems some of which are managed by thirdparty vendors the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees and those of the company’s vendors in particular the company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems the misuse of which could result in legal liability cyberattacks including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the company in particular may disable or damage its systems it is possible that the company’s security controls or those of its thirdparty vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information such disclosure or damage to the company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the company introduces new service offerings 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations in the ordinary course of business the company collects uses and retains personal information from its employees employment candidates and contractors including without limitation full names governmentissued identification numbers addresses birth dates and payrollrelated information the possession and use of personal information in conducting the company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy protection and security which in many cases apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which becomes effective in may 2018 will impose more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information such as stronger safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the european union and stronger enforcement authorities and mechanisms complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer residency privacy and protection may increase the company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention while any failure by the company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions fines and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and reputation 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of its services the company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of its services the company’s business is reliant on a variety of technologies including those which support hiring and tracking order management billing and client data analytics if the company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments appropriately implement new technologies or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments the company’s services results of operations and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti  include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services for example the jumpstart our 

business startup “jobs” act signed into law in april of 2012 allows most companies going public in the us to defer implementation of some of the provisions of sarbanesoxley for up to five years after their initial public offering similarly there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the us congress to further delay or in some cases remove the requirements of sarbanesoxley for a number of public companies further many analysts are expecting the us congress and president trump to seek to repeal or modify legislation that is viewed as having overregulated certain sectors of the us economy and decreased the incentive for us companies to go public and their ability to effectively compete with foreign competition these or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for protiviti’s services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results additionally the company’s clients will frequently enter into nonexclusive arrangements with several firms which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty the nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting our future results 

us federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the company on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was signed into law the tcja resulted in a revaluation of the company’s estimated deferred income tax net assets and a resulting onetime noncash charge to its provision for income taxes in an amount of 34 million or 27 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in addition the tcja contains significant changes to corporate taxation including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 limitation for net operating losses to 80 of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated elimination of us tax on foreign earnings subject to certain important exceptions and modifying or repealing many business deductions including the ability to deduct executive compensation expenses in excess of 1 million in virtually all instances notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall impact of these changes on the company’s results of operations is uncertain and will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the tcja are implemented in addition various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the tcja which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the company’s results of operations 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti  is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified skilled personnel while protiviti  has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti  operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti  and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti  faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti  will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology personnel and other requirements to successfully compete 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti  consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti  for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti  or the company

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

because a portion of the company’s net revenues are derived from its operations outside the us and are denominated in 

local currencies the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company’s foreign subsidiaries exchange rates impact the us dollar value of the company’s reported revenues expenses earnings assets and liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 22  of the company’s revenues were generated outside of the united states these operations transact business in their functional currency which is the same as their local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly the canadian dollar british pound euro and australian dollar have an impact on the company’s reported results under gaap revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period consequently as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of the company’s nonus markets the company’s reported results vary 

during 2017  the us dollar fluctuated but generally weakened against the primary currencies in which the company conducts business currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing reported net service revenues by 11 million or 02 in 2017  compared to prior year the general weakening of the us dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the company’s foreign operations because substantially all of the company’s foreign operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency the unfavorable effect of higher reported operating expenses largely offset the increase in reported revenues reported net income was 08 million or 02 higher in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to prior year due to the effect of currency exchange rates 

for the month ended january 31 2018  the us dollar weakened against the euro british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar if currency exchange rates were to remain at january 2018  levels throughout 2018  the company’s 2018  fullyear reported revenues would be impacted favorably mostly offset by an unfavorable impact to operating expenses thus the impact to reported net income would likely be immaterial 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of the company’s stockholders’ equity the assets and liabilities of the company’s nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income although currency fluctuations impact the company’s reported results and shareholders’ equity such fluctuations generally do not affect cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses the company generally has few crossborder transfers of funds except for transfers to the us for payment of intercompany loans working capital loans made between the us and the company’s foreign subsidiaries and dividends from the company’s foreign subsidiaries

protiviti  faces competition in its efforts to attract clients and win proposal presentations the risk consulting and internal audit businesses are highly competitive in addition the changing regulatory environment is increasing opportunities for nonattestation audit and risk consulting services the principal competitors of protiviti  remain the “big four” accounting firms significant competitive factors include reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel protiviti  believes its competitive strengths lie in its unique ability to couple the deep skills and proven methodologies of its “big four” heritage with the customer focus and attention of a smaller organization

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the   company’s business and financial condition the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients certain of the company’s markets have recently or are currently experiencing prolonged economic downturns characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending in addition certain geopolitical events including the united kingdom’s vote to withdraw from the european union “brexit” have caused significant economic market political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the company’s markets any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits further continued or intensifying economic political or regulatory uncertainty in the company’s markets could reduce demand for the company’s services 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants the company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters as well as claims challenging the company’s compliance with the fair credit reporting act the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in addition 

an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets including europe for a significant portion of its business the european market has been experiencing ongoing economic uncertainty which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the company’s operations in europe in particular brexit has contributed to and may continue to contribute to european economic market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect european or worldwide economic market regulatory or political conditions to the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in europe related to brexit or otherwise continue or worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations in addition these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease the value of the us dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies and a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets when translated into us dollars to decline 

the company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under us or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws it cannot be sure that its employees contractors or agents will not violate such policies any such violations could materially damage the company’s reputation brand business and operating results further changes in us laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers and any negative sentiments towards the united states as a result of such changes could adversely affect the company’s operations 

government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the company’s future earnings in many jurisdictions in which the company operates the employment services industry is heavily regulated for example governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the company’s employees may be used in other countries special taxes fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees additionally trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions 

the countries in which we operate may among other things 

 any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the company to continue to provide employment services additionally as the company expands existing service offerings adds new service offerings or enters new markets it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business increase costs and impact profitability 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company operates in a highly competitive business   and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the 

company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information in many cases the company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the us and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company further changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the company’s operations in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins further lawsuits or other proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company for example the company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the fair credit reporting act it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation however such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings an unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states in 2015 the company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the ppaca’s employer mandate 

numerous statements made by president trump and members of the us congress indicate that it is likely that legislation will be passed by congress and signed into law by president trump that repeals the ppaca in whole or in part andor introduces a new form of health care reform it is unclear at this point what the scope of such legislation will be and when it will become effective because of the uncertainty surrounding this replacement health care reform legislation we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the ppaca’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the company’s financial condition or operating results whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the us there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the company’s health care expenditures may increase 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems some of which are managed by thirdparty vendors the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees and those of the company’s vendors in particular the company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems the misuse of which could result in legal liability cyberattacks including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the company in particular may disable or damage its systems it is possible that the company’s security controls or those of its thirdparty vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information such disclosure or damage to the company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the company introduces new service offerings it is also possible that certain jurisdictions may enact laws or regulations in respect of control of personal information that could increase the company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of its services the company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of its services the company’s business is reliant on a variety of technologies including those which support hiring and tracking order management billing and client data analytics if the company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments appropriately implement new technologies or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments the company’s services results of operations and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti  include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services for example the jumpstart our business startup “jobs” act signed into law in april of 2012 allows most companies going public in the us to defer implementation of some of the provisions of sarbanesoxley for up to five years after their initial public offering similarly there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the us congress to further delay or in some cases remove the requirements of sarbanesoxley for a number of public companies further many analysts are expecting the new us congress and president trump to seek to repeal or modify legislation that is viewed as having overregulated certain sectors of the us economy and decreased the incentive for us companies to go public and their ability to effectively compete with foreign competition these or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for protiviti’s services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results additionally the company’s clients will frequently enter into nonexclusive arrangements with several firms which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty the nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting our future results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti  is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified skilled personnel while protiviti  has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti  operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti  and many 

of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti  faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti  will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology personnel and other requirements to successfully compete 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti  consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti  for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti  or the company

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

because a portion of the company’s net revenues are derived from its operations outside the us and are denominated in 

local currencies the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company’s foreign subsidiaries exchange rates impact the us dollar value of the company’s reported revenues expenses earnings assets and liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 20  of the company’s revenues were generated outside of the united states these operations transact business in their functional currency which is the same as their local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly the canadian dollar british pound euro and australian dollar have an impact on the company’s reported results under gaap revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period consequently as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of the company’s nonus markets the company’s reported results vary 

during 2016  the us dollar fluctuated but generally strengthened against the primary currencies in which the company conducts business currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported net service revenues by 27 million or 05 in 2016  compared to prior year the general strengthening of the us dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the companys foreign operations because substantially all of the companys foreign operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency the favorable effect of lower reported operating expenses largely offset the decline in reported revenues reported net income was 05 million or 02 lower in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to prior year due to the effect of currency exchange rates 

for the month ended january 31 2017  the us dollar weakened against the euro british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar if currency exchange rates were to remain at january 2017  levels throughout 2017  the company’s 2017  fullyear reported revenues would be impacted favorably mostly offset by an unfavorable impact to operating expenses thus the impact to reported net income would likely be immaterial 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of the company’s stockholders’ equity the assets and liabilities of the company’s nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income although currency fluctuations impact the company’s reported results and shareholders’ equity such fluctuations generally do not affect cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses the company generally has few crossborder transfers of funds except for transfers to the us for payment of intercompany loans working capital loans made between the us and the company’s foreign subsidiaries and dividends from the company’s foreign subsidiaries

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

the global economic downturn may continue to harm the company’s business and financial condition  many of the company’s markets particularly in europe are currently experiencing a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending given the nature of the company’s business financial results could be significantly harmed should this downturn continue for an extended period of time or intensify in the past the company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand for staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods the impact of this downturn on the company’s business could be further dramatized given the severe impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the   company’s business the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants the company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters as well as claims challenging the company’s compliance with the fair credit reporting act the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to 

these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets including europe for a significant portion of its business the european market has been experiencing ongoing economic uncertainty which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the company’s operations in europe to the extent that these adverse economic conditions in europe continue or worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations in addition these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease the value of the us dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies and a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets when translated into us dollars to decline 

government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the company’s future earnings in many jurisdictions in which the company operates the employment services industry is heavily regulated for example governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the company’s employees may be used in other countries special taxes fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees additionally trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions 

the countries in which we operate may among other things 

 any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the company to continue to provide employment services additionally as the company expands existing service offerings adds new service offerings or enters new markets it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business increase costs and impact profitability 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company operates in a highly competitive business   and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material 

adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information in many cases the company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the us and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins further lawsuits or other proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company for example the company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the fair credit reporting act it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation however such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings an unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states the ppaca imposed new mandates on individuals and employers requiring most individuals to have health insurance and beginning in 2015 assessing penalties on large employers that do not offer health insurance that meets certain coverage value or affordability standards beginning 2015 the company has redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in a way that it believes meets the requirements of the ppaca’s employer mandate providing such additional health insurance benefits and an increase in the number of employees who elect to participate in the company’s health plans may significantly increase the company’s health carerelated costs as compared to historical periods while the company is attempting to recover these costs from its customers there can be no assurance that it will be successfully able to do so and any difficulties it encounters in recovering such costs will cause its financial results to suffer 

in addition because the regulations governing the ppaca’s employer mandate are new and subject to interpretation it is possible that despite the company’s efforts the company may incur liability in the form of penalties fines or damages if 

 the cost of any such penalties fines or damages could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial and operating results 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems some of which are managed by thirdparty vendors the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees and those of the company’s vendors in particular the company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems the misuse of which could result in legal liability cyberattacks including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the company in particular may disable or damage its systems it is possible that the company’s security controls or those of its thirdparty vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information such disclosure or damage to the company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the company introduces new service offerings 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of its services the company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of its services the company’s business is reliant on a variety of technologies including those which support hiring and tracking order management billing and client data analytics if the company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments appropriately implement new technologies or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments the company’s services results of operations and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti  include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services for example the jumpstart our business startup “jobs” act signed into law in april of 2012 allows most companies going public in the us to defer implementation of some of the provisions of sarbanesoxley for up to five years after their initial public offering similarly there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the us congress to further delay or in some cases remove the requirements of sarbanesoxley for a number of public companies these or other similar delays or modifications of the sarbanes oxley requirements could decrease demand for protiviti ’s services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results additionally the company’s clients will frequently enter into nonexclusive arrangements with several firms which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty the nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting our future results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti  is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified skilled personnel while protiviti  has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti  operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti  and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti  faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies 

price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti  will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology personnel and other requirements to successfully compete 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti  consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti  for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti  or the company

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

because a portion of the company’s net revenues are derived from its operations outside the us and are denominated in 

local currencies the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company’s foreign subsidiaries exchange rates impact the us dollar value of the company’s reported revenues expenses earnings assets and liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 19 of the company’s revenues were generated outside of the united states these operations transact business in their functional currency which is the same as their local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly the canadian dollar british pound euro and australian dollar have an impact on the company’s reported results under gaap revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period consequently as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of the company’s nonus markets the company’s reported results vary 

during 2015 the us dollar fluctuated but generally strengthened against the primary currencies in which the company conducts business currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported net service revenues by 162 million or 35 in 2015 compared to prior year the general strengthening of the us dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the companys foreign operations because substantially all of the companys foreign operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency the favorable effect of lower reported operating expenses largely offset the decline in reported revenues reported net income was 66 million or 22 lower in the year ended december 31 2015 compared to prior year due to the effect of currency exchange rates 

 for the month ended january 31 2016 the us dollar strengthened against the euro british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar if currency exchange rates were to remain at january 2016 levels throughout 2016 the company’s 2016 fullyear reported revenues would be impacted unfavorably mostly offset by a favorable impact to operating expenses thus the impact to reported net income would likely be immaterial 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of the company’s stockholders’ equity the assets and liabilities of the company’s nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income although currency fluctuations impact the company’s reported results and shareholders’ equity such fluctuations generally do not affect cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses the company generally has few crossborder transfers of funds except for transfers to the us for payment of intercompany loans working capital loans made between the us and the company’s foreign subsidiaries and dividends from the company’s foreign subsidiaries

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

the global economic downturn may continue to harm the company’s business and financial condition  many of the company’s markets particularly in europe are currently experiencing a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending given the nature of the company’s business financial results could be significantly harmed should this downturn continue for an extended period of time or intensify in the past the company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand for staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods the impact of this downturn on the company’s business could be further dramatized given the severe impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the   company’s business the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and 

representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters as well as claims challenging the company’s compliance with the fair credit reporting act the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets including europe for a significant portion of its business the european market has been experiencing ongoing economic uncertainty which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the company’s operations in europe to the extent that these adverse economic conditions in europe continue or worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations in addition these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease the value of the us dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies and a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets when translated into us dollars to decline 

government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the company’s future earnings in many jurisdictions in which the company operates the employment services industry is heavily regulated for example governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the company’s employees may be used in other countries special taxes fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees additionally trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions 

the countries in which we operate may among other things 

 any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the company to continue to provide employment services 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company operates in a highly competitive business   and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the 

company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins further lawsuits or other proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company for example the company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the fair credit reporting act it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation however such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings an unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states the ppaca imposed new mandates on individuals and employers requiring most individuals to have health insurance and beginning in 2015 assessing penalties on large employers that do not offer health insurance that meets certain coverage value or affordability standards beginning 2015 the company has redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in a way that it believes will meet the requirements of the ppaca’s employer mandate providing such additional health insurance benefits and an increase in the number of employees who elect to participate in the company’s health plans may significantly increase the company’s health carerelated costs while the company will attempt to recover these costs from its customers there can be no assurance that it will be successfully able to do so and if it cannot recover such costs its financial results will suffer 

in addition because the regulations governing the ppaca’s employer mandate are new and subject to interpretation it is possible that despite the company’s efforts the company may incur liability in the form of penalties fines or damages if 

 6 

 the cost of any such penalties fines or damages could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial and operating results 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees in particular the company’s employees may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems the misuse of which could result in legal liability cyberattacks including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the company in particular may disable or damage its systems it is possible that the company’s security controls over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information such disclosure or damage to the company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of its services the company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of its services the company’s business is reliant on a variety of technologies including those which support hiring and tracking order management billing and client data analytics if the company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments appropriately implement new technologies or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments the company’s services results of operations and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti  include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services for example the jumpstart our business startup “jobs” act signed into law in april of 2012 allows most companies going public in the us to defer implementation of some of the provisions of sarbanesoxley for up to five years after their initial public offering similarly there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the us congress to further delay or in some cases remove the requirements of sarbanesoxley for a number of public companies these or other similar delays or modifications of the sarbanes oxley requirements could decrease demand for protiviti’s services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti  is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti  has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti  operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti  and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti  faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies 

price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti  will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti  consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti  for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti  or the company

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

the global economic crisis may continue to harm the company’s business and financial condition  the world economy may continue in a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending given the nature of the company’s business financial results could be significantly harmed should such a prolonged downturn occur in the past the company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand for staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods this impact on the company’s business could be further dramatized given the unprecedented impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets 

  

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the c ompany’s business the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results  as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits alleging various wage and hour related claims that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets including europe for a significant portion of its business the european market has been experiencing ongoing economic uncertainty which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the company’s operations in europe to the extent that these adverse economic conditions in europe continue or worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations in addition these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

  

the company o perates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health care reform laws” were signed into law in the united states the health care reform laws include a large number of healthrelated provisions including requiring most individuals to have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans although the health care reform laws do not mandate that employers offer health insurance beginning in 2015 penalties will be assessed on large employers who do not offer health insurance that meets certain affordability or benefit requirements providing such additional health insurance benefits to the company’s employees or the payment of penalties if such coverage is not provided will increase the company’s expense if the company is unable to raise the rates it charges its clients to cover this expense such increases in expense could harm the company’s financial results 

  

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services for example the jumpstart our business startup “jobs” act signed into law in april of 2012 allows most companies going public in the us to defer implementation of some of the provisions of sarbanesoxley for up to five years after their initial public offering this or other similar delays or modifications of the sarbanes oxley requirements could decrease demand for protiviti’s services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from i the inability of its customers to make required payments ii temporary placement sales adjustments and iii permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90day guarantee period commonly referred to as “fall offs” the company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles historical loss statistics and current trends the adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period historically the company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances as a percentage of gross accounts receivable the company’s accounts receivable allowances totaled 47 and 46 as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively as of december 31 2013 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 14 million although future results cannot always be predicted by 

  

extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized valuation allowances of 370 million and 393 million were recorded as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the valuation allowances recorded related primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the related valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of june 30 2013 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required there were no events or changes in circumstances during the six months ended december 31 2013 that caused the company to perform an interim impairment assessment 

the company follows fasb authoritative guidance utilizing a twostep approach for determining goodwill impairment in the first step the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a present value technique derived from a discounted cash flow methodology for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are its lines of business the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed the second step under the fasb guidance is contingent upon the results of the first step to the extent a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value an indication exists that the reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment the second step involves allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to its net assets in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as of the assessment date the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 

the company’s reporting units are accountemps  robert half finance  accounting  officeteam  robert half technology  robert half management resources and protiviti  which had goodwill balances at december 31 2013 of 1274 million 266 million 00 million 72 million 00 million and 396 million respectively totaling 2008 million there were no changes to the company’s reporting units or to the allocations of goodwill by reporting unit for the year ended december 31 2013 

the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of future cash flows is based upon among other things a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future 

  

operating performance the discount rate for all reporting units was determined by management based on estimates of risk free interest rates beta and market risk premiums the discount rate used was compared to the rate published in various third party research reports which indicated that the rate was within a range of reasonableness the primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and profitability levels in addition the impairment assessment requires that management make certain judgments in allocating shared assets and liabilities to the balance sheets of the reporting units solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to its annual goodwill impairment testing the company made the following assumptions the company assumed that yeartodate trends through the date of the last assessment would continue for all reporting units through 2013 using unique assumptions for each reporting unit in addition the company applied profitability assumptions consistent with each reporting unit’s historical trends at various revenue levels and for years 2015 and beyond used a 5 growth factor to calculate the terminal value at the end of ten years for each unit this rate is comparable to the company’s most recent tenyear annual compound revenue growth rate in its most recent calculation the company used a 105 discount rate which is slightly higher than the 100 discount rate used for the company’s test during the second quarter of 2012 this increase in discount rate is attributable primarily to an increase in the risk free rate partially offset by a decrease in the equity market risk premium 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decreases to the fair values of each reporting unit the company determined that hypothetical decreases in fair value of at least 70 would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value 

given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the company’s goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if the company’s assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or profitability growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved the company may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material 

workers’ compensation  except for states which require participation in stateoperated insurance funds the company retains the economic burden for the first 05 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury claims in excess of 05 million are insured workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of 05 million claims administration fees charged by the company’s workers’ compensation administrator premiums paid to stateoperated insurance funds and an estimate for the company’s liability for incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims total workers’ compensation expense was 70 million 109 million and 79 million representing 022 036 and 030 of applicable us revenue for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the reserves for ibnr claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period include estimates the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future results based on the company’s results for the year ended december 31 2013 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the reserve of 02 million 

stockbased compensation under various stock plans officers employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock stock units stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock 

  

the company recognizes compensation expense equal to the grantdate fair value for all stockbased payment awards that are expected to vest this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the entire award unless the awards are subject to performance conditions in which case the company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche the company determines the grantdate fair value of its restricted stock and stock unit awards using the fair market value of its stock on the grant date unless the awards are subject to market conditions in which case the company utilizes a binomiallattice model ie monte carlo simulation model the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to determine the stockbased compensation expense for grants with market conditions made in the year ended december 31 2013 the company utilized an historical volatility of 3223 a 0 dividend yield and a riskfree interest rate of 036 the historical volatility was based on the most recent 261year period for the company and the components of the peer group the stock price projection for the company and the components of the peer group assumes a 0 dividend yield this is mathematically equivalent to reinvesting dividends in the issuing entity over the performance period the riskfree interest rate is equal to the yield as of the measurement date of the zerocoupon us treasury bill that is commensurate with the remaining performance measurement period 

no stock appreciation rights have been granted under the company’s existing stock plans 

the company determines the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the blackscholes valuation model the company recognizes expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and records adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates the company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006 there was no compensation expense related to stock options for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was 389 million 415 million and 509 million respectively of which 99 million 114 million and 133 million was related to grants made in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively a onepercentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a 04 million 04 million and 05 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for each year ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note b—“new accounting pronouncements” to the company’s consolidated financial statements included under part ii—item 8 of this report 

results of operations 

demand for the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad correspondingly results of operations were positively impacted by improving global economic conditions during 2013 because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends and the absence of material longterm contracts in any of our business units future demand for the company’s services cannot be forecasted with certainty we expect total company results to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2014 

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services business has 345 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and 18 foreign countries while protiviti has 59 offices in 23 states and 11 foreign countries 

because fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have an impact on the company’s results the company provides selected growth percentages below on a constantcurrency basis constantcurrency percentages are calculated using asreported amounts which have been retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period 

  

nongaap financial measures 

to help readers understand the company’s financial performance the company supplements its gaap financial results with revenue growth rates derived from nongaap revenue amounts variations in the company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and billing days the company provides “same billing days and constant currency” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items these calculations show the yearoveryear revenue growth rates for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing and permanent placement staffing segments on both a reported basis and also on a same day constantcurrency basis for global us and international operations the company has provided this data because management believes it better reflects the company’s actual revenue growth rates and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time the company expresses yearoveryear revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates 

in order to calculate constant currency revenue growth rates as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period management then calculates a global weightedaverage number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all staffing lines of business in order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days the company calculates same billing day revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount same billing day growth rates are then calculated based upon the per billing day amounts the term “same billing days and constant currency” means that the impact of different billing days has been removed from the constant currency calculation 

the nongaap financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the company’s industry as other companies may calculate such financial results differently the company’s nongaap financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with gaap the company does not consider these nongaap financial measures to be a substitute for or superior to the information provided by gaap financial results a reconciliation of the sameday constantcurrency revenue growth rates to the reported revenue growth rates is provided herein 

years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

revenues the company’s revenues were 425 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 increasing by 33 compared to 411 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 revenues from foreign operations represented 24 and 26 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services in 2013 revenues for all three of the company’s reportable segments were up compared to 2012 results were strongest domestically with growth rates outside the united states impacted by weaker economies in several countries most notably within europe contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail 

temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were 337 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 increasing by 14 compared to revenues of 332 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 on a sameday constantcurrency basis temporary and consultant staffing services revenues increased 16 for 2013 compared to 2012 in the us 2013 revenues increased 41 or 43 on a sameday basis compared to 2012 for the company’s international operations 2013 revenues decreased 67 and on a sameday constantcurrency basis decreased 65 compared to 2012 

permanent placement staffing revenues were 348 million for the year ended december 31 2013 increasing by 40 compared to revenues of 334 million for the year ended december 31 2012 on a sameday constantcurrency basis permanent placement revenues increased 51 for 2013 compared to 2012 in the 

  

us 2013 revenues increased 125 or 127 on a sameday basis compared to 2012 for the company’s international operations 2013 revenues decreased 75 and on a sameday constantcurrency basis decreased 53 compared to 2012 historically demand for permanent placement services is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for temporary and consulting staffing services and this is expected to continue 

a reconciliation of the nongaap yearoveryear revenue growth rates to the as reported yearoveryear revenue growth rates for the year ended december 31 2013 is presented in the following table 

 

 risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were 528 million for the year ended december 31 2013 increasing by 167 compared to revenues of 453 million for the year ended december 31 2012 contributing to the increase was higher demand in the us in the us 2013 revenues increased 205 compared to 2012 for the company’s international operations 2013 revenues increased 42 compared to 2012 

gross margin  the company’s gross margin dollars were 172 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 up 45 from 165 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 for 2013 compared to 2012 gross margin dollars for all three of the company’s reportable segments increased gross margin dollars as a percentage of revenues increased for both the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services segment and the risk consulting and internal audit services segment on a yearoveryear basis contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail

protiviti faces competition in its efforts to attract clients and win proposal presentations the risk consulting and internal audit businesses are highly competitive in addition the changing regulatory environment is increasing opportunities for nonattestation audit and risk consulting services the principal competitors of protiviti remain the “big four” accounting firms significant competitive factors include reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel protiviti believes its competitive strengths lie in its unique ability to couple the deep skills and proven methodologies of its “big four” heritage with the customer focus and attention of a smaller organization 

  

employees 

the company has approximately 12000 fulltime employees including approximately 2500 engaged directly in protiviti operations in addition the company placed approximately 191000 temporary employees on assignments with clients during 2012 employees placed by the company on assignment with clients are the company’s employees for all purposes while they are working on assignments the company pays the related costs of employment such as workers’ compensation insurance state and federal unemployment taxes social security and certain fringe benefits the company provides access to voluntary health insurance coverage to interested temporary employees

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

the global economic crisis may continue to harm the company’s business and financial condition  the world economy may continue in a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending given the nature of the company’s business financial results could be significantly harmed should such a prolonged downturn occur in the past the company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand for staffing services tends to 

  

significantly decrease during such periods this impact on the company’s business could be further dramatized given the unprecedented impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the c ompany’s business the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results  as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits alleging various wage and hour related claims that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets including europe for a significant portion of its business the financial uncertainty in europe including concerns that certain european countries may default in payments due on their national debt in recent months has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect sales of our services in europe to the extent that these adverse economic conditions in europe continue or worsen demand for the company’s services may decline which could significantly harm its business and results of operations in addition these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that 

  

candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company o perates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health care reform laws” were signed into law in the united states the health care reform laws include a large number of healthrelated provisions including requiring most individuals to have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans although the health care reform laws do not mandate that employers offer health insurance beginning in 2014 penalties will be assessed on large employers 

  

who do not offer health insurance that meets certain affordability or benefit requirements providing such additional health insurance benefits to the company’s employees or the payment of penalties if such coverage is not provided will increase the company’s expense if the company is unable to raise the rates it charges its clients to cover this expense such increases in expense could harm the company’s financial results 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services for example the jumpstart our business startup “jobs” act signed into law in april of 2012 allows most companies going public in the us to defer implementation of some of the provisions of sarbanesoxley for up to five years after their initial public offering this or other similar delays or modifications of the sarbanes oxley requirements could decrease demand for protiviti’s services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from i the inability of its customers to make required payments ii temporary placement sales adjustments and iii permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90day guarantee period commonly referred to as “fall offs” the company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles historical loss statistics and current trends the adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period historically the company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances as a percentage of gross accounts receivable the company’s accounts receivable allowances totaled 46 and 44 as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively as of december 31 2012 a 

  

fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 12 million although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized valuation allowances of 393 million and 363 million were recorded as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the valuation allowances recorded related primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of june 30 2012 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required there were no events or changes in circumstances during the six months ended december 31 2012 that caused the company to perform an interim impairment assessment 

the company follows fasb authoritative guidance utilizing a twostep approach for determining goodwill impairment in the first step the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a present value technique derived from a discounted cash flow methodology for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are its lines of business the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed the second step under the fasb guidance is contingent upon the results of the first step to the extent a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value an indication exists that the reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment the second step involves allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to its net assets in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as of the assessment date the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 

the company’s reporting units are accountemps  robert half finance  accounting  officeteam  robert half technology  robert half management resources and protiviti  which had goodwill balances at december 31 2012 of 1275 million 266 million 00 million 72 million 00 million and 400 million respectively totaling 2013 million there were no changes to the company’s reporting units or to the allocations of goodwill by reporting unit for the year ended december 31 2012 

  

the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of future cash flows is based upon among other things a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the discount rate for all reporting units was determined by management based on estimates of risk free interest rates beta and market risk premiums the discount rate used was compared to the rate published in various third party research reports which indicated that the rate was within a range of reasonableness the primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and profitability levels in addition the impairment assessment requires that management make certain judgments in allocating shared assets and liabilities to the balance sheets of the reporting units solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to its annual goodwill impairment testing the company made the following assumptions the company assumed that yeartodate trends through the date of the last assessment would continue for all reporting units through 2012 using unique assumptions for each reporting unit in addition the company applied profitability assumptions consistent with each reporting unit’s historical trends at various revenue levels and for years 2014 and beyond used a 5 growth factor to calculate the terminal value at the end of ten years for each unit this rate is comparable to the company’s most recent tenyear annual compound revenue growth rate in its most recent calculation the company used a 100 discount rate which is slightly higher than the 95 discount rate used for the company’s test during the second quarter of 2011 this increase in discount rate is attributable primarily to an increase in beta partially offset by a decrease in the risk free rate 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decreases to the fair values of each reporting unit the company determined that hypothetical decreases in fair value of at least 75 would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value 

given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the company’s goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if the company’s assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or profitability growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved the company may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material 

workers’ compensation  except for states which require participation in stateoperated insurance funds the company retains the economic burden for the first 05 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury claims in excess of 05 million are insured workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of 05 million claims administration fees charged by the company’s workers’ compensation administrator premiums paid to stateoperated insurance funds and an estimate for the company’s liability for incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims total workers’ compensation expense was 109 million 79 million and 66 million representing 036 030 and 029 of applicable us revenue for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the reserves for ibnr claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period include estimates the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future results based on the company’s results for the year ended december 31 2012 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the reserve of 04 million 

  

stockbased compensation under various stock plans officers employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock stock units stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock 

compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the stock’s fair market value on the grant date for restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche the company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest rather than record forfeitures when they occur if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods for purposes of calculating stockbased compensation expense for retirementeligible employees the service period is assumed to be met on the grant date or retirementeligible date whichever is later 

no stock appreciation rights have been granted under the company’s existing stock plans 

the company determines the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the blackscholes valuation model the company recognizes expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and records adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates the company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006 

for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 compensation expense related to stock options was 00 million 00 million and 02 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was 415 million 509 million and 569 million respectively of which 114 million 133 million and 122 million was related to grants made in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively a onepercentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a 04 million 05 million and 06 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for each year ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note b—“new accounting pronouncements” to the company’s consolidated financial statements included under part ii—item 8 of this report 

results of operations 

demand for the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad correspondingly results of operations were positively impacted by improving global economic conditions during 2012 because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends and the absence of material longterm contracts in any of our business units future demand for the company’s services cannot be forecasted with certainty we expect total company results to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2013 

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services business has 349 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and 19 foreign countries while protiviti has 60 offices in 23 states and 12 foreign countries 

because fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have an impact on the company’s results the company provides selected growth percentages below on a constantcurrency basis constantcurrency percentages are calculated using asreported amounts which have been retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period 

  

nongaap financial measures 

to help readers understand the company’s financial performance the company supplements its gaap financial results with revenue growth rates derived from nongaap revenue amounts variations in the company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and billing days the company provides “same billing days and constant currency” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items these calculations show the yearoveryear revenue growth rates for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing and permanent placement staffing segments on both a reported basis and also on a same day constantcurrency basis for global us and international operations the company has provided this data because management believes it better reflects the company’s actual revenue growth rates and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time the company expresses yearoveryear revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates 

in order to calculate constant currency revenue growth rates as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period management calculates a global weightedaverage number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all staffing lines of business in order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days the company calculates same billing day revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount same billing day growth rates are then calculated based upon the per billing day amounts the term “same billing days and constant currency” means that the impact of different billing days has been removed from the constant currency calculation 

the nongaap financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the company’s industry as other companies may calculate such financial results differently the company’s nongaap financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with gaap the company does not consider these nongaap financial measures to be a substitute for or superior to the information provided by gaap financial results a reconciliation of the sameday constantcurrency revenue growth rates to the reported revenue growth rates is provided herein

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

the global economic crisis may continue to harm the company’s business and financial condition  the world economy may continue in a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending given the nature of the company’s business financial results could be significantly harmed should such a prolonged downturn occur in the past the company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand for staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods this impact on the company’s business could be further dramatized 

  

given the unprecedented impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets in addition the impact of the economic crisis could harm the company’s financial condition at december 31 2011 the company had approximately 279 million in cash and cash equivalents the company has historically invested these amounts in us treasuries and government agencies bank deposits corporate debt money market funds commercial paper and municipal bonds meeting certain criteria certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks these risks associated with the company’s investment portfolio may negatively impact the company’s financial condition 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the c ompany’s business the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results  as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits alleging various wage and hour related claims that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters the various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law failure to comply with wage statement requirements and other related wage and hour violations such suits seek as applicable unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that 

  

candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company o perates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company in addition to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the company such as unemployment insurance taxes there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the company’s profit margins 

recent health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  the company may incur additional costs including without limitation increases in the cost of providing temporary employees as a result of the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 that was signed into law in march 2010 such an increase in costs could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profit margins or if the company increases its charges to clients upon the demand for the company’s services which could materially reduce revenues 

  

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from i the inability of its customers to make required payments ii temporary placement sales adjustments and iii permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90day guarantee period commonly referred to as “fall offs” the company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles historical loss statistics and current trends the adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period historically the company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances as a percentage of gross accounts receivable the company’s accounts receivable allowances totaled 44 and 48 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively as of december 31 2011 a five 

  

percentage point deviation in the company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 11 million although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized valuation allowances of 363 million and 310 million were recorded as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the valuation allowances recorded related primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of june 30 2011 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required there were no events or changes in circumstances during the six months ended december 31 2011 that caused the company to perform an interim impairment assessment 

fasb authoritative guidance requires a twostep approach for determining goodwill impairment in the first step the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a present value technique derived from a discounted cash flow methodology for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are its lines of business the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed the second step under the fasb guidance is contingent upon the results of the first step to the extent a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value an indication exists that the reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment the second step involves allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to its net assets in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as of the assessment date the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 

the company’s reporting units are accountemps  robert half finance  accounting  officeteam  robert half technology  robert half management resources and protiviti  which had goodwill balances at december 31 2011 of 1274 million 265 million 00 million 72 million 00 million and 283 million 

  

respectively totaling 1894 million there were no changes to the company’s reporting units or to the allocations of goodwill by reporting unit for the year ended december 31 2011 

the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of future cash flows is based upon among other things a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the discount rate for all reporting units was determined by management based on estimates of risk free interest rates beta and market risk premiums the discount rate used was compared to the rate published in various third party research reports which indicated that the rate was within a range of reasonableness the primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and profitability levels in addition the impairment assessment requires that management make certain judgments in allocating shared assets and liabilities to the balance sheets of the reporting units solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to its annual goodwill impairment testing the company made the following assumptions the company assumed that yeartodate trends through the date of the last assessment would continue for all reporting units through 2011 using unique assumptions for each reporting unit in addition the company applied profitability assumptions consistent with each reporting unit’s historical trends at various revenue levels and for years 2013 and beyond used a 5 growth factor to calculate the terminal value at the end of ten years for each unit this rate is comparable to the company’s most recent tenyear annual compound revenue growth rate in its most recent calculation the company used a 95 discount rate which is slightly lower than the 96 discount rate used for the company’s test during the second quarter of 2010 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decreases to the fair values of each reporting unit the company determined that hypothetical decreases in fair value of at least 70 would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value 

given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the company’s goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if the company’s assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or profitability growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved the company may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material 

workers’ compensation  except for states which require participation in stateoperated insurance funds the company retains the economic burden for the first 05 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury claims in excess of 05 million are insured workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of 05 million claims administration fees charged by the company’s workers’ compensation administrator premiums paid to stateoperated insurance funds and an estimate for the company’s liability for incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims total workers’ compensation expense was 79 million 66 million and 50 million representing 030 029 and 023 of applicable us revenue for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the reserves for ibnr claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future results based on the company’s results for the year ended december 31 2011 a five

stockbased compensation under various stock plans officers employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock stock units stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock 

compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the stock’s fair market value on the grant date for restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche the company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest rather than record forfeitures when they occur if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods for purposes of calculating stockbased compensation expense for retirementeligible employees the service period is assumed to be met on the grant date or retirementeligible date whichever is later 

no stock appreciation rights have been granted under the company’s existing stock plans 

the company determines the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the blackscholes valuation model the company recognizes expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and records adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates the company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006 

for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 compensation expense related to stock options was 00 million 02 million and 08 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was 509 million 569 million and 603 million respectively of which 133 million 122 million and 120 million was related to grants made in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively a onepercentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a 05 million 06 million and 06 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for each year ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

the global economic crisis may continue to harm the company’s business and financial condition  the world economy may continue in a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending given the nature of the company’s business financial results could be significantly harmed should such a prolonged downturn occur in the past the company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand for staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods this impact on the company’s business could be further dramatized 

  

given the unprecedented impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets in addition the impact of the economic crisis could harm the company’s financial condition at december 31 2010 the company had approximately 315 million in cash and cash equivalents the company has historically invested these amounts in us treasuries and government agencies bank deposits corporate debt money market funds commercial paper and municipal bonds meeting certain criteria certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks these risks associated with the company’s investment portfolio may negatively impact the company’s financial condition 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the c ompany’s business the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results  as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits alleging various wage and hour claims that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour matters all of such lawsuits allege among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law and other related wage and hour violations and seek an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime compensation statutory penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its incentive compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that 

  

candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company o perates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company 

recent health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  the company may incur additional costs including without limitation increases in the cost of providing temporary employees as a result of the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 that was signed into law in march 2010 such an increase in costs could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profit margins or if the company increases its charges to clients upon the demand for the company’s services which could materially reduce revenues 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and 

  

largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

  

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from i the inability of its customers to make required payments ii temporary placement sales adjustments and iii permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90day guarantee period commonly referred to as “fall offs” the company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles historical loss statistics and current trends the adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period historically the company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances as a percentage of gross accounts receivable the company’s accounts receivable allowances totaled 48 and 56 as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively as of december 31 2010 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 11 million although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized valuation allowances of 310 million and 212 million were recorded as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively the valuation allowances recorded related primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of june 30 2010 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required there were no events or changes in circumstances during the six months ended december 31 2010 that caused the company to perform an interim impairment assessment 

fasb authoritative guidance requires a twostep approach for determining goodwill impairment in the first step the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a present value technique derived from a discounted cash flow methodology for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are its lines of business the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed the second step under the fasb guidance is contingent upon the results of the first step to the extent a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value an indication exists that the reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform a second more detailed impairment 

  

assessment the second step involves allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to its net assets in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as of the assessment date the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 

the company’s reporting units are accountemps  robert half finance  accounting  officeteam  robert half technology  robert half management resources and protiviti  which had goodwill balances at december 31 2010 of 1274 million 266 million 00 million 72 million 00 million and 286 million respectively totaling 1898 million there were no changes to the company’s reporting units or to the allocations of goodwill by reporting unit for the year ended december 31 2010 

the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of future cash flows is based upon among other things a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the discount rate for all reporting units was determined by management based on estimates of risk free interest rates beta and market risk premiums the discount rate used was compared to the rate published in various third party research reports which indicated that the rate was within a range of reasonableness the primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and profitability levels in addition the impairment assessment requires that management make certain judgments in allocating shared assets and liabilities to the balance sheets of the reporting units solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to its annual goodwill impairment testing the company made the following assumptions the company assumed that yeartodate trends through the date of the last assessment would continue for all reporting units through 2010 followed by a recovery period in 2011 and 2012 using unique assumptions for each reporting unit in addition the company applied profitability assumptions consistent with each reporting unit’s historical trends at various revenue levels and for years beyond 2012 used a 5 growth factor to calculate the terminal value at the end of ten years for each unit this rate is comparable to the company’s most recent tenyear annual compound revenue growth rate in its most recent calculation the company used a 96 discount rate which is lower than the 107 discount rate used for the company’s test during the second quarter of 2009 this decline in discount rate is primarily due to a decline in beta and the market risk premium 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decreases to the fair values of each reporting unit the company determined that hypothetical decreases in fair value of at least 48 would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value 

given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn or the period or strength of recovery made for purposes of the company’s goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if the company’s assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or profitability growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved the company may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material 

workers’ compensation  except for states which require participation in stateoperated insurance funds the company retains the economic burden for the first 05 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury claims in excess of 05 million are insured workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of 05 million claims administration fees charged by the company’s workers’ compensation administrator premiums paid to stateoperated insurance funds and an estimate for the company’s liability for incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims total workers’ compensation expense was 66 million 50 million and 121 million representing 029 023 and 037 of applicable us revenue for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

the reserves for ibnr claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future results based on the company’s results for the year ended december 31 2010 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the reserve of 03 million 

stockbased compensation under various stock plans officers employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock stock units stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock 

compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the stock’s fair market value on the grant date for restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche the company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest rather than record forfeitures when they occur if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods for purposes of calculating stockbased compensation expense for retirementeligible employees the service period is assumed to be met on the grant date or retirementeligible date whichever is later 

no stock appreciation rights have been granted under the company’s existing stock plans 

the company determines the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the blackscholes valuation model the company recognizes expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and records adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates the company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006 

for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 compensation expense related to stock options was 02 million 08 million and 51 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was 569 million 603 million and 636 million respectively of which 122 million 120 million and 170 million was related to grants made in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively a onepercentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a 06 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for each year ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008

results of operations 

demand for the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad correspondingly results of operations were negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions throughout 2009 and in the early portion of 2010 because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends and the absence of material longterm contracts in any of our business units future demand for the company’s services cannot be forecasted with certainty we expect total company results to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2011

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

the global economic crisis may continue to harm the company’s business and financial condition  the world economy may continue in a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending given the nature of the company’s business financial results could be significantly harmed should such a prolonged downturn occur in the past the company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand for staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods this impact on the company’s business could be further dramatized given the unprecedented impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets in addition the impact of the economic crisis could harm the company’s financial condition at december 31 2009 the 

  

company had approximately 366 million in cash and cash equivalents the company has historically invested these amounts in us treasuries and government agencies bank deposits corporate debt money market funds commercial paper and municipal bonds meeting certain criteria certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks these risks associated with the company’s investment portfolio may negatively impact the company’s financial condition 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the c ompany’s business the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results  as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representative action lawsuits alleging various wage and hour claims that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in five class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour matters four of such lawsuits allege among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law and other related wage and hour violations and seek an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime compensation statutory penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees the fifth lawsuit alleges among other things that temporary employees in california were improperly denied expense reimbursement and wages for time purportedly spent preparing for traveling to and attending interviews and seeks compensation for such expenses and wages penalties and injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in addition an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the company to change its incentive compensation plans for its employees which could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar declines relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that 

  

candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company o perates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company 

health care reform could increase the costs of the company’s temporary staffing operations  health care reform may be addressed by congress during 2010 depending upon the provisions of any final legislation that is adopted the cost to the company of providing temporary employees may be increased by the terms of the reform such an increase in costs could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profit margins or if the company increases its charges to clients upon the demand for the company’s services which could materially reduce revenues 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and 

  

largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

  

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from i the inability of its customers to make required payments ii temporary placement sales adjustments and iii permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90day guarantee period commonly referred to as “fall offs” the company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles historical loss statistics and current trends the adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period historically the company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances as a percentage of gross accounts receivable the company’s accounts receivable allowances totaled 56 and 66 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively as of december 31 2009 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 11 million although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in relation to actual net operating losses in certain foreign operations valuation allowances of 212 million were recorded as of december 31 2009 if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will benefit its deferred tax assets up to the full amount of the valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the three months ended june 30 2009 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required there were no events or changes in circumstances during the six months ended december 31 2009 that caused the company to perform an interim impairment assessment 

fasb authoritative guidance requires a twostep approach for determining goodwill impairment in the first step the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a present value technique derived from a discounted cash flow methodology for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are its lines of business the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed the second step under the fasb guidance is contingent upon the results of the first step to the extent a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value an indication exists that the reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform a second more detailed impairment 

  

assessment the second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to its net assets in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as of the assessment date the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 

the company’s reporting units are accountemps  robert half finance  accounting  officeteam  robert half technology  robert half management resources and protiviti  which had goodwill balances at december 31 2009 of 1275 million 266 million 00 million 72 million 00 million and 280 million respectively totaling 1893 million there were no changes to the company’s reporting units or to the allocations of goodwill by reporting unit through december 31 2009 

the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of future cash flows is based upon among other things a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the discount rate for all reporting units was determined by management based on estimates of risk free interest rates beta and market risk premiums the discount rate used was compared to the rate published in various third party research reports which indicated that the rate was within a range of reasonableness the primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and profitability levels in addition the impairment assessment requires that management make certain judgments in allocating shared assets and liabilities to the balance sheets of the reporting units solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to its annual goodwill impairment testing the company made the following assumptions the company assumed that the current economic downturn would continue for all reporting units through 2010 followed by a recovery period in 2011 and 2012 using unique assumptions for each reporting unit in addition the company applied profitability assumptions consistent with each reporting unit’s historical trends at various revenue levels and for years beyond 2012 used a 5 growth factor to calculate the terminal value at the end of ten years for each unit this rate is consistent with the rate used for the company’s interim test during the first quarter of 2009 and is significantly lower than the company’s historical tenyear annual compound revenue growth rate in its most recent calculation the company used a 107 discount rate which is slightly lower than the 109 discount rate used for the company’s interim test during the first quarter of 2009 this decline in discount rate is primarily due to a decline in the market risk premium partially offset by an increase in the risk free rate 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decreases to the fair values of each reporting unit the company determined that hypothetical decreases in fair value of at least 30 would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value 

given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company’s estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn or the period or strength of recovery made for purposes of the company’s goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if the company’s assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or profitability growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved the company may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material 

workers’ compensation  except for states which require participation in stateoperated insurance funds the company retains the economic burden for the first 05 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury claims in excess of 05 million are insured workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of 05 million claims administration fees charged by the company’s workers’ compensation administrator premiums paid to stateoperated insurance funds and an estimate for the company’s liability for incurred but not reported “ibnr” 

  

claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims total workers’ compensation expense was 50 million and 121 million representing 023 and 037 of applicable us revenue for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the accrual for ibnr claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future results based on the company’s results for the year ended december 31 2009 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the reserve of 01 million 

stockbased compensation under various stock plans officers employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock stock units stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock 

compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the stock’s fair market value on the grant date for restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche the company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest rather than record forfeitures when they occur if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods for purposes of calculating stockbased compensation expense for retirementeligible employees the service period is assumed to be met on the grant date or retirementeligible date whichever is later 

no stock appreciation rights have been granted under the company’s existing stock plans 

the company determines the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the blackscholes valuation model the company recognizes expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and records adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates the company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006 

for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 compensation expense related to stock options was 08 million 51 million and 92 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was 603 million 636 million and 538 million respectively of which 120 million 170 million and 211 million was related to grants made in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively a onepercentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a 06 million 06 million and 05 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

recent accounting pronouncements 

determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly in april 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which highlights and expands on the factors that should be considered in estimating fair value when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for a financial asset this authoritative guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ending after june 15 2009 the adoption of this guidance during the three months ended june 30 2009 did not have an impact on the company’s financial statements

results of operations 

demand for the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad correspondingly results of operations were negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions in the latter portion of 2008 and throughout 2009 because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic 

  

trends and the absence of material longterm contracts in any of our business units future demand for the company’s services cannot be forecasted with certainty we expect total company results to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2010 

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 365 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and 20 foreign countries while protiviti has more than 60 offices in 23 states and 16 foreign countries 

because fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have an impact on the company’s results the company provides selected growth percentages below on a constantcurrency basis constantcurrency percentages are calculated using asreported amounts which have been retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period 

years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

revenues the company’s revenues were 30 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 down 34 from 46 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 revenues from foreign operations represented 29 of total revenues for both the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 the company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments temporary and consultant staffing permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services in 2009 revenues for all three of the company’s reportable segments were down compared to 2008 contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail 

temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were 25 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 down 32 from revenues of 36 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 on a constantcurrency basis temporary and consultant staffing services revenues decreased 30 for 2009 compared to 2008 throughout 2009 demand for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services was significantly impacted by difficult global labor markets and weak general macroeconomic conditions in the united states 2009 revenues decreased 32 compared to 2008 the company’s revenues from foreign operations decreased 31 for 2009 compared to 2008 on a constantcurrency basis the company’s revenues from foreign operations decreased 25 for 2009 compared to 2008 

permanent placement revenues were 182 million for the year ended december 31 2009 down 57 from revenues of 427 million for the year ended december 31 2008 on a constantcurrency basis permanent placement revenues decreased 56 for 2009 compared to 2008 in the united states 2009 revenues decreased 62 compared to 2008 historically demand for permanent placement services is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for temporary and consulting staffing services and this is expected to continue the december 2009 unemployment rate in the us was 10 its highest level since 1983 the company’s revenues from foreign operations decreased 51 for 2009 compared to 2008 on a constantcurrency basis the company’s revenues from foreign operations decreased 48 for 2009 compared to 2008 

risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were 384 million for the year ended december 31 2009 down 30 from revenues of 547 million for the year ended december 31 2008 on a constantcurrency basis risk consulting and internal audit services revenues decreased 29 for 2009 compared to 2008 as weak global macroeconomic conditions negatively impacted demand contributing to the decrease was a decline in revenues produced by compliancerelated projects mainly those tied to the sarbanesoxley act a trend which may continue in the united states 2009 revenues decreased 29 compared to 2008 the company’s revenues from foreign operations decreased 31 for 2009 compared to 2008 on a constantcurrency basis the company’s revenues from foreign operations decreased 28 for 2009 compared to 2008 

gross margin the company’s gross margin dollars were 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 down 42 from 19 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 for 2009 compared to 2008 gross margin dollars for all three of the company’s reportable segments decreased under difficult economic conditions 

  

gross margin dollars as a percentage of revenues also decreased for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services divisions on a yearoveryear basis contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail 

gross margin dollars from the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services which consist of payroll payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees and reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services division were 842 million for the year ended december 31 2009 down 37 from 13 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 on a constantcurrency basis temporary and consultant staffing services gross margin dollars decreased 35 for 2009 compared to 2008 as a percentage of revenues gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing services were 341 in 2009 down from 367 in 2008 this yearover year decrease was the result of significantly lower conversion revenues and compression of paybill spreads in 2009 compared to 2008 conversion revenues are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position as there are no direct costs related to conversion revenues the gross margin percentage is favorably impacted as the mix of conversion revenues increases paybill spreads represent the differential between wages paid to temporary employees and amounts billed to clients 

gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services represent revenues less reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars for the company’s permanent placement staffing division were 182 million for the year ended december 31 2009 down 57 from 427 million for the year ended december 31 2008 on a constantcurrency basis permanent placement gross margin dollars decreased 56 for 2009 compared to 2008 because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing services are de minimis the decrease in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the decrease in revenues previously discussed

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

the global financial crisis may harm the company’s business and financial condition  many financial and economic analysts are predicting that the world economy may be entering into a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending given the nature of the company’s business financial results could be significantly harmed should such a downturn occur in the past the company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand for staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods this impact on the company’s business could be further dramatized during the current downturn given the unprecedented impact it has had and may continue to have on the global credit markets in addition the impact of the credit 

  

crisis could harm the company’s financial condition at december 31 2008 the company had approximately 355 million in cash and cash equivalents the company has historically invested these amounts in us treasuries and government agencies bank deposits corporate debt money market funds commercial paper and municipal bonds meeting certain criteria certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks these risks associated with the company’s investment portfolio may negatively impact the company’s financial condition 

any reduction in global economic activity may harm the c ompany’s business the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

the company faces risks in operating internationally the company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business these international operations are subject to a number of risks including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations us legal requirements governing us companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations in addition the company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations in particular the company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the us dollar if the value of the us dollar declines relative to other currencies the company’s reported income from these operations could decrease 

the company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

the company o perates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

the company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results  as a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services the company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants if the company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the company’s clients the company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed 

the company may incur potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect 

  

upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees or allegations of misuse of client confidential information the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

the company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

the company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company in addition the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption the company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems the company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and errors in usage by the company’s employees 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the company’s financial reporting if the company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls are identified the company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in addition if the company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis which could cause its stock price to fall 

the demand for the company’s services related to sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance may decline the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services 

longterm contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the company’s revenue because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representative action lawsuits alleging various wage and hour claims that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representative action lawsuits brought by or 

  

on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour matters the company and certain subsidiaries are currently defendants in four such lawsuits all of which are pending in california three of such lawsuits allege among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under federal and state law and other related wage and hour violations and seek an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime compensation statutory penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees the fourth lawsuit alleges among other things that temporary employees in california were improperly denied expense reimbursement and wages for time purportedly spent preparing for traveling to and attending interviews and seeks compensation for such expenses and wages penalties and injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel   protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability the business of protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from i the inability of its customers to make required payments ii temporary placement sales adjustments and iii permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90day guarantee period commonly referred to as “fall offs” the company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles historical loss statistics and current trends the adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period historically the company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances as a percentage of gross accounts receivable the company’s accounts receivable allowances totaled 66 and 46 as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively as of december 31 2008 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 17 million although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to 

  

deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in relation to actual net operating losses in certain foreign operations valuation allowances of 146 million were recorded as of december 31 2008 if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will benefit its deferred tax assets up to the full amount of the valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment assessments for goodwill are done at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are its lines of business in performing periodic impairment tests the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value including goodwill and intangible assets if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the carrying value exceeds the fair value however an impairment condition may exist 

the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of future cash flows is based upon among other things a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the discount rate used by management has been calculated on a consistent basis and has not fluctuated significantly the primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and expense levels these assumptions are updated annually and are primarily based upon historical trends the company’s estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance although management believes the assumptions and estimates made in its goodwill impairment analysis to be reasonable and appropriate different assumptions could materially impact the company’s reported financial results as of december 31 2008 and 2007 total goodwill equaled 1875 million and 1911 million respectively the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required 

workers’ compensation  except for states which require participation in stateoperated insurance funds the company retains the economic burden for the first 05 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury claims in excess of 05 million are insured workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of 05 million claims administration fees charged by the company’s workers’ compensation administrator premiums paid to stateoperated insurance funds and an estimate for the company’s liability for incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims total workers’ compensation expense was 121 

  

million and 94 million representing 037 and 027 of applicable us revenue for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

the accrual for ibnr claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future results based on the company’s results for the year ended december 31 2008 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the reserve of 05 million 

stockbased compensation under various stock plans officers employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock stock units stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock 

compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the stock’s fair market value on the grant date for restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche the company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest rather than record forfeitures when they occur if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods for purposes of calculating stockbased compensation expense for retirementeligible employees the service period is assumed to be met on the grant date or retirementeligible date whichever is later 

no stock appreciation rights have been granted under the company’s existing stock plans 

the company determines the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the blackscholes valuation model the company recognizes expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and records adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates the company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006 

for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was 636 million 538 million and 408 million respectively of which 170 million 211 million and 102 million was related to grants made in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively a onepercentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a 06 million 05 million and 04 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

recent accounting pronouncements

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

business highly dependent upon the state of the economy the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

  

availability of candidates the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

highly competitive business the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

reputation  the success of the company’s staffing and protiviti businesses is highly dependent upon their reputations any event that adversely impacts the reputation of either business could materially adversely affect the company 

potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination or harassment while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

dependence upon personnel the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

government regulation the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company 

government regulation of the workplace the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company 

demand for services the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services 

  

reliance on shortterm contracts because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representative action lawsuits alleging various wage and hour claims that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour matters the company and certain subsidiaries are currently defendants in four such lawsuits in california and one such lawsuit in massachusetts all five lawsuits allege among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under federal and state law and other related wage and hour violations and seek an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime compensation statutory penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

protiviti dependence on personnel protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti competition protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

potential liability the business of protiviti consists of providing internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from i the inability of its customers to make required payments ii temporary placement sales adjustments and iii permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90day guarantee period commonly referred to as “fall offs” the company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles historical loss statistics and current trends the adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period historically the company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances as a percentage of gross accounts receivable the company’s accounts receivable allowances totaled 46 and 41 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively as of december 31 2007 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 14 million although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are 

  

applicable to its operations deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in relation to actual net operating losses in certain foreign operations valuation allowances of 127 million were recorded as of december 31 2007 if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will benefit its deferred tax assets up to the full amount of the valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment assessments for goodwill are done at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are its lines of business in performing periodic impairment tests the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value including goodwill and intangible assets if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the carrying value exceeds the fair value however an impairment condition may exist 

the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of future cash flows is based upon among other things a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the discount rate used by management has been calculated on a consistent basis and has not fluctuated significantly the primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and expense levels these assumptions are updated annually and are primarily based upon historical trends although management does not anticipate that these assumptions will change materially in the future the company’s estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required based upon the company’s most recent goodwill impairment analysis management believes that unless a reporting unit were to be abandoned the possibility of goodwill impairment as a result of a change in assumptions is unlikely 

workers’ compensation  except for states which require participation in stateoperated insurance funds the company retains the economic burden for the first 05 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury claims in excess of 05 million are insured workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of 05 million claims administration fees charged by the company’s workers’ compensation administrator premiums paid to stateoperated insurance funds and an estimate for the company’s liability for incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims total workers’ compensation expense was 94 and 124 million representing 027 and 039 of applicable us revenue for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

the accrual for ibnr claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss 

  

development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future results based on the company’s results for the year ended december 31 2007 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 03 million 

stockbased compensation  under various stock plans officers employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock stock units stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” using the modified prospective transition method accordingly prior periods have not been restated stockbased compensation expense recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements “financial statements” for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 included compensation expense for stock options which includes grants made prior to but not yet vested as of december 31 2005 as well as stock options granted subsequent to december 31 2005 

beginning in 2005 the company significantly decreased its use of stock options as part of its compensation programs for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 the company’s pretax stockbased compensation cost from options totaled 92 million and 176 million respectively under both sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas 123” and sfas 123r the company determined the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model 

sfas 123r requires the company to recognize compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest rather than record forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was 538 million and 408 million respectively of which 211 million and 102 million was related to grants made in 2007 and 2006 respectively a onepercentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a 05 million and 04 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities “sfas 159” which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards the election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings this statement is effective as of january 1 2008 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 159 to have a material impact on its financial statements 

in june 2007 the fasb ratified emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0611 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on sharebased payment awards “eitf 0611” eitf 0611 requires that tax benefits generated by dividends paid during the vesting period on certain equityclassified sharebased compensation awards be classified as additional paidin capital and included in a pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies from sharebased payment awards eitf 0611 is effective as of january 1 2008 the company does not expect the adoption of eitf 0611 to have a material impact on its financial statements 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations “sfas no 141r” sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas no 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the company is in the process of analyzing the impact of sfas no 141r on its financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51 “sfas no 160” sfas no 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas no 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the company is in the process of analyzing the impact of sfas no 160 on its financial statements 

results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2007 

temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were 36 billion 31 billion and 26 billion for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively increasing by 16 and 19 in 2007 and 2006 respectively on a constantcurrency basis temporary and consultant staffing services revenues increased 14 and 18 for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively permanent placement revenues were 444 million 336 million and 219 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively increasing by 32 and 53 in 2007 and 2006 respectively on a constantcurrency basis permanent placement services revenues increased 29 and 52 for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively improvement in both domestic and international markets particularly continental europe contributed to the increase in temporary and permanent staffing services revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were 552 million 543 million and 479 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively increasing by 2 and 13 in 2007 and 2006 respectively on a constantcurrency basis risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were flat and increased 13 for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the 2007 increase in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to higher international revenues particularly in asia there can be no assurances that there will be ongoing demand for sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance services or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results we expect total company revenues to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2008 

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 360 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and eighteen foreign countries while protiviti has 60 offices in 22 states and fourteen foreign countries revenues from foreign operations represented 24 21 and 19 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

gross margin dollars from the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services which consist of payroll payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees and reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services represent revenues less reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services which consist primarily of professional staff payroll payroll taxes insurance costs and reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services were 14 billion 12 billion and 963 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively increasing by 17 and 20 in 2007 and 2006 respectively on a constantcurrency 

  

basis temporary and consultant staffing services gross margin dollars increased 15 and 18 for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively gross margin amounts equaled 37 37 and 36 of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

gross margin dollars for the company’s permanent placement staffing division were 444 million 336 million and 219 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively increasing by 32 and 53 in 2007 and 2006 respectively on a constantcurrency basis permanent placement staffing services gross margin dollars increased 29 and 52 for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively

selling general and administrative expenses were 15 billion in 2007 compared to 12 billion in 2006 and 991 million in 2005 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 32 31 and 30 for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation advertising depreciation and occupancy costs the 2007 increase relates primarily to higher staff compensation costs 

for acquisitions the company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets if any and then to goodwill identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives typically ranging from two to five years goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required net intangible assets consisting primarily of goodwill represented 13 of total assets and 20 of total stockholders’ equity at december 31 2007 

interest income for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was 172 million 193 million and 121 million respectively lower 2007 interest income resulted from lower average cash balances partially offset by higher interest rates interest expense for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was 41 million 25 million and 11 million respectively

competition 

the company’s staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates the staffing business is highly competitive with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the company on a national regional or local basis in many areas the local companies are the strongest competitors the most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel the company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience with and commitment to the specialized employment market its national presence and its various marketing activities 

  

protiviti faces competition in its efforts to attract clients and win proposal presentations the risk consulting and internal audit businesses are highly competitive due to many new firms entering the market and the evolution of established firms in the business space in addition the changing regulatory environment is increasing opportunities for nonattestation audit and risk consulting services the principal competitors of protiviti remain the “big four” accounting firms significant competitive factors include reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel protiviti believes its competitive strengths lie in its unique ability to couple the deep skills and proven methodologies of its “big four” heritage with the customer focus and attention of a smaller organization

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

business highly dependent upon the state of the economy the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

availability of candidates the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

highly competitive business the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

reputation  the success of the company’s staffing and protiviti businesses is highly dependent upon their reputations any event that adversely impacts the reputation of either business could materially adversely affect the company 

potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination or harassment while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

dependence upon personnel the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

government regulation the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or 

  

approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company 

government regulation of the workplace the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company 

demand for services the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services 

reliance on shortterm contracts because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representative action lawsuits alleging various wage and hour claims that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour matters the company and certain subsidiaries are currently defendants in four such lawsuits in california and one such lawsuit in massachusetts all five lawsuits allege among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under federal and state law and other related wage and hour violations and seek an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime compensation statutory penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

protiviti dependence on personnel protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

protiviti competition protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

potential liability the business of protiviti consists of providing internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from i the inability of its customers to make required payments ii temporary placement sales adjustments and iii permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90day guarantee period commonly referred to as “fall offs” the company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles historical loss statistics and current trends the adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period historically the company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances as a percentage of gross accounts receivable the company’s accounts receivable allowances totaled 41 and 44 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively as of december 31 2006 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 11 million although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are 

  

applicable to its operations deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 

the company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events including operating results to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized when appropriate a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in relation to actual net operating losses in certain foreign operations valuation allowances of 115 million were recorded as of december 31 2006 if such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income the company will benefit its deferred tax assets up to the full amount of the valuation reserve 

while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

employee retirement plans  for the year ended december 31 2005 the determination of the company’s obligations for its defined benefit retirement agreement for the company’s chief executive officer was dependent upon the following assumptions expected retirement age mortality expected postretirement consumer price index “cpi” increases and discount rates these assumptions were evaluated and updated each reporting period a historical longterm average rate was used for cpi while a current long term market rate was used for the discount rate as of december 31 2005 the cpi rate used in calculating the liability was 28 the discount rate used in calculating this liability as of december 31 2005 was 40 

effective october 1 2006 the key executive retirement plan the “retirement agreement” and the company’s deferred compensation plan the “dcp” were amended future benefit accruals under the retirement agreement were frozen and converted from a traditional defined benefit plan into a deferred compensation arrangement within the dcp with market rate interest amounts credited in the future on the converted amount the balance in the retirement agreement as of october 1 2006 of 49 million calculated by the company and its independent actuarial advisors was transferred to the dcp as of december 31 2006 employee benefit and retirement obligations included 53 million for the company’s chief executive officer for the dcp and other benefits 

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment assessments for goodwill are done at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are its lines of business in performing periodic impairment tests the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value including goodwill and intangible assets if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the carrying value exceeds the fair value however an impairment condition exists 

the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of future cash flows is based upon among other things a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the discount rate used by management has been calculated on a consistent basis and has not fluctuated significantly the primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and expense levels these assumptions are updated annually and are primarily based upon historical trends although management does not anticipate that these assumptions will change materially in the future the company’s estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required based upon the company’s 

  

most recent goodwill impairment analysis management believes that unless a reporting unit were to be abandoned the possibility of goodwill impairment as a result of a change in assumptions is unlikely 

workers’ compensation  except for states which require participation in stateoperated insurance funds the company retains the economic burden for the first 05 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury claims in excess of 05 million are insured workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of 05 million claims administration fees charged by the company’s workers’ compensation administrator premiums paid to stateoperated insurance funds and an estimate for the company’s liability for incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims total workers’ compensation expense was 124 million and 114 million representing 039 and 042 of applicable us revenue for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

the accrual for ibnr claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future results based on the company’s results for the year ended december 31 2006 a fivepercentage point deviation in the company’s estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of 05 million 

stockbased compensation  under various stock plans officers employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock stock units stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” using the modified prospective transition method accordingly prior periods have not been restated stockbased compensation expense recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements “financial statements” for the year ended december 31 2006 included compensation expense for stock options which includes grants made prior to but not yet vested as of december 31 2005 as well as stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2006 

beginning in 2005 the company significantly decreased its use of stock options as part of its compensation programs for the year ended december 31 2006 the company’s pretax stockbased compensation cost from options totaled 176 million under both sfas no 123 “sfas 123” accounting for stockbased compensation and sfas 123r the company determined the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model 

sfas 123r requires the company to recognize compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest rather than record forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods for the year ended december 31 2006 compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was 408 million of which 102 million was related to grants made in 2006 a onepercentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a 04 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for the year ended december 31 2006 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 155 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments—an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140 “sfas 155” 

  

sfas 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after september 15 2006 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 155 to have a material impact on its financial statements 

in march 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 156 accounting for servicing of financial assets—an amendment of fasb statement no 140 “sfas 156” sfas 156 provides some relief for entities that use derivatives to economically hedge fluctuations in the fair value of their servicing rights and changes how gains and losses are computed in certain transfers or securitizations sfas 156 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after september 15 2006 adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial statements 

in june 2006 the fasb ratified emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 063 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation  this standard allows companies to present in their statements of operations any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenueproducing transactions between a seller and a customer such as sales use valueadded and some excise taxes on either a gross included in revenues and costs or a net excluded from revenues basis this standard will be effective for the company in interim periods and fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the company presents these transactions on a net basis and intends to continue this presentation in the future therefore the adoption of this standard will have no impact on its financial statements 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 fin 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize measure present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return the company does not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material impact on its financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements sfas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 earlier adoption is permitted provided the company has not yet issued financial statements including for interim periods for that fiscal year the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 157 to have a material impact on its financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb ratified eitf issue no 064 accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement splitdollar life insurance arrangements “eitf 064” eitf 064 indicates that an employer should recognize a liability for future postemployment benefits based on the substantive agreement with the employee and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 the company will adopt eitf 064 as required and does not expect a material impact on its financial statements 

in september 2006 the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue 065 accounting for purchases of life insurancedetermining the amount that could be realized in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 854 “eitf 065” eitf 065 requires that a policyholder should consider any additional amounts included in the contractual terms of the policy in determining the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract on a policy by policy basis eitf 065 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and it requires that recognition of the effects of adoption should be either by a a change in accounting principle through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or b a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods the company does not expect the adoption of eitf 065 to have a material impact on its financial statements 

  

results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2006 

temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were 31 billion 26 billion and 22 billion for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively increasing by 19 and 21 in 2006 and 2005 respectively permanent placement revenues were 336 million 219 million and 136 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively increasing by 53 and 61 in 2006 and 2005 respectively improvement in the us labor markets contributed to the increase in temporary and permanent staffing services revenues for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were 543 million 479 million and 352 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively increasing by 13 and 36 in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2006 increase in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to higher international revenues particularly in asia the 2005 increase in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to increased brand acceptance in the marketplace and expanding demand related to increased focus on internal accounting controls and other corporate governance requirements including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 there can be no assurances that there will be ongoing demand for sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance services or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results we expect total company revenues to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2007 

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 350 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and 17 foreign countries while protiviti has more than 55 offices in 22 states and 14 foreign countries revenues from foreign operations represented 21 19 and 18 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

gross margin dollars from the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services which consist of payroll payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services are equal to revenues as there are no direct costs associated with such revenues gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services which consist primarily of professional staff payroll payroll taxes insurance costs and reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services were 12 billion 963 million and 787 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively increasing by 20 and 22 in 2006 and 2005 respectively gross margin amounts equaled 37 36 and 36 of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the higher 2006 temporary and consultant gross margin percentage is primarily the result of higher bill rates and conversion revenues conversion revenues are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position as there are no direct costs related to conversion revenues the gross margin percentage is favorably impacted as the mix of conversion revenues increases in the year ended december 31 2006 the composition of temporary revenues included higher conversion revenues as compared to 2005 

gross margin dollars for the company’s permanent placement staffing division were 336 million 219 million and 136 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively increasing by 53 and 61 in 2006 and 2005 respectively gross margin dollars for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit division were 199 million 190 million and 133 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively increasing by 5 and 43 in 2006 and 2005 respectively gross margin amounts equaled 37 40 and 38 of revenues for risk consulting and internal audit services for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the 2006 decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily the result of additional professional staff related to the expansion of international operations as well as lower utilization of the professional staff in the united states the 2005 improvement in risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin dollars is primarily the result of higher revenues and improved staff utilization 

selling general and administrative expenses were 12 billion in 2006 compared to 991 million in 2005 and 824 million in 2004 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 31 30 and 31 for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively selling general and 

  

administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation advertising depreciation and occupancy costs the expensing of stock options the higher mix of permanent placement activities and the continuing additions to professional staff all contributed to the higher percentage of 2006 selling general and administrative expenses the lower 2005 selling general and administrative expense percentage resulted primarily from leveraging fixed operating costs 

for acquisitions the company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets if any and then to goodwill identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives typically ranging from two to five years goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required net intangible assets consisting primarily of goodwill represented 12 of total assets and 17 of total stockholders’ equity at december 31 2006 

interest income for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 was 193 million 121 million and 50 million respectively while interest expense for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 was 25 million 11 million and 12 million respectively higher average cash balances in 2006 and 2005 and higher interest rates during those years yielded higher interest income 

the provision for income taxes was 39 39 and 40 of income before taxes for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in 2005 is due primarily to the diminishing impact of permanent nondeductible tax items which became increasingly less significant relative to the company’s improved financial results and to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in certain states and international locations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

competition 

  

the company’s staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates the staffing business is highly competitive with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the company on a national regional or local basis in many areas the local companies are the strongest competitors the most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel 

  

the company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience with and commitment to the specialized employment market its national presence and its various marketing activities 

  

protiviti faces competition in its efforts to attract clients and win proposal presentations the risk consulting and internal audit businesses are highly competitive due to many new firms entering the market and the evolution of established firms in the business space in addition the changing regulatory environment is increasing opportunities for nonattestation audit and risk consulting services the principal competitors of protiviti remain the “big four” accounting firms significant competitive factors include reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel protiviti believes its competitive strengths lie in its unique ability to couple the deep skills and proven methodologies of its “big four” heritage with the customer focus and attention of a smaller organization

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business the most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows 

  

business highly dependent upon the state of the economy the demand for the company’s services in particular its staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company’s clients any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the us or of any of the foreign countries in which the company does business or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the company’s revenues and profits 

  

availability of candidates the company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment there can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the company candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources including the company and its competitors any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the company 

  

highly competitive business the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

  

reputation  the success of the company’s staffing and protiviti businesses is highly dependent upon their reputations any event that adversely impacts the reputation of either business could materially adversely affect the company 

  

potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination or harassment while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

  

dependence upon personnel the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

  

government regulation the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or 

  

approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company 

  

government regulation of the workplace the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company 

  

demand for services the operations of both the staffing services business and protiviti include services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services 

  

reliance on shortterm contracts because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

  

the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class action lawsuits alleging various wage and hour claims that could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  the company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour matters the company and certain subsidiaries are currently defendants in two class action lawsuits in california and one class action lawsuit in massachusetts all three lawsuits allege among other things the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under federal and state law and other related wage and hour violations and seek an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime compensation statutory penalties and other damages as well as attorneys’ fees it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits however these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits in addition the company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in other jurisdictions an unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could individually or in the aggregate cause the company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

protiviti dependence on personnel protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

  

protiviti competition protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

  

potential liability the business of protiviti consists of providing internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

  

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required estimates used in determining the accounts receivable allowances were based on current trends and historical loss statistics actual results may differ from these estimates which may materially affect the company’s future financial results 

  

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding deferred income tax assets and liabilities are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

  

employee retirement plans the determination of the company’s obligations for its defined benefit retirement agreement for the company’s chief executive officer is dependent upon various assumptions including among others expected retirement age mortality expected post retirement consumer price index increases and discount rates management believes its assumptions are appropriate however significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future financial results 

  

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of cash flow is based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management the company’s estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial results of the company the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required 

  

workers’ compensation the company selfinsures or retains a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers’ compensation the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic third party actuarial valuations while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future financial results 

  

stock option plans the company has a long history of issuing stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of its compensation programs accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans the company has chosen to account for its stock option plans under accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees “apb 25” under apb 25 the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and as a result no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the financial statements restricted stock and stock unit grants are accounted for in accordance with apb 25 apb 25 mandates that restricted stock grants with performance conditions are calculated using the intrinsic value as required by statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure  calculations of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share computed in accordance with the method prescribed by sfas no 123 sharebased payment “sfas 123” are set forth in note a to the financial statements 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2005 the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued issue no 056 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements “eitf 056” which requires that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of a lease term be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased the adoption of eitf 056 during the three months ended september 30 2005 did not have an impact on the company’s financial statements 

  

in march 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 “fin 47” which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated the company adopted the provisions of fin 47 in the three months ended december 31 2005 the adoption of fin 47 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections—a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3 “sfas 154” sfas 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle sfas 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable apb opinion no 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle the provisions in sfas 154 are effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 accordingly the company will adopt sfas 154 effective january 1 2006 the adoption of sfas 154 is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

during december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” which revises sfas 123 and supersedes apb 25 sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized as expense based on their fair values in april 2005 the sec amended the effective date of sfas 123r to be the first annual period beginning after june 15 2005 the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas 123 will no longer be an alternative to expense recognition under sfas 123r the company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the blackscholes model the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas 123r in the first quarter of 2006 the company is in the process of assessing the impact on the company’s results of operations from the adoption of sfas 123r for its effect on prospective option grants the adoption of sfas 123r requires the company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of sfas 123r under the fair value method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock option’s remaining vesting period this will result in the company expensing approximately 17 million before income tax effects in 2006 that would previously have been presented in a pro forma footnote disclosure in addition sfas 123r will require the company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow which will impact the company’s future reported cash flow from operating activities

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 330 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and twelve foreign countries while protiviti has more than 45 offices in 22 states and ten foreign countries revenues from foreign operations represented 19 18 and 18 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

gross margin dollars from the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services which consist of payroll payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services are equal to revenues as there are no direct costs associated with such revenues gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services which consist primarily of professional staff payroll payroll taxes insurance costs and reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services were 963 million 787 million and 610 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively increasing by 22 and 29 in 2005 and 2004 respectively gross margin amounts equaled 36 36 and 35 of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the higher 2004 temporary and consultant gross margin percentage is primarily the result of higher bill rates and conversion revenues gross margin dollars for the company’s permanent placement staffing division were 219 million 136 million and 95 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively increasing by 61 and 43 in 2005 and 2004 respectively gross margin dollars for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit division were 190 million 133 million and 22 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively gross margin amounts equaled 40 38 and 16 of revenues for risk consulting and internal audit services for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the 2005 and 2004 improvements in risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin dollars is primarily the result of higher revenues and improved staff utilization 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were 991 million in 2005 compared to 824 million in 2004 and 707 million in 2003 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 30 31 and 36 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation advertising depreciation and occupancy costs the lower 2005 and 2004 selling general and administrative expense percentages resulted primarily from leveraging fixed operating costs 

  

for acquisitions the company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets if any and then to goodwill identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives typically ranging from two to five years goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during each of the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required net intangible assets consisting primarily of goodwill represented 13 of total assets and 17 of total stockholders’ equity at december 31 2005

the provision for income taxes was 39 40 and 45 of income before taxes for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the decreases in 2005 and 2004 are due primarily to the diminishing impact of permanent nondeductible tax items which became increasingly less significant relative to the company’s improved financial results and to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in certain states and international locations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the change in the company’s liquidity during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and principal payments on outstanding notes payable

highly competitive business the staffing services business is highly competitive and because it is a service business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than the company and new competitors are entering the market all the time in addition longterm contracts form a negligible portion of the company’s revenue therefore there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that the company will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or if profitable maintain its current profit margins 

  

reputation  the success of the company’s staffing and protiviti businesses is highly dependent upon their reputations any event that adversely impacts the reputation of either business could materially adversely affect the company 

  

potential liability to employees and clients the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces the company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited as the employer of record of its temporary employees the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events including claims of physical injury discrimination or harassment while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the company the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors omissions or theft by its temporary employees the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company’s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 

  

dependence upon personnel the company is engaged in the services business as such its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets of which the company has few there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success 

  

government regulation the company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or 

  

approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the company 

  

government regulation of the workplace the company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employeremployee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially adversely affect the company 

  

reliance on shortterm contracts because longterm contracts are not a significant part of the company’s staffing services business future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 

  

protiviti operations protiviti began operations in 2002 it has only recently generated an operating profit and there can be no assurance that the business will remain profitable in the future 

  

protiviti dependence on personnel protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel while protiviti has retained its key personnel to date there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 

  

protiviti competition protiviti operates in a highly competitive business as with the company’s staffing services business the barriers to entry are quite low there are many competitors some of which have greater resources than protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than protiviti  in particular protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation technology tools project methodologies price of services and depth of skills of personnel there can be no assurance that protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients 

  

demand for services in 2002 2003 and 2004 the operations of protiviti included services related to sarbanesoxley and other regulatory compliance there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services 

  

potential liability the business of protiviti consists of providing internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the company or protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities there can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on protiviti or the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

as described below the company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 

  

accounts receivable allowances the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required estimates used in determining the accounts receivable allowances were based on current trends and historical loss statistics actual results may differ from these estimates which may materially affect the company’s future financial results 

  

income tax assets and liabilities in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding deferred income tax assets and liabilities are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 

  

employee retirement plans the determination of the company’s obligations for certain employee retirement plans is dependent upon various assumptions including among others expected retirement age mortality expected post retirement consumer price index increases and discount rates management believes its assumptions are appropriate however significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future financial results 

  

goodwill impairment the company assesses the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis the estimate of cash flow is based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management the company’s estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial results of the company the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required 

  

workers’ compensation the company selfinsures or retains a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers’ compensation the company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic third party actuarial valuations while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company’s future financial results 

  

stock option plans the company has a long history of issuing stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of its compensation programs accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans the company has chosen to account for its stock option plans under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees “apb 25” under apb 25 the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and as a result no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the consolidated financial statements “financial statements” restricted stock grants are accounted for in accordance with apb 25 which mandates that restricted stock grants with performance conditions are calculated using the intrinsic value as required by statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure “sfas 148” calculations of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share computed in accordance with the method prescribed by sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas 123” are set forth in note a to the financial statements 

  

the company expects to adopt the provisions of sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  “sfas 123r” on july 1 2005 among other things sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june 15 2005 see note b—new accounting pronouncements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

  

results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2004 

  

temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were 22 billion 17 billion and 18 billion for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively increasing by 25 in 2004 and decreasing by 1 in 2003 permanent placement revenues were 136 million 95 million and 100 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively increasing by 43 in 2004 and decreasing by 5 in 2003 improvement in the us labor markets contributed to the increase in temporary and permanent staffing services revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 staffing services revenue results for the year ended december 31 2003 were adversely impacted by weak labor markets and soft general economic conditions particularly in 

  

the united states risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were 352 million and 133 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively and 42 million for the period may 24 2002 inception to december 31 2002 the 2004 and 2003 increases in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to increased brand acceptance in the marketplace and expanding demand related to increased focus on internal accounting controls and other corporate governance requirements including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 there can be no assurances that there will be ongoing demand for sarbanesoxley or other regulatory compliance services or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results we expect total company revenues to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2005 

  

the company’s temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 330 offices in 42 states the district of columbia and ten foreign countries while protiviti has more than 35 offices in 20 states and eight foreign countries revenues from domestic operations represented 82 82 and 83 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively revenues from foreign operations represented 18 18 and 17 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

gross margin dollars from the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services which consist of payroll payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services are equal to revenues as there are no direct costs associated with such revenues gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services which consist primarily of professional staff payroll payroll taxes insurance costs and reimbursable expenses gross margin dollars for the company’s temporary and consultant staffing services were 787 million 610 million and 628 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively increasing by 29 in 2004 and decreasing by 3 in 2003 gross margin amounts equaled 36 35 and 36 of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the higher 2004 temporary and consultant gross margin percentage is primarily the result of higher bill rates and conversion revenues the lower 2003 temporary and consultant gross margin percentage is primarily the result of higher workers’ compensation and state unemployment costs gross margin dollars for the company’s permanent placement staffing division were 136 million 95 million and 100 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively increasing by 43 in 2004 and decreasing by 5 in 2003 gross margin dollars for the company’s risk consulting and internal audit division were 133 million and 22 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively and negative 13 million for the period may 24 2002 inception to december 31 2002 the 2004 and 2003 improvements in risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin dollars is primarily the result of higher revenues and improved staff utilization 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were 824 million in 2004 compared to 707 million in 2003 and 710 million in 2002 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 31 36 and 37 for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation advertising depreciation and occupancy costs the lower 2004 and 2003 selling general and administrative expense percentages resulted primarily from leveraging fixed operating costs 

  

for acquisitions the company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets if any and then to goodwill the company adopted sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” on january 1 2002 resulting in the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill that was being amortized over 40 years the methods used for evaluating and measuring impairment of certain intangible assets have changed in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during each of the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required net intangible assets consisting primarily of goodwill represented 14 of total assets and 18 of total stockholders’ equity at december 31 2004 

  

interest income for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 was 50 million 34 million and 55 million respectively while interest expense for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 was 12 million 08 million and 09 million respectively higher average cash balances in 2004 and higher interest rates during the year yielded higher interest income lower average cash balances in 2003 and lower interest rates during that year yielded lower interest income 

  

the provision for income taxes was 40 45 and 38 of income before taxes for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the decrease in 2004 is due primarily to the diminishing impact of permanent nondeductible tax items which became increasingly less significant relative to the company’s improved financial results and to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in certain states and international locations the increase in 2003 is due primarily to losses in certain states and international locations where corresponding tax benefits are not being recognized 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the change in the company’s liquidity during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and principal payments on outstanding notes payable
