the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the companys core source of value creation the itw business model is the companys competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders it is comprised of three unique elements 

• itws 8020 fronttoback process is the operating system that is applied in every itw business initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s itw has continually refined improved and expanded 8020 into a proprietary holistic business management process that generates significant value for the company and its customers through the application of data driven insights generated by 8020 practice itw focuses on its largest and best opportunities the 80 and eliminates cost complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities the 20 8020 enables itw businesses to consistently achieve worldclass operational excellence in product availability quality and innovation while generating superior financial performance 

• customerback innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at itw the companys unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 8020 fronttoback process working from the customer back itw businesses position themselves as the goto problem solver for their 80 customers itws innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs particularly those in 80 markets with solid longterm growth fundamentals and creating unique solutions to address those needs these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 19300 granted and pending patents 

• itws decentralized entrepreneurial culture enables itw businesses to be fast focused and responsive itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers needs itw colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the companys strategy and values as a result the company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that combined with outstanding execution delivers bestinclass services and solutions adapted to each business customers and end markets 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

• the first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of itws business portfolio as part of the portfolio management initiative itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a musthave requirement for all itw businesses this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions 

as a result of this work itws business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses largest  most profitable customers and product lines 

• step two business structure simplification was implemented to simplify and scale up itws operating structure to support increased engineering marketing and sales resources and improve global reach and competitiveness all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth itw now has 83 scaledup divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments core customers and products and customerback innovation 

• the strategic sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at itw delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2021 and continues to be a key contributor to the companys ongoing enterprise strategy 

• with the initial portfolio realignment and scaleup work largely complete the company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth reapplying the 8020 fronttoback process to optimize its newly scaledup divisions for growth first to build a foundation of operational excellence and second to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth 

itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the companys operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital at the same time these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

path to full potential 

since the launch of the enterprise strategy the company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage but for the company to truly reach its full potential every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential to do so the company remains focused on its core principles to position itw to perform to its full potential 

• portfolio discipline 

• 8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

• fullpotential organic growth 

portfolio discipline 

the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant longterm competitive advantage from the itw business model itw businesses have the right raw material in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive abovemarket organic growth over the longterm 

the company focuses on highquality businesses ensuring it operates in markets with positive longterm macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itws differentiated products services and solutions itws portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments 

the company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent longterm performance this includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective highquality acquisitions to supplement itws longterm growth potential 

the company previously communicated its intent to explore options including potential divestitures for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to 1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company completed the divestitures of three businesses and continues to evaluate options for certain other businesses however due to the covid19 pandemic the company deferred any further significant divestiture activity until 2022 or later the company intends to reinitiate the divestiture process in 2022 for certain businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately 05 billion refer to note 4 divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding divestiture activity 

8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

the 8020 fronttoback process is a rigorous iterative and highly datadriven approach to identify where the company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable highquality organic growth the company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities markets customers and products 

itw will continue to drive 8020 fronttoback practice excellence in every division in the company every day driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 8020 fronttoback practice across the company division by division will produce further customerfacing performance improvement in a number of divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level 

nearterm priorities 

while it was the challenges brought about by the covid19 pandemic that dominated the companys attention starting in 2020 it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that have been built and honed over the past nine years through the execution of itws enterprise strategy that provided the company with the options to respond this coupled with the proprietary and powerful itw business model diversified highquality business portfolio and diligent execution put the company in a position of strength in dealing with the global pandemic 

as the global pandemic continues the company continues to focus its efforts on 1 protecting the health and support the wellbeing of itws colleagues 2 serving the companys customers with excellence 3 maintain financial strength liquidity and strategic optionality and 4 leverage the companys strengths to position it to fully participate in the recovery 

win the recovery is an execution component of the companys enterprise strategy not a separate initiative with every one of the companys divisions identifying specific opportunities presented by the pandemic to capture sustainable share gains that are aligned with the itw longterm enterprise strategy the company expects these efforts to contribute meaningfully to accelerate its progress toward fullpotential organic growth the company continues to focus on delivering strong results in any environment while executing its longterm strategy to achieve and sustain itws full potential performance 

fullpotential organic growth 

reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable highquality organic growth the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve fullpotential organic growth in every division with specific focus on 

• 80 focused market penetration  fully leveraging the considerable growth potential that resides in the companys largest and most differentiated product offerings and customer relationships 

• customerback innovation  strengthening the companys commitment to serial innovation and delivering a continuous flow of differentiated new products to its key customers 

• strategic sales excellence  deploying a highperformance sales function in every division 

as the company continues to make progress toward its full potential the company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the longterm organic growth potential of itw through the addition of selective highquality acquisitions such as the acquisition of the test  simulation business of mts systems corporation mts from amphenol corporation on december 1 2021 the operating results of the mts test  simulation business were reported within the companys test  measurement and electronics segment refer to note 3 acquisitions in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding this acquisition 

current year developments 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

distribution methods 

the companys businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors 

backlog 

backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the companys businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of their products total backlog was 29 billion and 16 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in backlog as of december 31 2021 was primarily due to increased customer orders and the global supply chain disruptions impacting the companys customers and the acquisition of the mts test  simulation business refer to note 3 acquisitions in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding this acquisition due to the predominately shortterm nature of the companys arrangements with its customers backlog orders expected to be completed beyond calendar year 2022 are not significant and represent approximately 5 of total backlog as of december 31 2021 

competition 

with operations in 52 countries the company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets many of which are fragmented and the company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line end market and geographic area the companys competitors include many regional or specialized companies as well as large us and nonus companies or divisions of large companies each of the companys segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas in addition to numerous smaller regional competitors the welding segment competes globally with lincoln electric and esab 

in virtually all segments the company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation product quality brand preference and service delivery technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments the company believes that each segments primary competitive advantages derive from the itw business model and decentralized operating structure which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics this structure enables the companys businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the companys 8020 fronttoback process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities the company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets especially in its automotive oem segment

in addition to patents many of the companys products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks which are important to the company in the aggregate some of the companys more significant trademarks include itw which is also used in conjunction with the trademarks of many of the companys businesses deltar and shakeproof in the automotive oem segment hobart in the food equipment segment instron and mts in the test  measurement and electronics segment miller in the welding segment rainx and permatex in the polymers  fluids segment paslode in the construction products segment and hicone in the specialty products segment 

government regulations 

the company believes that its businesses and operations including its manufacturing plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations including those related to environmental consumer protection international trade labor and employment human rights tax antibribery and competition matters any additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the companys capital expenditures including expenditures for environmental control facilities competitive position financial position or results of operations 

various legislative and administrative regulations applicable to the company in the matters noted above have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world to date such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the companys revenues earnings or cash flows however if new or amended laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products the companys business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted refer to item 1a risk factors for further information

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

economic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected the companys business financial condition and results of operations and could affect the companys liquidity the full and longterm extent of the effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business depend on future events that continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

the covid19 pandemic and the continued measures taken globally to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy disrupted consumercustomer demand and global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets these measures and the continued volatility of the global economy adversely affected our results of operations for 2020 and while most of our segments achieved strong results in 2021 we are currently unable to quantify the full and longterm impact of the pandemic on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

the company has implemented numerous actions in order to focus on the needs of its colleagues and customers such as redesigning production processes adjusting shift schedules and assignments and implementing aggressive new workplace sanitation practices and a coordinated response to ensure access to personal protective equipment to minimize infection risk further actions may be required in response to evolving conditions such as renewed travel restrictions quarantine and stayathome orders as well as uncertainty regarding the emergence of new variants and the timing of widespread availability of testing vaccines and treatments we cannot predict whether there will be pandemicrelated facility closures in the future 

the covid19 pandemic continues to have the potential to significantly and extendedly alter demand for our products and to disrupt our supply chain as a result of shifts in demand illness quarantine travel restrictions transportation disruptions increased border controls or closures or financial hardship we have been able to procure the critical raw materials and components necessary to continue production but prices for some raw materials have increased significantly and there is no guarantee that we will be able to procure critical raw materials in the future without materially adversely impacting our operating margins a prolonged extension of the conditions resulting from the pandemic could force both customer and supplier bankruptcies which we expect would adversely impact our results however given the uncertainty around the continued duration and breadth of the covid19 pandemic we cannot reasonably estimate the extent of these adverse effects on our operations 

the company has sought to implement a differentiated strategy to manage through the pandemic including a focus on thoughtful cost management and continued investment in areas of strategic importance in order to maintain optionality and fully participate in the recovery phase although some opportunities have already emerged from this strategy the company cannot estimate the extent or the timing of the benefits from this strategy if any if the companys strategy does not generate the expected benefits the companys longterm financial results could be adversely impacted 

furthermore the covid19 pandemic has the potential to impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets if the economic recovery is protracted we may not be able to access our shortterm credit facilities and may be required to seek additional financing sources which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all if the company suffers a liquidity shortage we may be forced to reduce our workforce decrease or suspend dividend payments or share repurchases or adopt other measures we cannot predict the likelihood timing or the consequences of a future liquidity shortage in our business 

the ultimate significance of the covid19 pandemic on our business will depend on events that are beyond our control and that we cannot predict additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the companys results are impacted by global economic conditions downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses results of operations or financial condition 

the companys businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe slower economic growth financial market instability inflation natural disasters public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic labor market challenges supply chain disruptions government deficit reduction sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the 

markets the company serves can adversely affect the companys businesses by reducing demand for the companys products and services limiting financing available to the companys customers causing production delays increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable increasing price competition or increasing the risk that counterparties to the companys contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations 

the global nature of the companys operations subjects it to political economic and social risks that could adversely affect its business results of operations or financial condition 

over 50 of the companys net sales are derived from customers outside the united states and the company currently operates in 52 countries the risks inherent in the companys global operations include 

• fluctuation in currency exchange rates 

• limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises 

• price controls exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings 

• transportation delays and disruptions 

• political social and economic instability and disruptions 

• acts of terrorism 

• the impact of widespread public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic 

• government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions 

• the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures 

• government actions impacting international trade agreements including the euuk trade and cooperation agreement 

• import and export controls 

• social and labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

• the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises 

• difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations 

• multiple and potentially conflicting laws regulations and policies that are subject to change 

• limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies and 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

the global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies further changes in us trade policy including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs and retaliatory actions by us trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the companys business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the companys operating income 

although the companys financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the companys profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values and in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition 

business and operational risks 

the benefits from the companys enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the companys financial results could be adversely impacted or the company may not meet its longterm financial performance targets 

as the company continues to execute on its enterprise strategy initiatives it remains focused on the core principles of portfolio discipline 8020 fronttoback practice excellence and organic growth product line and customer base simplification activities which are core elements of the companys 8020 fronttoback process continue to be applied by the companys operating divisions and are active elements of the enterprise strategy although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth they are also expected to have a negative impact on the companys overall organic revenue growth in the short term additionally other core activities of the enterprise strategy related to portfolio discipline and organic growth including customerback innovation and strategic sales excellence may not 

have the desired impact on future operating results if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives the companys financial results could be adversely impacted or the company may not meet its longterm financial performance targets 

the timing and amount of the companys share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties 

share repurchases constitute a significant component of the companys capital allocation strategy the company has historically funded its share repurchases with free cash flow and shortterm borrowings the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause the company to limit suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions the price of the companys common stock the nature of other investment opportunities presented to the company from time to time regulatory developments relating to share repurchase programs the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of us cash 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products its future growth may be adversely affected 

the companys ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources difficulties or delays in research development production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the companys competitive position if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation its organic growth may be adversely affected 

if the company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

protecting the companys intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks andor other intellectual property rights related to many of its products and also has exclusive and nonexclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others the companys intellectual property rights may be challenged or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the companys intellectual property rights by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the companys competitive position and results of operations 

the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial results 

the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions including the acquisition of the mts test  simulation business in 2021 a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets including significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets impairment charges could adversely affect the companys financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing the company has experienced supply chain disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic and continued disruptions to the supply chain could adversely affect the companys ability to meet commitments to customers prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and the company is currently experiencing upward pricing pressure on raw materials such as steel resins and chemicals significant price increases could adversely affect the companys results of operations and operating margins in particular inflation changes in trade policies the imposition of duties and tariffs potential retaliatory countermeasures public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic and severe weather events could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the companys defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches or if there is a violation of data privacy laws there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage 

the company relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures computer viruses employee error or malfeasance and attacks by computer hackers which have continued to increase on a global scale in both magnitude and frequency taken on novel and unprecedented forms and become more difficult to detect minor security breaches have occurred from time to time and are expected to occur in the future although the cyberattacks experienced to date have not had a material impact future security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could cause reputational and legal harm as we are subject to data privacy laws including the eu general data protection regulation in the various countries in which we operate if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner or if we violate data privacy laws there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage 

strategic transaction risks 

the companys acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns 

the company has engaged in various acquisitions in the past such as the recently completed acquisition of the mts test  simulation business and could choose to acquire additional businesses in the future acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial accounting managerial and operational challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect the companys profitability and returns 

• the acquired business inability to adapt to the itw business model or otherwise perform in accordance with the companys anticipated results or timetable could cause it to underperform relative to the companys expectations and the price paid for it 

• the acquired business could cause the companys financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period or over the long term 

• acquisitionrelated earnings charges could adversely impact operating results

the companys operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments automotive oem food equipment test  measurement and electronics welding polymers  fluids construction products and specialty products 

due to the large number of diverse businesses and the companys decentralized operating structure the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results instead the companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements operating revenue operating income operating margin overhead costs number of months on hand in inventory days sales outstanding in accounts receivable past due receivables and return on invested capital these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management 

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the companys core source of value creation the itw business model is the companys competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders it is comprised of three unique elements 

• itws 8020 fronttoback process is the operating system that is applied in every itw business initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s itw has continually refined improved and expanded 8020 into a proprietary holistic business management process that generates significant value for the company and its customers through the application of data driven insights generated by 8020 practice itw focuses on its largest and best opportunities the 80 and eliminates cost complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities the 20 8020 enables itw businesses to consistently achieve worldclass operational excellence in product availability quality and innovation while generating superior financial performance 

• customerback innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at itw the companys unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 8020 fronttoback process working from the customer back itw businesses position themselves as the goto problem solver for their 80 customers itws innovation efforts are 

focused on understanding customer needs particularly those in 80 markets with solid longterm growth fundamentals and creating unique solutions to address those needs these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 19300 granted and pending patents 

• itws decentralized entrepreneurial culture enables itw businesses to be fast focused and responsive itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers needs itw colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the companys strategy and values as a result the company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that combined with outstanding execution delivers bestinclass services and solutions adapted to each business customers and end markets 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

• the first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of itws business portfolio as part of the portfolio management initiative itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a musthave requirement for all itw businesses this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions 

as a result of this work itws business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses largest  most profitable customers and product lines 

• step two business structure simplification was implemented to simplify and scale up itws operating structure to support increased engineering marketing and sales resources and improve global reach and competitiveness all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth itw now has 83 scaledup divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments core customers and products and customerback innovation 

• the strategic sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at itw delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2021 and continues to be a key contributor to the companys ongoing enterprise strategy 

• with the initial portfolio realignment and scaleup work largely complete the company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth reapplying the 8020 fronttoback process to optimize its newly scaledup divisions for growth first to build a foundation of operational excellence and second to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth 

itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the companys operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital at the same time these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

path to full potential 

since the launch of the enterprise strategy the company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage 

but for the company to truly reach its full potential every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential to do so the company remains focused on its core principles to position itw to perform to its full potential 

• portfolio discipline 

• 8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

• fullpotential organic growth 

portfolio discipline 

the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant longterm competitive advantage from the itw business model itw businesses have the right raw material in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive abovemarket organic growth over the longterm 

the company focuses on highquality businesses ensuring it operates in markets with positive longterm macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itws differentiated products services and solutions itws portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments 

the company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent longterm performance this includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective highquality acquisitions to supplement itws longterm growth potential 

the company previously communicated its intent to explore options including potential divestitures for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to 1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company completed the divestitures of three businesses and continues to evaluate options for certain other businesses however due to the covid19 pandemic the company deferred any further significant divestiture activity until 2022 or later the company intends to reinitiate the divestiture process in 2022 for certain businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately 05 billion refer to note 4 divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding divestiture activity 

8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

the 8020 fronttoback process is a rigorous iterative and highly datadriven approach to identify where the company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable highquality organic growth the company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities markets customers and products 

itw will continue to drive 8020 fronttoback practice excellence in every division in the company every day driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 8020 fronttoback practice across the company division by division will produce further customerfacing performance improvement in a number of divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level 

nearterm priorities 

while it was the challenges brought about by the covid19 pandemic that dominated the companys attention starting in 2020 it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that have been built and honed over the past nine years through the execution of itws enterprise strategy that provided the company with the options to respond this coupled with the proprietary and powerful itw business model diversified highquality business portfolio and diligent execution put the company in a position of strength in dealing with the global pandemic 

as the global pandemic continues the company continues to focus its efforts on 1 protecting the health and support the wellbeing of itws colleagues 2 serving the companys customers with excellence 3 maintain financial strength liquidity and strategic optionality and 4 leverage the companys strengths to position it to fully participate in the recovery 

win the recovery is an execution component of the companys enterprise strategy not a separate initiative with every one of the companys divisions identifying specific opportunities presented by the pandemic to capture sustainable share gains that are aligned with the itw longterm enterprise strategy the company expects these efforts to contribute meaningfully to 

accelerate its progress toward fullpotential organic growth the company continues to focus on delivering strong results in any environment while executing its longterm strategy to achieve and sustain itws full potential performance 

fullpotential organic growth 

reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable highquality organic growth the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve fullpotential organic growth in every division with specific focus on

critical accounting estimates 

the company has three accounting estimates that it believes are most important to the companys financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and in some cases on observable market information various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the companys critical accounting estimates are as follows 

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the companys deferred and other tax balances are based on managements interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the companys various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected 

levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets — the companys business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the companys total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the difference in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2021 the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately 59 billion allocated to its reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the companys 8020 fronttoback process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 222 million to 14 billion with the average amount equal to 588 million fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the companys global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participants years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 12 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 37 million the company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weightedaverage rate see note 12 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 4 million

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the companys core source of value creation the itw business model is the companys competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders it is comprised of three unique elements 

• itws 8020 fronttoback process is the operating system that is applied in every itw business initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s itw has continually refined improved and expanded 8020 into a proprietary holistic business management process that generates significant value for the company and its customers through the application of data driven insights generated by 8020 practice itw focuses on its largest and best opportunities the 80 and eliminates cost complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities the 20 8020 enables itw businesses to consistently achieve worldclass operational excellence in product availability quality and innovation while generating superior financial performance 

• customerback innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at itw the companys unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 8020 fronttoback process working from the customer back itw businesses position themselves as the goto problem solver for their 80 customers itws innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs particularly those in 80 markets with solid longterm growth fundamentals and creating unique solutions to address those needs these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 18500 granted and pending patents 

• itws decentralized entrepreneurial culture enables itw businesses to be fast focused and responsive itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers needs itw colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the companys strategy and values as a result the company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that combined with outstanding execution delivers bestinclass services and solutions adapted to each business customers and end markets 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

• the first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of itws business portfolio as part of the portfolio management initiative itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a musthave requirement for all itw businesses this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions 

as a result of this work itws business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses largest  most profitable customers and product lines 

• step two business structure simplification was implemented to simplify and scale up itws operating structure to support increased engineering marketing and sales resources and improve global reach and competitiveness all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth itw now has 83 scaledup divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments core customers and products and customerback innovation 

• the strategic sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at itw delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2020 and continues to be a key contributor to the companys ongoing enterprise strategy 

• with the initial portfolio realignment and scaleup work largely complete the company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth reapplying the 8020 fronttoback process to optimize its newly scaledup divisions for growth first to build a foundation of operational excellence and second to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth 

itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the companys operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital at the same time these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

path to full potential 

since the launch of the enterprise strategy the company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage but for the company to truly finish the job and reach its full potential every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential to do so the company remains focused on its core principles to position itw to perform to its full potential 

• portfolio discipline 

• 8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

• fullpotential organic growth 

portfolio discipline 

the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant longterm competitive advantage from the itw business model itw businesses have the right raw material in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive abovemarket organic growth over the longterm 

the company focuses on highquality businesses ensuring it operates in markets with positive longterm macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itws differentiated products services and solutions itws portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments 

the company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent longterm performance this includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective highquality acquisitions to supplement itws longterm growth potential 

the company previously communicated its intent to explore options including potential divestitures for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to 1 billion the company expects any earnings per share dilution from divestitures would be offset by incremental share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company completed the divestitures of three businesses and continues to evaluate options for certain other businesses however due to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 the company has deferred any further significant divestiture activity until market conditions normalize refer to note 3 divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information regarding the companys divestitures 

8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

the 8020 fronttoback process is a rigorous iterative and highly datadriven approach to identify where the company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable highquality organic growth the company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities markets customers and products 

itw will continue to drive 8020 fronttoback practice excellence in every division in the company every day driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 8020 fronttoback practice across the company division by division will produce further customerfacing performance improvement in a number of the companys divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level 

nearterm priorities 

while it was the challenges brought about by the covid19 pandemic that dominated the companys attention in 2020 it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that have been built and honed over the past eight years through the execution of itws enterprise strategy that provided the company with the options to respond this coupled with the proprietary and powerful itw business model diversified highquality business portfolio and diligent execution put the company in a position of strength in dealing with the global pandemic 

from the early days of the pandemic the company focused its efforts on the following priorities 1 protect the health and support the wellbeing of itws colleagues 2 continue to serve the companys customers with excellence to the best of its ability 3 maintain financial strength liquidity and strategic optionality and 4 leverage the companys strengths to position it to fully participate in the recovery 

win the recovery is an execution component of the companys enterprise strategy not a separate initiative with every one of the companys divisions identifying specific opportunities presented by the pandemic to capture sustainable share gains that are aligned with the itw longterm enterprise strategy these efforts are just beginning to take hold and the company expects them to contribute meaningfully to accelerate its progress toward fullpotential organic growth the company continues to focus on delivering strong results in any environment while executing its longterm strategy to achieve and sustain itws full potential performance 

fullpotential organic growth 

reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable highquality organic growth the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve fullpotential organic growth in every division with specific focus on 

• 80 focused market penetration  fully leveraging the considerable growth potential that resides in the companys largest and most differentiated product offerings and customer relationships 

• customerback innovation  strengthening the companys commitment to serial innovation and delivering a continuous flow of differentiated new products to its key customers 

• strategic sales excellence  deploying a highperformance sales function in every division 

as the company continues to make progress toward its full potential the company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the longterm organic growth potential of itw through the addition of selective highquality acquisitions such as the recently announced agreement with amphenol corporation amphenol whereby the company will acquire the test  simulation business of mts systems corporation mts following the closing of amphenols acquisition of mts upon completion of this acquisition this business will be reported within the companys test  measurement and electronics segment 

current year developments 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

distribution methods 

the companys businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors 

backlog 

backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the companys businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of their products total backlog was 16 billion and 15 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively due to the predominately shortterm nature of the companys arrangements with its customers backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2021 were not material as of december 31 2020 

competition 

with operations in 52 countries the company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets many of which are fragmented and the company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line end market and geographic area the companys competitors include many regional or specialized companies as well as large us and nonus companies or divisions of large companies each of the companys segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas in addition to numerous smaller regional competitors the welding segment competes globally with lincoln electric and esab 

in virtually all segments the company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation product quality brand preference and service delivery technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments the company believes that each segments primary competitive advantages derive from the itw business model and decentralized operating structure which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics this structure enables the companys businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the companys 8020 fronttoback process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities the company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets especially in its automotive oem segment

the company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important however the expiration of any one of the companys patents would not have a material effect on the companys results of operations or financial position the company also credits its success in the markets it serves to engineering capability manufacturing techniques skills and efficiency marketing and sales promotion and service and delivery of quality products to its customers 

in addition to patents many of the companys products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks which are important to the company in the aggregate some of the companys more significant trademarks include itw which is also used in conjunction with the trademarks of many of the companys businesses deltar and shakeproof in the automotive oem segment hobart in the food equipment segment instron in the test  measurement and electronics segment miller in the welding segment rainx and permatex in the polymers  fluids segment paslode in the construction products segment and hicone in the specialty products segment 

government regulations 

the company believes that its businesses and operations including its manufacturing plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations including those related to environmental consumer protection international trade labor and employment human rights tax antibribery and competition matters any additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the companys capital expenditures including expenditures for environmental control facilities competitive position financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

economic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected the companys business financial condition and results of operations and could affect the companys liquidity the full and longterm extent of the effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business depend on future events that continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

the covid19 pandemic and the continued measures taken globally to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy disrupted consumercustomer demand and global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets these measures and the continued volatility of the global economy adversely affected our results of operations for 2020 and while we expect that our results will continue to be adversely impacted beyond 2020 we are currently unable to quantify the full and longterm impact of the pandemic on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

the company has implemented numerous actions in order to focus on the needs of its colleagues and customers such as redesigning production processes adjusting shift schedules and assignments and implementing aggressive new workplace sanitation practices and a coordinated response to ensure access to personal protective equipment to minimize infection risk further actions may be required in response to evolving conditions such as renewed travel restrictions quarantine and stayathome orders as well as uncertainty regarding the timing of widespread availability of a vaccine in addition because the pandemic has decreased customer demand in certain of our end markets some of our businesses are operating at reduced capacity we cannot predict when or whether these businesses will resume full operations or whether there will be related or unrelated facility closures in the future 

the covid19 pandemic continues to have the potential to significantly and extendedly alter demand for our products and to disrupt our supply chain as a result of shifts in demand illness quarantine travel restrictions or financial hardship we have been able to procure the critical raw materials and components necessary to continue production but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future a prolonged extension of the conditions resulting from the pandemic could force both customer and supplier bankruptcies which we expect would adversely impact our results however given the uncertainty around the continued duration and breadth of the covid19 pandemic we cannot reasonably estimate the extent of these adverse effects on our operations 

the company has sought to implement a differentiated strategy to manage through the pandemic including a focus on thoughtful cost management and continued investment in areas of strategic importance in order to maintain optionality and fully participate in the recovery phase although some opportunities have already emerged from this strategy the company cannot estimate the extent or the timing of the benefits from this strategy if any if the companys strategy does not generate the expected benefits the companys longterm financial results could be adversely impacted 

furthermore the covid19 pandemic has the potential to impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets if the economic recovery is protracted we may not be able to access our shortterm credit facilities and may be required to seek additional financing sources which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all if the company suffers a liquidity shortage we may be forced to reduce our workforce decrease or suspend dividend payments to our stockholders or adopt other measures we cannot predict the likelihood timing or the consequences of a future liquidity shortage in our business 

the ultimate significance of the covid19 pandemic on our business will depend on events that are beyond our control and that we cannot predict additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the companys results are impacted by global economic conditions downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses results of operations or financial condition 

the companys businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe slower economic growth financial market instability natural disasters public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic high unemployment government 

deficit reduction sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company’s businesses by reducing demand for the companys products and services limiting financing available to the companys customers causing production delays increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable increasing price competition or increasing the risk that counterparties to the companys contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations 

the global nature of the companys operations subjects it to political economic and social risks that could adversely affect its business results of operations or financial condition 

over 50 of the companys net sales are derived from customers outside the united states and the company currently operates in 52 countries the risks inherent in the companys global operations include 

• fluctuation in currency exchange rates 

• limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises 

• price controls exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings 

• transportation delays and interruptions 

• political social and economic instability and disruptions 

• acts of terrorism 

• the impact of widespread public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic 

• government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions 

• the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures 

• government actions impacting international trade agreements including the euuk trade and cooperation agreement 

• import and export controls 

• social and labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

• the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises 

• difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations 

• limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies and 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

the recent global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies further changes in us trade policy including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs and retaliatory actions by us trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the companys business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the companys operating income

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the companys core source of value creation the itw business model is the companys competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders it is comprised of three unique elements 

• itws 8020 fronttoback process is the operating system that is applied in every itw business initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s itw has continually refined improved and expanded 8020 into a proprietary holistic business management process that generates significant value for the company and its customers through the application of data driven insights generated by 8020 practice itw focuses on its largest and best opportunities the 80 and eliminates cost complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities the 20 8020 enables itw businesses to consistently achieve worldclass operational excellence in product availability quality and innovation while generating superior financial performance 

• customerback innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at itw the companys unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 8020 fronttoback process working from the customer back itw businesses position themselves as the goto problem solver for their 80 customers itws innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs particularly those in 80 markets with solid longterm growth fundamentals and creating unique solutions to address those needs these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 18500 granted and pending patents 

• itws decentralized entrepreneurial culture enables itw businesses to be fast focused and responsive itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers needs itw colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the companys strategy and values as a result the company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that combined with outstanding execution delivers bestinclass services and solutions adapted to each business customers and end markets 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

• the first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of itws business portfolio as part of the portfolio management initiative itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a musthave requirement for all itw businesses this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions 

as a result of this work itws business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses largest  most profitable customers and product lines 

• step two business structure simplification was implemented to simplify and scale up itws operating structure to support increased engineering marketing and sales resources and improve global reach and competitiveness all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth itw now has 83 scaledup divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments core customers and products and customerback innovation 

• the strategic sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at itw delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2020 and continues to be a key contributor to the companys ongoing enterprise strategy 

• with the initial portfolio realignment and scaleup work largely complete the company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth reapplying the 8020 fronttoback process to optimize its newly scaledup divisions for growth first to build a foundation of operational excellence and second to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth 

itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the companys operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital at the same time these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

path to full potential 

since the launch of the enterprise strategy the company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage but for the company to truly finish the job and reach its full potential every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential to do so the company remains focused on its core principles to position itw to perform to its full potential 

• portfolio discipline 

• 8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

• fullpotential organic growth 

portfolio discipline 

the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant longterm competitive advantage from the itw business model itw businesses have the right raw material in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive abovemarket organic growth over the longterm 

the company focuses on highquality businesses ensuring it operates in markets with positive longterm macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itws differentiated products services and solutions itws portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments 

the company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent longterm performance this includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective highquality acquisitions to supplement itws longterm growth potential 

the company previously communicated its intent to explore options including potential divestitures for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to 1 billion the company expects any earnings per share dilution from divestitures would be 

offset by incremental share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company completed the divestitures of three businesses and continues to evaluate options for certain other businesses however due to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 the company has deferred any further significant divestiture activity until market conditions normalize refer to note 3 divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information regarding the companys divestitures 

8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

the 8020 fronttoback process is a rigorous iterative and highly datadriven approach to identify where the company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable highquality organic growth the company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities markets customers and products 

itw will continue to drive 8020 fronttoback practice excellence in every division in the company every day driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 8020 fronttoback practice across the company division by division will produce further customerfacing performance improvement in a number of the companys divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level 

nearterm priorities 

while it was the challenges brought about by the covid19 pandemic that dominated the companys attention in 2020 it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that have been built and honed over the past eight years through the execution of itws enterprise strategy that provided the company with the options to respond this coupled with the proprietary and powerful itw business model diversified highquality business portfolio and diligent execution put the company in a position of strength in dealing with the global pandemic 

from the early days of the pandemic the company focused its efforts on the following priorities 1 protect the health and support the wellbeing of itws colleagues 2 continue to serve the companys customers with excellence to the best of its ability 3 maintain financial strength liquidity and strategic optionality and 4 leverage the companys strengths to position it to fully participate in the recovery 

win the recovery is an execution component of the companys enterprise strategy not a separate initiative with every one of the companys divisions identifying specific opportunities presented by the pandemic to capture sustainable share gains that are aligned with the itw longterm enterprise strategy these efforts are just beginning to take hold and the company expects them to contribute meaningfully to accelerate its progress toward fullpotential organic growth the company continues to focus on delivering strong results in any environment while executing its longterm strategy to achieve and sustain itws full potential performance 

fullpotential organic growth 

reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable highquality organic growth the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve fullpotential organic growth in every division with specific focus on 

• 80 focused market penetration  fully leveraging the considerable growth potential that resides in the companys largest and most differentiated product offerings and customer relationships 

• customerback innovation  strengthening the companys commitment to serial innovation and delivering a continuous flow of differentiated new products to its key customers 

• strategic sales excellence  deploying a highperformance sales function in every division 

as the company continues to make progress toward its full potential the company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the longterm organic growth potential of itw through the addition of selective highquality acquisitions such as the recently announced agreement with amphenol corporation amphenol whereby the company will acquire the test  simulation business of mts systems corporation mts following the closing of amphenols acquisition of mts upon completion of this acquisition this business will be reported within the companys test  measurement and electronics segment

consolidated results of operations 

in early 2020 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 occurred in china and other jurisdictions the covid19 outbreak was subsequently declared a global pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 2020 in response to the outbreak governments around the globe have taken various actions to reduce its spread including travel restrictions shutdowns of businesses deemed nonessential and stayathome or similar orders the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken globally to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy causing significant disruptions in the company’s global operations starting primarily in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020 as covid19 continued to spread and impact the countries in which the company operates and the markets the company serves 

the company delivered solid financial results in 2020 despite the extraordinary challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic as the company experienced solid recovery progress in many of its end markets in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 versus the second quarter the primary driver of the companys financial performance is the continued successful execution of enterprise initiatives and continued focus on the highly differentiated itw business model in 2020 despite the decline in operating revenue of 109 percent the company generated operating income of 29 billion operating margin was 229 percent free cash flow was 26 billion and aftertax return on average invested capital was 262 percent additionally all segments other than the food equipment automotive oem and welding segments which had more pronounced impacts from the covid19 pandemic had operating margins that improved compared to the prior year refer to the cash flow and aftertax return on average invested capital sections of liquidity and capital resources for a reconciliation of these nongaap measures 

for the duration of the covid19 pandemic the company is focusing on the following priorities 1 protect the health and support the wellbeing of itws colleagues 2 continue to serve the companys customers with excellence to the best of its ability 3 maintain financial strength liquidity and strategic optionality and 4 leverage the companys strengths to position it to fully participate in the recovery phase to support itws colleagues among its many actions and initiatives the company redesigned production processes to ensure proper social distancing practices adjusted shift schedules and assignments to help colleagues who have child and elder care needs and implemented aggressive new workplace sanitation practices and a coordinated response to ensure access to personal protective equipment to minimize infection risk to support its customers the company has worked diligently to keep its facilities open and operating safely the company has adapted customer service systems and practices to seamlessly serve its customers under “work from home” requirements in many parts of the world 

in areas around the world where governments issued stayathome or similar orders the vast majority of itws businesses were designated as critical or essential businesses and as such they remained open and operational in some cases this is because the companys products directly impact the covid19 response effort in other cases the companys businesses are designated as critical because they play a vital role in serving and supporting industries that are deemed essential to the physical and economic health of our communities 

while the vast majority of the companys facilities remained open and operational during the pandemic in 2020 many of these facilities were operating at a reduced capacity the full extent of the covid19 outbreak and its impact on the markets served by the company and on the companys operations and financial position continues to be highly uncertain a prolonged outbreak will continue to interrupt the operations of the company and its customers and suppliers a description of the risks relating to the impact of the covid19 outbreak on the companys business operations and financial condition is contained in part i item 1a risk factors

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the companys deferred and other tax balances are based on managements interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the companys various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets — the companys business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the companys total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its 

carrying value a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the difference in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2020 the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately 55 billion allocated to its reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the companys 8020 fronttoback process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 238 million to 11 billion with the average amount equal to 545 million fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the companys global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participants years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 11 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 40 million the company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weightedaverage rate see note 11 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 4 million

the information set forth below is applicable to all segments of the company unless otherwise noted 

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company’s core source of value creation the itw business model is the company’s competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders it is comprised of three unique elements 

 

 

 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

 

as a result of this work itws business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses largest  most profitable customers and product lines 

 

 

 

itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company’s operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital at the same time these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

path to full potential  finishing the job 

since the launch of the enterprise strategy the company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage but for the company to truly finish the job and reach its full potential every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential to do so the company remains focused on its core principles to position itw to perform to its full potential 

 

portfolio discipline 

the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant longterm competitive advantage from the itw business model itw businesses have the right “raw material” in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive abovemarket organic growth over the longterm 

the company focuses on highquality businesses ensuring it operates in markets with positive longterm macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itws differentiated products services and solutions itw’s portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments 

as part of its agenda to finish the job the company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent longterm performance this includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective highquality acquisitions to supplement itw’s longterm growth potential 

the company previously communicated its intent to explore options including potential divestitures for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to 1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company completed the divestitures of three businesses and continues to evaluate options for certain other businesses the company expects any earnings per share dilution from divestitures would be offset by incremental share repurchases refer to note 2 divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information regarding divestitures 

8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

the 8020 fronttoback process is a rigorous iterative and highly datadriven approach to identify where the company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable highquality organic growth the company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities markets customers and products 

itw will continue its efforts to finish the job and drive 8020 fronttoback practice excellence in every division in the company every day driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 8020 fronttoback practice across the company division by division will produce further customerfacing performance improvement in a number of the companys divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level 

fullpotential organic growth 

reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable highquality organic growth the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve fullpotential organic growth in every division with specific focus on 

 

as the company continues to make progress toward its full potential the company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the longterm organic growth potential of itw through the addition of selective highquality acquisitions 

current year developments 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

distribution methods 

the company’s businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors 

backlog 

backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the company’s businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of their products total backlog was 15 billion and 16 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively due to the predominately shortterm nature of the companys arrangements with its customers backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2020 were not material as of december 31 2019  

competition

in virtually all segments the company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation product quality brand preference and service delivery technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments the company believes that each segments primary competitive advantages derive from the companys business model and decentralized operating structure which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics this structure enables the companys businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the companys 8020 fronttoback process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities the company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets especially in its automotive oem segment

the companys results are impacted by global economic conditions downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses results of operations or financial condition 

the companys businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe slower economic growth financial market instability natural disasters public health crises high unemployment government deficit reduction sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company’s businesses by reducing demand for the companys products and services limiting financing available to the companys customers causing production delays increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable increasing price competition or increasing the risk that counterparties to the companys contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations 

the global nature of the companys operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business results of operations or financial condition 

over 50 of the companys net sales are derived from customers outside the united states and the company currently operates in 53 countries the risks inherent in the companys global operations include 



 

the current global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies further changes in us trade policy including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs and additional retaliatory actions by us trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions additionally in early 2020 an outbreak of the coronavirus occurred in china and other jurisdictions the extent of the outbreak and its impact on the markets served by the company and on its operations is uncertain a prolonged outbreak could interrupt the operations of the company and its customers and suppliers if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the risks could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

the benefits from the company’s enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the companys financial results could be adversely impacted or the company may not meet its longterm financial performance targets 

as the company continues to execute on its enterprise strategy initiatives it remains focused on the core principles of portfolio discipline 8020 fronttoback practice excellence and organic growth product line and customer base simplification activities which are core elements of the company’s 8020 fronttoback process continue to be applied by the company’s operating divisions and are active elements of the enterprise strategy although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company’s overall organic revenue growth in the short term additionally other core activities of the enterprise strategy related to portfolio discipline and organic growth including customerback innovation and strategic sales excellence may not have the desired impact on future operating results if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives the companys financial results could be adversely impacted or the company may not meet its longterm financial performance targets 

the timing and amount of the company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties 

share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company’s capital allocation strategy the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and shortterm borrowings the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause the company to limit suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions the price of the companys common stock the nature of other investment opportunities presented to the company from time to time the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of us cash 

the company may incur fines or penalties damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees agents or business partners violate antibribery competition export and import environmental or other laws 

the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decisionmaking autonomy within the company’s strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees agents or business partners that might violate us andor nonus laws including antibribery competition export and import and environmental laws any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries or could damage its reputation 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the companys operating income 

although the companys financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the companys profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values and in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products its future growth may be adversely affected 

the companys ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources difficulties or delays in research development production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the companys competitive position if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation its organic growth may be adversely affected

the company had significant divestiture activity in 2012 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative and it divested additional businesses in 2019 as it continues portfolio refinements to maintain portfolio discipline the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters which could adversely affect the companys financial results 

the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial results 

the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets including significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets impairment charges could adversely affect the companys financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in the companys credit ratings could increase the companys funding costs or reduce the availability of credit 

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets the company’s continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets in addition the company’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company’s credit ratings are negatively impacted its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the companys results of operations and profit margins in particular changes in trade policies the imposition of duties and tariffs potential retaliatory countermeasures and severe weather events could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials due to pricing pressure or other factors the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation that included significant changes to the taxation of business entities the company’s accounting for the tax effects of the act may be subject to change due to subsequent clarification of the tax law which could adversely affect the companys operating results or financial condition 

the companys defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

the companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of selfinsurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses in addition the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future even if it maintains adequate insurance programs claims could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable adequate or costeffective insurance in the future 

uncertainty related to environmental regulation and industry standards as well as physical risks of climate change could impact the companys results of operations and financial position 

increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks including global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks these regulations or standards could mandate even more restrictive requirements such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions and production of single use plastics than the voluntary commitments that the company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty in addition the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources sources and supply of energy product demand and manufacturing if environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products or the companys operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted 

if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches or if there is a violation of data privacy laws there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage

introduction 

illinois tool works inc the company or itw is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 84 divisions in 53 countries as of december 31 2019  the company employed approximately 45000 people 

the companys operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments automotive oem food equipment test  measurement and electronics welding polymers  fluids construction products and specialty products 

due to the large number of diverse businesses and the companys decentralized operating structure the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results instead the companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements operating revenue operating income operating margin overhead costs number of months on hand in inventory days sales outstanding in accounts receivable past due receivables and return on invested capital these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management 

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company’s core source of value creation the itw business model is the company’s competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders it is comprised of three unique elements 

 

 

 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

 

as a result of this work itws business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses largest  most profitable customers and product lines 

 

 

 

itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company’s operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital at the same time these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

path to full potential  finishing the job 

since the launch of the enterprise strategy the company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage but for the company to truly finish the job and reach its full potential every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential to do so the company remains focused on its core principles to position itw to perform to its full potential 

 

portfolio discipline 

the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant longterm competitive advantage from the itw business model itw businesses have the right “raw material” in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive abovemarket organic growth over the longterm 

the company focuses on highquality businesses ensuring it operates in markets with positive longterm macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itws differentiated products services and solutions itw’s portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments 

as part of its agenda to finish the job the company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent longterm performance this includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective highquality acquisitions to supplement itw’s longterm growth potential 

the company previously communicated its intent to explore options including potential divestitures for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to 1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company completed the divestitures of three businesses and continues to evaluate options for certain other businesses the company expects any earnings per share dilution from divestitures would be offset by incremental share repurchases refer to note 2 divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information regarding divestitures 

8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

the 8020 fronttoback process is a rigorous iterative and highly datadriven approach to identify where the company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable highquality organic growth the company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities markets customers and products 

itw will continue its efforts to finish the job and drive 8020 fronttoback practice excellence in every division in the company every day driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 8020 fronttoback practice across the company division by division will produce further customerfacing performance improvement in a number of the companys divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level 

fullpotential organic growth 

reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable highquality organic growth the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve fullpotential organic growth in every division with specific focus on 

 

as the company continues to make progress toward its full potential the company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the longterm organic growth potential of itw through the addition of selective highquality acquisitions 

terms used by itw

the company does not believe that tariffs imposed in the past year have had a material impact on its operating results the company will continue to evaluate the impact of enacted and proposed tariffs on its businesses as well as pricing actions to mitigate the impact of any raw material cost increases resulting from these tariffs 

in early 2020 an outbreak of the coronavirus occurred in china and other jurisdictions the extent of the outbreak and its impact on the markets served by the company and on its operations is uncertain a prolonged outbreak could interrupt the operations of the company and its customers and suppliers 

the company presents certain financial measures in fiscal year 2017 excluding the 658 million tax charge related to the tax cuts and jobs act and the benefit of a favorable 95 million legal settlement these nongaap measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the companys operating performance the company believes these nongaap measures enhance investors understanding of the companys underlying financial performance as well as their ability to compare the companys financial results and overall performance to that of its peers

permanently invested may be repatriated to the us the company has accrued for foreign withholding taxes related to foreign held cash and equivalents that are not permanently invested 

in the us the company utilizes cash flows from operations to fund domestic cash needs and the companys capital allocation priorities this includes operating needs of the us businesses dividend payments share repurchases acquisitions servicing of domestic debt obligations reinvesting to fund expansion of existing us businesses and general corporate needs the company may also use its commercial paper program which is backed by longterm credit facilities for shortterm liquidity needs the company believes cash generated by operations and liquidity provided by the companys commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the us

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company has three accounting policies that it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and in some cases on observable market information various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the companys critical accounting policies are as follows 

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2019  the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately  53 billion allocated to its reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 fronttoback process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 167 million to 12 billion with the average amount equal to 533 million fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 11 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 41 million the company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weightedaverage rate see note 11 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 4 million

the information set forth below is applicable to all segments of the company unless otherwise noted 

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company’s core source of value creation this business model is the company’s competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements 

 



 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model since then itw has made considerable progress in its path to full potential 

the roots of itw’s enterprise strategy began in late 2011  early 2012 when the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns itw developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

based on this rigorous evaluation itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

 

as a result of this work itw’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses’ largest  most profitable customers and product lines 

 

 

 

itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company’s operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital at the same time these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

path to full potential  finishing the job 

since the launch of the enterprise strategy the company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage but for the company to truly reach its full potential over the next five years every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential to do so the company remains focused on three key areas to finish the job of positioning itw to perform to its full potential 

 

portfolio discipline 

the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant longterm competitive advantage from the itw business model itw businesses have the right “raw material” in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive abovemarket organic growth over the longterm 

the company focuses on highquality businesses ensuring it operates in markets with positive longterm macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itws differentiated products services and solutions itw’s portfolio operates in diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments 

8020 fronttoback practice excellence 

the 8020 fronttoback process is a rigorous iterative and highly datadriven approach to identify where the company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable highquality organic growth the company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities markets customers and products itw will continue its efforts to drive 8020 fronttoback practice excellence in every division in the company every day 

fullpotential organic growth 

reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable highquality organic growth the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve fullpotential organic growth in every division at the same time the company consistently reviews its portfolio assesses businesses that are growthchallenged and evaluates if further portfolio refinements may be needed the company is currently exploring options including potential divestitures for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to 1 billion if a decision is made to divest any of these businesses the company expects that earnings per share dilution would be offset by incremental share repurchases 

divestiture activity 

divestiture of the industrial packaging segment — in february 2013 the company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the industrial packaging segment in september 2013 the company’s board of directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the industrial packaging segment the company classified the industrial packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations 

on february 6 2014 the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the industrial packaging business to the carlyle group for 32 billion the transaction was completed on may 1 2014 resulting in a pretax gain of 17 billion 11 billion aftertax in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in income from discontinued operations 

current year developments 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

distribution methods 

the company’s businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors 

backlog 

backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the company’s businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of their products backlog by segment as of december 31 2018  and 2017  was as follows 



due to the predominately short term nature of the companys arrangements with its customers backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2019  were not material as of december 31 2018  

competition 

with operations in 55  countries the company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets many of which are fragmented and the company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line end market and geographic area the companys competitors include many regional or specialized companies as well as large us and nonus companies or divisions of large companies each of the companys segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas in addition to numerous smaller regional competitors the welding segment competes globally with lincoln electric and esab 

in virtually all segments the company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation product quality brand preference and service delivery technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments the company believes that each segments primary competitive advantages derive from the companys business model and decentralized operating structure which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics this structure enables the companys businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the companys 8020 fronttoback process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities the company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets especially in its automotive oem segment

 item 1a   risk factors 

the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

the companys results are impacted by global economic conditions downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses results of operations or financial condition 

the companys businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe slower economic growth financial market instability natural disasters public health crises high unemployment government deficit reduction sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company’s businesses by reducing demand for the companys products and services limiting financing available to the companys customers causing production delays increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable increasing price competition or increasing the risk that counterparties to the companys contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations 

the global nature of the companys operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business results of operations or financial condition 

over 50 of the companys net sales are derived from customers outside the united states and the company currently operates in 55  countries the risks inherent in the companys global operations include 

 

if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the risks could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition in addition the current global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies further changes in us trade policy including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs additional retaliatory actions by us trade partners or worsening of economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

the benefits from the company’s enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the companys financial results could be adversely impacted 

with the initial enterprise strategy initiatives of portfolio management and business structure simplification largely complete the companys focus has pivoted to organic revenue growth and continued margin improvement product line and 

customer base simplification activities which are core elements of the company’s 8020 fronttoback process continue to be applied to the company’s scaled up operating divisions and remain active elements of the enterprise strategy although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company’s overall organic revenue growth in the short term if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives the companys financial results could be adversely impacted 

the timing and amount of the company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties 

share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company’s capital allocation strategy the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and shortterm borrowings the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause the company to limit suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions the price of the companys common stock the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of us cash 

the company may incur fines or penalties damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees agents or business partners violate antibribery competition export and import environmental or other laws 

the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decisionmaking autonomy within the company’s strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees agents or business partners that might violate us andor nonus laws including antibribery competition export and import and environmental laws any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries or could damage its reputation 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the companys operating income 

although the companys financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the companys profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values and in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products its future growth may be adversely affected 

the companys ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources difficulties or delays in research development production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the companys competitive position if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation its organic growth may be adversely affected 

if the company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

protecting the companys intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks andor other intellectual property rights related to many of its products and also has exclusive and nonexclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others the companys intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the companys intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the companys competitive position and results of operations 

the companys acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns 

the company has engaged in various acquisitions in the past and could choose to acquire additional businesses in the future acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial accounting managerial and operational challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect the companys profitability and returns 

 

past divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the companys financial results 

the companys divestiture activity increased in 2012 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative and the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters which could adversely affect the companys financial results 

the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial results 

the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets including significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets impairment charges could adversely affect the companys financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in the companys credit ratings could increase the companys funding costs or reduce the availability of credit 

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets the company’s continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets in addition the company’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company’s credit ratings are negatively impacted its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the companys results of operations and profit margins in particular changes in trade policies the imposition of duties and tariffs and potential retaliatory countermeasures could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials due to pricing pressure or other factors the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation that included significant changes to the taxation of business entities the company’s accounting for the tax effects of the act may be subject to change due to subsequent clarification of the tax law which could adversely affect the companys operating results or financial condition 

the companys defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

the companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of selfinsurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses in addition the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future even if it maintains adequate insurance programs claims could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable adequate or costeffective insurance in the future 

uncertainty related to climate change regulation and industry standards could impact the companys results of operations and financial position 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions than the voluntary commitments that the company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products they could negatively impact the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches or if there is a violation of data privacy laws there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage 

the company relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance in addition security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees partners customers or suppliers we are also subject to data privacy laws including the eu general data protection regulation in the various countries in which we operate if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner or if we violate data privacy laws there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage

since the launch of the enterprise strategy the company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage but for the company to truly reach its full potential over the next five years every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential to do so the company remains focused on three key areas to finish the job of positioning itw to perform to its full potential 

 

portfolio discipline

fullpotential organic growth 

reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable highquality organic growth the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve fullpotential organic growth in every division at the same time the company consistently reviews its portfolio assesses businesses that are growthchallenged and evaluates if further portfolio refinements may be needed the company is currently exploring options including potential divestitures for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to 1 billion if a decision is made to divest any of these businesses the company expects that earnings per share dilution would be offset by incremental share repurchases

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and shortterm credit facilities in addition the company had 15 billion  of cash and equivalents on hand at december 31 2018  and also maintains strong access to public debt markets management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the companys capital allocation priorities which include 

 

the company believes that based on its operating revenue operating margin free cash flow and credit ratings it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary 

cash flow 

the company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and debt repayment the company believes this nongaap financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the company’s financial performance and measures the companys ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies  summarized cash flow information for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was as follows

adjusted aftertax return on average invested capital 

the company uses adjusted aftertax return on average invested capital roic to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits roic is a nongaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate roic for comparability the company excluded the third quarter net discrete tax benefit of 15 million from the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 the company also excluded the 658 million income tax charge from the effective tax rate and the 95 million confidential legal settlement from the calculation of roic for the year ended december 31 2017 adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the company excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the companys operations as well as the companys equity investment in the wilsonart business formerly the decorative surfaces segment average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter roic for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was as follows

working capital 

management uses working capital as a measurement of the shortterm liquidity of the company net working capital at december 31 2018  and 2017  is summarized as follows 



the decrease in net working capital at december 31 2018  was primarily driven by lower cash and equivalents and higher shortterm debt due to current maturities of longterm debt 

as of december 31 2018  a majority of the companys cash and equivalents was held by international subsidiaries cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the us a portion of the cash and equivalents balances held internationally is typically used for international operating needs reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses used to fund new international acquisitions or used to repay debt held internationally in the us the company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments share repurchases acquisitions servicing of domestic debt obligations reinvesting to fund expansion of existing us businesses and general corporate needs the company also uses its commercial paper program which is backed by longterm credit facilities for shortterm liquidity needs the company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the companys commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the us 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” was enacted in the united states the provisions of the act significantly revised the us corporate income tax rules including a onetime repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of post1986 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the onetime repatriation provisions of the act the company provided for substantially all us taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 during 2018 the company repatriated approximately 30 billion of cash and equivalents held by its international subsidiaries a portion of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper and to fund additional share repurchases refer to note 6 income taxes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

debt 

total debt at december 31 2018  and 2017  was as follows 



as of december 31 2018  shortterm debt included 650 million related to the 195 notes due march 1 2019 and 700 million related to the 625 notes due april 1 2019 which were reclassified from longterm debt to shortterm debt in the first and second quarters of 2018 respectively there was no commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2018  shortterm debt as of december 31 2017 included commercial paper of 849 million  

the company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs share repurchases and small and mediumsized acquisitions during the second quarter of 2016 the company entered into a 25 billion  fiveyear line of credit agreement with a termination date of may 9 2021 to support the potential issuances of commercial paper no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit agreement at december 31 2018  the maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2018  was 12 billion while the average daily balance was 210 million as of december 31 2018  the companys foreign operations had authorized credit facilities with unused capacity of 227 million  

total debt to ebitda 

the company uses the ratio of total debt to ebitda as a measure of its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations the company believes that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the companys long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are nongaap financial measures the ratio of total debt to ebitda represents total debt divided by net income before interest expense other income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis total debt to ebitda for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was as follows 



stockholders’ equity 

the changes to stockholders’ equity during 2018  and 2017  were as follows 



contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the companys significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  were as follows 



as of december 31 2018  the company had recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of 155 million the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2018  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company has three accounting policies that it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and in some cases on observable market information various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the companys critical accounting policies are as follows 

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if 

triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2018  the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately  57 billion  allocated to its reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 fronttoback process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 43 million to 13 billion with the average amount equal to 518 million fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 10 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 41 million beginning in 2017 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs the new method provides a more precise measure of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weightedaverage rate see note 10 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 4 million

the information set forth below is applicable to all segments of the company unless otherwise noted 

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company’s core source of value creation this business model is the company’s competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements 

 

 

 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began the first phase of its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model since then itw has made considerable progress as evidenced by the company’s strong financial performance over the past five years 

the roots of itw’s enterprise strategy began in late 2011  early 2012 when the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns itw developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

based on this rigorous evaluation itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

 

as a result of this work itw’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses’ largest  most profitable customers and product lines with the initiative nearly complete and itw businesses demonstrating notably improved financial performance the company believes that the product line simplification work is returning to more normalized levels 

 

 

 

itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company’s operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital at the same time these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns with this first phase of the strategy nearing completion the company will look ahead to the next five years and delivering differentiated performance on a sustained basis 

sustained differentiated performance 

while the company has made considerable progress and itw’s performance is nearing bestinclass levels the company has significant opportunity for further improvement the second phase of the strategic framework is focused on delivering 

differentiated performance on a sustained basis with consistent above market organic growth moving forward the company remains committed to the four strategic principles that have served as the foundation of its progress over the past five years and that the company believes best positions itw to deliver continued differentiated performance over the next five years 

 

the itw business model is the companys competitive advantage 

the itw business model is the combination of a set of strategic operational and cultural approaches and practices that is applied to every itw business the business model has existed inside the company for over 30 years and is truly itws differentiating competitive advantage the itw business model is comprised of three elements 

• 8020 front to back process  how the company operates 

• customerback innovation approach  how the company innovates 

• decentralized entrepreneurial culture  how the company executes 

focus on quality growth 

itw prioritizes highquality revenue growth  and as such the company’s primary growth focus is organic 

leveraging the business model and the 8020 front to back process provides a clear view of where to focus for high quality growth the company targets differentiated endmarkets and customers with critical needs and challenging pain points itw generates highquality growth through consistent customerback innovation and customer service excellence 

the company only invests and operates in industries and businesses that have the right “raw material” to generate high quality organic growth through the application of the itw business model itw’s current portfolio of seven segments offers solid growth potential and a high degree of diversification in terms of geographic and end market exposures enabling the company to deliver consistent highquality growth in an increasingly volatile and competitive global market environment 

do what we say execution is a critical differentiator 

itw’s commitment to execution is a key differentiator for itw living up to the company’s commitments  “do what we say” execution  is a deeply embedded core element of the culture the culture is the engine that translates itws strategy into action and action into results 

all divisions function within a “framework” that defines how the culture operates and defines the company’s values business model and strategy to ensure all divisions are working toward our common set of goals business leaders have the flexibility to define the actions and customize their approach to meet those goals this “flexibility within the framework” establishes an entrepreneurial environment where decisions are made “bottom up” by those with the greatest knowledge capability and proximity to the customer which enables our businesses to be nimble and react quickly to market conditions and customer requirements 

itw is simple straightforward and transparent in everything it does the company sets clear performance expectations and financial targets executes against these at the appropriate pace and establishes the freedom to define how to achieve results within the construct of the business model 

invest only where itw has a competitive advantage 

the company is highly focused and disciplined in its approach to invest only where it can leverage the itw business model into compelling and sustainable competitive advantage 

investments to support organic growth and sustain its highly differentiated core businesses such as new product innovation marketing programs simplification projects and capital investments are itw’s number one investment priority

the timing and amount of the company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties 

share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company’s capital allocation strategy the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and shortterm borrowings the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause the company to limit suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions the price of the companys common stock the nature of other investment 

opportunities presented to us from time to time the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of us cash 

the company may incur fines or penalties damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees agents or business partners violate antibribery competition export and import environmental or other laws 

the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decisionmaking autonomy within the company’s strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees agents or business partners that might violate us andor nonus laws including antibribery competition export and import and environmental laws any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries or could damage its reputation 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the companys operating income 

although the companys financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the companys profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values and in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products its future growth may be adversely affected 

the companys ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources difficulties or delays in research development production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the companys competitive position if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation its organic growth may be adversely affected 

if the company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted

increase the companys expenses adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations 

 

past divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the companys financial results 

the companys divestiture activity increased in 2012 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters 

the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial results 

the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets including significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets impairment charges could result that adversely affect the companys financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in the companys credit ratings could increase the companys funding costs or reduce the availability of credit 

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets the company’s continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets in addition the company’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company’s credit ratings are negatively impacted its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the companys results of operations and profit margins due to pricing pressure or other factors the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 

the us government has recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities the company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and onetime transition tax however the ultimate impact of this tax reform is uncertain due to subsequent clarification of the tax law and refinement of estimated amounts and the companys business and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the companys defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

the companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of selfinsurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses in addition the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future even if it maintains adequate insurance programs claims could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable adequate or costeffective insurance in the future 

uncertainty related to climate change regulation and industry standards could impact the companys results of operations and financial position 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions than the voluntary commitments that the company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products they could negatively impact the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage 

the company relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance in addition security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees partners customers or suppliers if these information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage

the companys operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments automotive oem food equipment test  measurement and electronics welding polymers  fluids construction products and specialty products

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company’s core source of value creation this business model is the company’s competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements 

 

 

 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began the first phase of its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model since then itw has made considerable progress as evidenced by the company’s strong financial performance over the past five years 

the roots of itw’s enterprise strategy began in late 2011  early 2012 when the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns itw developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

based on this rigorous evaluation itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

 

as a result of this work itw’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses’ largest  most profitable customers and product lines with the initiative nearly complete and itw businesses demonstrating notably improved financial performance the company believes that the product line simplification work is returning to more normalized levels 

 

 

 

itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company’s operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital at the same time these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns with this first phase of the strategy nearing completion the company will look ahead to the next five years and delivering differentiated performance on a sustained basis 

sustained differentiated performance 

while the company has made considerable progress and itw’s performance is nearing bestinclass levels the company has significant opportunity for further improvement the second phase of the strategic framework is focused on delivering differentiated performance on a sustained basis with consistent above market organic growth moving forward the company remains committed to the four strategic principles that have served as the foundation of its progress over the past five years and that the company believes best positions itw to deliver continued differentiated performance over the next five years 

 

the itw business model is the companys competitive advantage 

the itw business model is the combination of a set of strategic operational and cultural approaches and practices that is applied to every itw business the business model has existed inside the company for over 30 years and is truly itws differentiating competitive advantage the itw business model is comprised of three elements 

• 8020 front to back process  how the company operates 

• customerback innovation approach  how the company innovates 

• decentralized entrepreneurial culture  how the company executes 

focus on quality growth 

itw prioritizes highquality revenue growth  and as such the company’s primary growth focus is organic 

leveraging the business model and the 8020 front to back process provides a clear view of where to focus for high quality growth the company targets differentiated endmarkets and customers with critical needs and challenging pain points itw generates highquality growth through consistent customerback innovation and customer service excellence 

the company only invests and operates in industries and businesses that have the right “raw material” to generate high quality organic growth through the application of the itw business model itw’s current portfolio of seven segments offers solid growth potential and a high degree of diversification in terms of geographic and end market exposures enabling the company to deliver consistent highquality growth in an increasingly volatile and competitive global market environment 

do what we say execution is a critical differentiator 

itw’s commitment to execution is a key differentiator for itw living up to the company’s commitments  “do what we say” execution  is a deeply embedded core element of the culture the culture is the engine that translates itws strategy into action and action into results 

all divisions function within a “framework” that defines how the culture operates and defines the company’s values business model and strategy to ensure all divisions are working toward our common set of goals business leaders have the flexibility to define the actions and customize their approach to meet those goals this “flexibility within the framework” establishes an entrepreneurial environment where decisions are made “bottom up” by those with the greatest knowledge capability and proximity to the customer which enables our businesses to be nimble and react quickly to market conditions and customer requirements 

itw is simple straightforward and transparent in everything it does the company sets clear performance expectations and financial targets executes against these at the appropriate pace and establishes the freedom to define how to achieve results within the construct of the business model 

invest only where itw has a competitive advantage 

the company is highly focused and disciplined in its approach to invest only where it can leverage the itw business model into compelling and sustainable competitive advantage 

investments to support organic growth and sustain its highly differentiated core businesses such as new product innovation marketing programs simplification projects and capital investments are itw’s number one investment priority

effective january 1 2018 

in may 2014 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition the core principle of the new guidance is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required the companys sales arrangements with customers are predominately short term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control and revenue recognition at the time of product shipment or delivery of service in limited circumstances arrangements may include service performed over time or there may be significant obligations to the customer that are unfulfilled at the time of shipment typically involving installation of equipment and customer acceptance effective january 1 2018 the company adopted this new guidance under the modified retrospective method which requires the new guidance to be applied prospectively to revenue transactions completed on or after the effective date given the nature of the company’s revenue transactions the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s operating revenue results of operations or financial position as a result of adopting the guidance the company expects to record a cumulativeeffect adjustment reducing retained earnings as of january 1 2018 by approximately 10 million related to certain transactions that were impacted by the new guidance additionally the company expects to provide the required additional disclosures in periods subsequent to adoption

the company believes that based on its operating revenue operating margin free cash flow and credit ratings it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary 

cash flow 

the company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and debt repayment the company believes this nongaap financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the company’s financial performance and measures the companys ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies  summarized cash flow information for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was as follows

adjusted aftertax return on average invested capital 

the company uses adjusted aftertax return on average invested capital roic to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits roic is a nongaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate roic for comparability the company excluded the 658 million income tax charge from the effective tax rate and the 95 million confidential legal settlement from the calculation of roic for the year ended december 31 2017 adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the company excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the companys operations as well as the companys equity investment in the wilsonart business formerly the decorative surfaces segment average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter roic for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was as follows

a reconciliation of the 2017 effective tax rate excluding the discrete tax charge related to the 2017 us tax legislation is as follows 



working capital 

management uses working capital as a measurement of the shortterm liquidity of the company net working capital at december 31 2017  and 2016  is summarized as follows 



the increase in net working capital at december 31 2017  was primarily driven by higher cash and equivalents 

cash and equivalents totaled approximately 31 billion as of december 31 2017  and 25 billion as of december 31 2016  primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the us a portion of the cash and equivalents balances held internationally is typically used for international operating needs reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses used to fund new international acquisitions or used to repay debt held internationally in the us the company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments share repurchases acquisitions servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs the company also uses its commercial paper program which is backed by longterm credit facilities for shortterm liquidity needs the company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the companys commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the us 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” was enacted in the united states the provisions of the act significantly revise the us corporate income tax rules including a onetime repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of post1986 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company recorded a onetime additional income tax expense of 658 million related to the enactment of the act which among other items included the onetime deemed repatriation tax as a result of the onetime repatriation provisions of the act the company has provided for substantially all us taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and expects to repatriate approximately 2 billion  of foreign held cash and equivalents see note 5 income taxes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

total debt to ebitda 

the company uses the ratio of total debt to ebitda to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations the company believes that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the companys long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are nongaap financial measures the ratio of total debt to ebitda represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense other income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis total debt to ebitda for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was as follows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company has six accounting policies that it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and in some cases on observable market information various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the companys critical accounting policies are as follows 

realizability of inventories — inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value generally the company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to net realizable value based on the following usage criteria 



in addition for approximately 21  of total inventories the company has elected to use the lastin firstout lifo method of inventory costing generally this method results in a lower inventory value than the firstin firstout fifo method due to the effects of inflation 

collectibility of accounts receivable — the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical writeoff percentage over the last two years in addition reserves for customer credits and cash discounts are estimated based on past experience 

depreciation of plant and equipment —  the company’s us businesses primarily compute depreciation on an accelerated basis as follows 



the majority of the companys international businesses compute depreciation on a straightline basis 

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2017  the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately  60 billion  allocated to its reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 front to back process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 45 million to 13 billion with the average amount equal to 546 million fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 9 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be 

effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 40 million beginning in 2017 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs the new method provides a more precise measure of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weightedaverage rate see note 9 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 4 million

the information set forth below is applicable to all segments of the company unless otherwise noted 

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company’s core source of value creation this business model is the company’s competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements 

 



 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began the process of transitioning the company onto its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model since then itw has made considerable progress as evidenced by the company’s strong financial performance over the past four years 

the roots of itw’s enterprise strategy began in late 2011  early 2012 when the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns itw developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

based on this rigorous evaluation itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

 

as a result of this work itw’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses’ largest  most profitable customers and product lines with the initiative nearly complete and itw businesses demonstrating notably improved financial performance the company believes that the significant product line simplification work is essentially finalized and will return to more normalized levels in 2017 and beyond 

 

 

 

once the business has achieved operational excellence and identified the right growth opportunities the final step is to accelerate organic growth the process of preparing for accelerated organic growth generally takes 18 to 24 months 

based on the financial performance of the divisions that are further along in this process the company believes that its organic growth framework is capable of delivering abovemarket organic growth across all segments divisions 

are at various phases in preparation for growth and many are either ready to grow or already growing above their respective markets itw management is fully aligned with this plan and very focused on executing it with the close of 2016 approximately 85 percent of the divisions are ready to grow 

path to full potential 

while the company has made considerable progress and itw’s performance is nearing bestinclass levels the company has significant opportunity for further improvement before it achieves full operating potential in order to do so itw is focused on two key areas of opportunity including additional structural margin improvement and sustained abovemarket organic growth with strong incremental profitability 

additional structural margin improvement 

to deliver on the additional structural margin improvement the company is implementing the following two levers 1 further leveraging the 8020 management process and 2 strategic sourcing 

 

 

sustained abovemarket organic growth with strong incremental profitability 

itw has done extensive work on its portfolio and operating structure to position the company to deliver sustainable abovemarket organic growth the company has narrowed the focus and significantly improved the growth potential of itw’s business portfolio with approximately 85 of its divisions ready to grow as of the end of 2016 itw is well positioned for accelerated growth in 2017 and beyond to deliver on this accelerated growth the divisions have been implementing the organic growth framework which includes continued investment in customerback innovation and a strengthened focus on market penetration itw continues to focus on growing its share of 80 products with existing customers with whom the company has a resonant value proposition as well as target potential new customers with similar pain points to existing customers itw has made strong progress on the company’s pivot to organic growth and is well positioned to deliver on sustained abovemarket organic growth over the longterm 

divestiture activity

in virtually all segments the company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation product quality brand preference and service delivery technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments the company believes that each segments primary competitive advantages derive from the companys business model and decentralized operating structure which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics this structure enables the companys businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the companys 8020 management process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities the company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets especially in its automotive oem segment

the companys results are impacted by global economic conditions downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses results of operations or financial condition 

the companys businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe including the uncertainty created by the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote to leave the european union slower economic growth financial market instability high unemployment government deficit reduction sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company’s businesses by reducing demand for the companys products and services limiting financing available to the companys customers increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts 

receivable increasing price competition or increasing the risk that counterparties to the companys contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations 

the global nature of the companys operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business results of operations or financial condition 

the company currently operates in 57  countries the risks inherent in the companys global operations include 

 

the united kingdoms vote in june 2016 to leave the european union may increase certain of the risks and uncertainties described above the united kingdom represented approximately 5 of the companys total consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the risks could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

the benefits from the company’s enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the companys financial results could be adversely impacted 

as the company has substantially completed its enterprise strategy initiatives of portfolio management and business structure simplification its focus has pivoted to organic revenue growth and continued margin improvement product line and customer base simplification activities which are core elements of the company’s 8020 management process continue to be applied to the company’s scaled up operating divisions and remain active elements of the enterprise strategy although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company’s overall organic revenue growth in the short term if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives the companys financial results could be adversely impacted 

the timing and amount of the company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties 

share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company’s capital allocation strategy the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and shortterm borrowings the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause the company to limit suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions the price of the companys common stock the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of us cash 

the company may incur fines or penalties damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees agents or business partners violate antibribery competition export and import environmental or other laws 

the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decisionmaking autonomy within the company’s strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees agents or business partners that might violate us andor nonus laws including antibribery competition export and import and environmental laws any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries or could damage its reputation 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the companys operating income 

although the companys financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the companys profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values and in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property its future growth may be adversely affected 

the companys ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources difficulties or delays in research development production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the companys competitive position if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation its organic growth may be adversely affected

the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in our credit ratings could increase our funding costs or reduce the availability of credit 

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets the company’s continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets in addition the company’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company’s credit ratings are negatively impacted its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the companys results of operations and profit margins due to pricing pressure or other factors the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 

the companys defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

the companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of selfinsurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses in addition the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future even if it maintains adequate insurance programs claims could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable adequate or costeffective insurance in the future 

if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage 

the company relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance in addition security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees partners customers or suppliers if these information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage

introduction 

illinois tool works inc the company or itw is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 85  divisions in 57  countries as of december 31 2016  the company employed approximately 50000   persons 

the companys operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments automotive oem food equipment test  measurement and electronics welding polymers  fluids construction products and specialty products 

due to the large number of diverse businesses and the companys decentralized operating structure the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results instead the companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements operating revenue operating income operating margin overhead costs number of months on hand in inventory days sales outstanding in accounts receivable past due receivables and return on invested capital these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management 

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company’s core source of value creation this business model is the company’s competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements 

 

 

 

enterprise strategy 

in late 2012 itw began the process of transitioning the company onto its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model since then itw has made considerable progress as evidenced by the company’s strong financial performance over the past four years 

the roots of itw’s enterprise strategy began in late 2011  early 2012 when the company undertook a complete review of its performance focusing on its businesses delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns itw developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations 

based on this rigorous evaluation itw determined that solid and consistent abovemarket organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders to shift its primary growth engine to organic the company began executing a multistep approach 

 

as a result of this work itw’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate pricecost increases the company achieved this through product line simplification or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers while supporting and growing the businesses’ largest  most profitable customers and product lines with the initiative nearly complete and itw businesses demonstrating notably improved financial performance the company believes that the significant product line simplification work is essentially finalized and will return to more normalized levels in 2017 and beyond 

 

 

 

once the business has achieved operational excellence and identified the right growth opportunities the final step is to accelerate organic growth the process of preparing for accelerated organic growth generally takes 18 to 24 months 

based on the financial performance of the divisions that are further along in this process the company believes that its organic growth framework is capable of delivering abovemarket organic growth across all segments divisions are at various phases in preparation for growth and many are either ready to grow or already growing above their respective markets itw management is fully aligned with this plan and very focused on executing it with the close of 2016 approximately 85 percent of the divisions are ready to grow 

path to full potential 

while the company has made considerable progress and itw’s performance is nearing bestinclass levels the company has significant opportunity for further improvement before it achieves full operating potential in order to do so itw is focused on two key areas of opportunity including additional structural margin improvement and sustained abovemarket organic growth with strong incremental profitability 

additional structural margin improvement 

to deliver on the additional structural margin improvement the company is implementing the following two levers 1 further leveraging the 8020 management process and 2 strategic sourcing 



management system has continuously been refined improved and expanded into a unique holistic business management process of interconnected tools which improves all aspects of the business and when applied consistently and executed more effectively will lead to additional margin improvement itw has clearly demonstrated superior 8020 management resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company’s operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital these 8020 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

 

sustained abovemarket organic growth with strong incremental profitability 

itw has done extensive work on its portfolio and operating structure to position the company to deliver sustainable abovemarket organic growth the company has narrowed the focus and significantly improved the growth potential of itw’s business portfolio with approximately 85 of its divisions ready to grow as of the end of 2016 itw is well positioned for accelerated growth in 2017 and beyond to deliver on this accelerated growth the divisions have been implementing the organic growth framework which includes continued investment in customerback innovation and a strengthened focus on market penetration itw continues to focus on growing its share of 80 products with existing customers with whom the company has a resonant value proposition as well as target potential new customers with similar pain points to existing customers itw has made strong progress on the company’s pivot to organic growth and is well positioned to deliver on sustained abovemarket organic growth over the longterm

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and shortterm credit facilities in addition the company had 25 billion  of cash on hand at december 31 2016  and also maintains strong access to public debt markets management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the companys capital allocation priorities which include 



 

in september 2013 the company’s board of directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the industrial packaging business the company classified the industrial packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations as to the impact of this divestiture on the company’s income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward the company also indicated that it intended to repurchase approximately 50 million shares through a program utilizing its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiturerelated dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds free cash flow and additional leverage the company completed this program in the second quarter of 2014 under this program the company repurchased approximately 140 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately 357 million shares of its common stock in the first half of 2014

management uses working capital as a measurement of the shortterm liquidity of the company net working capital at december 31 2016  and 2015  is summarized as follows 



the decrease in net working capital at december 31 2016  was primarily driven by lower cash and equivalents

total debt to ebitda 

the company uses the ratio of total debt to ebitda to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations the company believes that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the companys long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are nongaap financial measures the ratio of total debt to ebitda represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense other income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis total debt to ebitda for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  was as follows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company has six accounting policies that it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and in some cases on observable market information various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the companys critical accounting policies are as follows 

realizability of inventories — inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value generally the company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to net realizable value based on the following usage criteria 



in addition for approximately 22  of total inventories the company has elected to use the lastin firstout lifo method of inventory costing generally this method results in a lower inventory value than the firstin firstout fifo method due to the effects of inflation 

collectibility of accounts receivable — the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical writeoff percentage over the last two years in addition reserves for customer credits and cash discounts are estimated based on past experience 

depreciation of plant and equipment —  the company’s us businesses primarily compute depreciation on an accelerated basis as follows 



the majority of the companys international businesses compute depreciation on a straightline basis 

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous 

taxing jurisdictions income tax expense assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2016  the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately  60 billion  allocated to its reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 management process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 208 million to 14 billion with the average amount equal to 601 million fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 9 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 39 million 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 4 million 

beginning in 2017 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs the new method will provide a more precise measure of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weightedaverage rate the change is not expected to have a material impact on the 2017 net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs as the decrease in service and interest costs is largely offset by the impact of lower discount rates and expected returns on plan assets total estimated 2017 pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to be consistent with 2016 see note 9 pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8

the information set forth below is applicable to all segments of the company unless otherwise noted 

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company’s core source of value creation this business model is the company’s competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements 

 

 

 

enterprise strategy 

in 2013 itw began the process of transitioning the company onto its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model since then itw has made considerable progress as evidenced by the company’s strong financial performance over the past three years 

the roots of itw’s enterprise strategy began in 20112012 when the company undertook a complete review of its performance itw gathered deep insights from its businesses that were delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns and defined a strategy to replicate that performance throughout the company 

based on this rigorous and thorough evaluation itw determined two paths to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders one itw needed to shift the companys primary growth engine to organic and two the company needed to leverage the itw business model to deliver bestinclass margins and returns 

shift the company’s core growth engine to organic 

in order to pivot to fully focus on organic growth the company needed to first accomplish several preparatory steps these key initiatives were a major focus of the company in 20122015 which included portfolio management business structure simplification and strategic sourcing 

the first step portfolio management was to construct and maintain a business portfolio capable of delivering consistent abovemarket organic growth as part of this initiative to realign the portfolio itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a musthave requirement for all itw businesses this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions 

as a result of this work itw’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve margins and generate pricecost increases this was achieved through product line simplification which focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines most of this initiative is complete and itw businesses are demonstrating notably improved financial performance the company expects the remaining product line simplification work to largely be accomplished in 2016 

the second step business structure simplification was to scaleup itw’s operating structure to support increased engineering marketing and sales resources and to improve global reach and competitiveness all of which were critical to itw’s ability to drive accelerated organic growth itw now has 84 scaledup divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments core customers and products and customerback innovation 

with the portfolio realignment and scaleup work largely complete the company is now able to shift its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth 

as a third preparatory step itw is currently in the process of reapplying 8020 to optimize its newly scaledup divisions for growth this process involves first using 8020 to build a foundation of operational excellence and then applying 8020driven insights to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth 

once the business is operationally excellent and has identified the right growth opportunities the final step is to accelerate organic growth the process of preparing for accelerated organic growth generally takes 18 to 24 months 

based on the financial performance of the divisions that are further along in this process the company believes that this framework is capable of delivering above market organic growth in all itw segments many itw divisions are ready to grow and growing above their respective markets while the rest of the company’s divisions are at various phases of 

preparing to grow itw management is fully aligned on this plan and very focused on executing it by the end of 2016 the company expects approximately 85 percent of its businesses to be ready to grow 

leverage the itw business model to deliver bestinclass margins and returns 

the company’s work to deliver bestinclass margins and returns is focused on two key areas of ongoing activity the first is strategic sourcing   where the company seeks to benefit from its size and scale in procurement processes sourcing is now a core strategic and operational capability and this improved competitiveness supports itw’s organic growth framework the company’s 8020enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of 1 percent reduction in spend each year in 20132015 and is on track to do the same in 2016 and 2017 

the second element of the margins and returns area of focus is to better leverage the full power of the itw business model through a much more consistent and focused approach to 8020 best practice implementation across the company itw has clearly defined what excellence in the practice of itw’s 8020 management process looks like and the result is significant opportunity to create meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company’s improvement in both operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital these 8020 initiatives can result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

divestiture of majority interest in former decorative surfaces segment 

on october 31 2012 the company divested a 51 majority interest in the decorative surfaces segment accordingly the company ceased consolidating the results of the decorative surfaces segment as of october 31 2012 and now reports its 49 ownership interest using the equity method of accounting due to the companys continuing involvement through its 49 interest the historical operating results of decorative surfaces are presented in continuing operations effective november 1 2012 decorative surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the company 

divestiture of the industrial packaging segment 

in february 2013 the company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the industrial packaging segment in september 2013 the company’s board of directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the industrial packaging segment the company classified the industrial packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations 

on february 6 2014 the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the industrial packaging business to the carlyle group for 32 billion the transaction was completed on may 1 2014 resulting in a pretax gain of 17 billion 11 billion aftertax in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in income from discontinued operations

distribution methods

backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2016 were not material as of december 31 2015  

competition 

with operations in 57  countries the company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets many of which are fragmented and the company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line end market and geographic area the companys competitors include many regional or specialized companies as well as large us and nonus companies or divisions of large companies each of the companys segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas in addition to numerous smaller regional competitors the welding segment competes globally with lincoln electric and esab 

in virtually all segments the company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation product quality brand preference service delivery and price technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments the company believes that each segments primary competitive advantages derive from the companys business model and decentralized operating structure which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics this structure enables the companys businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the companys 8020 management process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities the company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets especially in its automotive oem segment 

raw materials 

the company uses raw materials of various types primarily steel resins chemicals and paper that are available from numerous commercial sources the availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems and no such problems are currently anticipated 

research and development 

developing new and improved products broadening the application of established products and continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods processes and equipment all contribute to the companys organic growth many new products are designed to reduce customers costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes reducing the number of parts in an assembly or improving the quality of customers assembled products typically the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications research and development expenses were 218 million in 2015  227 million in 2014  and 240 million in 2013

the companys results are impacted by global economic conditions downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses results of operations or financial condition 

the companys businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe slower economic growth financial market instability high unemployment government deficit reduction sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets we serve can adversely affect the company’s businesses by reducing demand for the companys products and services limiting financing available to the companys customers increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable increasing price competition and increasing the risk that counterparties to the companys contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations 

the global nature of the companys operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business results of operations or financial condition

 10 

 

if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the risks could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

the timing and amount of benefits from the company’s enterprise initiatives may not be as expected and the companys financial results could be adversely impacted 

the company’s enterprise strategy and associated initiatives include portfolio management business structure simplification and strategic sourcing the portfolio management initiative which included divesting businesses no longer aligned with the company’s longterm objectives is essentially complete however product line and customer base simplification which is a core element of the company’s 8020 management process is being reapplied to the company’s scaled up operating divisions and remains an active element of this initiative although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company’s overall organic revenue growth in the short term the companys business structure simplification initiative is also essentially completed although efforts to realize efficiencies in structure are continuous in addition the company continues to seek to benefit from its size and scale in the procurement process through its strategic sourcing initiatives and the leveraging of purchasing power across businesses involves some execution risk also as its portfolio and 8020 management activities have positioned its businesses for profitable growth the company has shifted its focus to organic growth and has expressed its belief that organic growth will be 200 basis points above global gdp by the end of 2017 if the company is unable to achieve the expected benefits from these initiatives or is unable to complete these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses the timing and amount of benefits from these initiatives may not be as expected and the companys financial results could be adversely impacted 

the timing and amount of the company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties 

share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company’s capital allocation strategy the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and shortterm borrowings the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause the company to limit suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions the price of the companys common stock the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of us cash 

the company may incur fines or penalties damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees agents or business partners violate antibribery competition export and import environmental or other laws 

the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decisionmaking autonomy within the company’s strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees agents or business partners that might violate us andor nonus laws including antibribery competition export and import and environmental laws any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries or could damage its reputation 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the companys operating income 

although the companys financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the companys profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values and in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property its future growth may be adversely affected 

the companys ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources difficulties or delays in research development production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the companys competitive position if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation its organic growth may be adversely affected

recent divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the companys financial results 

the companys divestiture activity increased in 2012 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters 

the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

in the past the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets including significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets impairment charges could result that adversely affect the companys financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in our credit ratings could increase our funding costs or reduce the availability of credit 

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets the company’s continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets in addition the company’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company’s credit ratings are negatively impacted its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the companys results of operations and profit margins due to pricing pressure or other factors the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts 

prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 

the companys defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

the companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of selfinsurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses in addition the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future even if it maintains adequate insurance programs claims could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable adequate or costeffective insurance in the future 

if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage 

the company relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures or computer viruses in addition security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if these information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage

the itw business model 

the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company’s core source of value creation this business model is the company’s competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements 

 

 

 

enterprise strategy 

in 2013 itw began the process of transitioning the company onto its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model since then itw has made considerable progress as evidenced by the company’s strong financial performance over the past three years 

the roots of itw’s enterprise strategy began in 20112012 when the company undertook a complete review of its performance itw gathered deep insights from its businesses that were delivering consistent abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns and defined a strategy to replicate that performance throughout the company 

based on this rigorous and thorough evaluation itw determined two paths to deliver worldclass financial performance and compelling longterm returns for its shareholders one itw needed to shift the companys primary growth engine to organic and two the company needed to leverage the itw business model to deliver bestinclass margins and returns 

shift the company’s core growth engine to organic 

in order to pivot to fully focus on organic growth the company needed to first accomplish several preparatory steps these key initiatives were a major focus of the company in 20122015 which included portfolio management business structure simplification and strategic sourcing 

the first step portfolio management was to construct and maintain a business portfolio capable of delivering consistent abovemarket organic growth as part of this initiative to realign the portfolio itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a musthave requirement for all itw businesses this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions 

as a result of this work itw’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve margins and generate pricecost increases this was achieved through product line simplification which focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines most of this initiative is complete and itw businesses are demonstrating notably improved financial performance the company expects the remaining product line simplification work to largely be accomplished in 2016 

the second step business structure simplification was to scaleup itw’s operating structure to support increased engineering marketing and sales resources and to improve global reach and competitiveness all of which were critical to itw’s ability to drive accelerated organic growth itw now has 84 scaledup divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments core customers and products and customerback innovation 

with the portfolio realignment and scaleup work largely complete the company is now able to shift its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth 

as a third preparatory step itw is currently in the process of reapplying 8020 to optimize its newly scaledup divisions for growth this process involves first using 8020 to build a foundation of operational excellence and then applying 8020driven insights to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth 

once the business is operationally excellent and has identified the right growth opportunities the final step is to accelerate organic growth the process of preparing for accelerated organic growth generally takes 18 to 24 months 

based on the financial performance of the divisions that are further along in this process the company believes that this framework is capable of delivering above market organic growth in all itw segments many itw divisions are ready to grow and growing above their respective markets while the rest of the company’s divisions are at various phases of preparing to grow itw management is fully aligned on this plan and very focused on executing it by the end of 2016 the company expects approximately 85 percent of its businesses to be ready to grow 

leverage the itw business model to deliver bestinclass margins and returns 

the company’s work to deliver bestinclass margins and returns is focused on two key areas of ongoing activity the first is strategic sourcing   where the company seeks to benefit from its size and scale in procurement processes sourcing is now a core strategic and operational capability and this improved competitiveness supports itw’s organic growth framework the company’s 8020enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of 1 percent reduction in spend each year in 20132015 and is on track to do the same in 2016 and 2017 

the second element of the margin and return area of focus is to better leverage the full power of the itw business model through a much more consistent and focused approach to 8020 best practice implementation across the company itw has clearly defined what excellence in the practice of itw’s 8020 management process looks like and the result is significant opportunity to create meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the 

company’s improvement in both operating margin and aftertax return on invested capital these 8020 initiatives can result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns

in september 2013 the company’s board of directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the industrial packaging business the company classified the industrial packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations as to the impact of this divestiture on the company’s income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward the company also indicated that it intended to repurchase approximately 50 million shares through a program utilizing its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiturerelated dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds free cash flow and additional leverage the company completed this program in the second quarter of 2014 under this program the company repurchased approximately 140 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately 357 million shares of its common stock in the first half of 2014

the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2015  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company has six accounting policies that it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and in some cases on observable market information various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the companys critical accounting policies are as follows 

realizability of inventories — inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value generally the company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to net realizable value based on the following usage criteria 



in addition for approximately 22  of total inventories the company has elected to use the lastin firstout lifo method of inventory costing generally this method results in a lower inventory value than the firstin firstout fifo method due to the effects of inflation 

collectibility of accounts receivable — the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical writeoff percentage over the last two years in addition the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts which are also estimated based on past experience 

depreciation of plant and equipment   —  the company’s us businesses primarily compute depreciation on an accelerated basis as follows 



the majority of the companys international businesses compute depreciation on a straightline basis 

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2015  the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of  60 billion  allocated to its reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 management process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 58 million to 15 billion with the average amount equal to 428 million fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 37 million 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 4 million see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions

enterprise strategy 

in 2012 the company embarked on an enterprise strategy with the objective of fully leveraging itw’s core capabilities to deliver strong financial performance itw’s enterprise strategy is centered on three key initiatives  portfolio management business structure simplification and strategic sourcing these enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns 

the foundation of this strategy is a set of business practices referred to as the itw business model consisting of three core elements 

8020 business process  the concept of the 8020 business process is to focus on what is most important the 20 of the items which account for 80 of the value and to spend less time and resources on the less important the 80 of the items which account for 20 of the value the company uses this 8020 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability and as a result reduces complexity that often creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important the company utilizes the 8020 process in all aspects of its business common applications of the 8020 business process include 

 

the result of the application of this 8020 business process is that the company has over time improved its longterm operating and financial performance these 8020 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

customerback innovation   itw’s customerback approach to innovation builds on the company’s 8020 business process to help itw businesses focus on the most profitable customers and invent solutions to solve their specific problems itw businesses are focused on building relationships with these major customers to develop deep knowledge and insight around their needs these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw the company actively protects its innovation through a patent portfolio of approximately 10000 active patents 

decentralized entrepreneurial culture   itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers this leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that can deliver operational excellence adapted to their customers and end markets 

key initiatives 

itw’s enterprise strategy is centered on three key initiatives  portfolio management business structure simplification and strategic sourcing these enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns 

portfolio management   the companys portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the company’s differentiated business model and growth potential as part of this initiative the company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its longterm objectives as a result the companys divestiture activity increased in 2012 2013 and 2014 with the sale of the companys former industrial packaging segment on may 1 2014 the divestiture element of the companys portfolio management initiative is essentially complete the company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms going forward the company will emphasize organic growth while acquisitions will be targeted to bolton acquisitions that support and accelerate organic growth in existing segments and new platforms that expand the company’s longterm growth and earnings potential refer to the discontinued operations note in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for discussion of the company’s discontinued operations 

another key aspect of the portfolio management initiative is the focus on product line and customer base simplification product line and customer base simplification focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines product line and customer base simplification is a core element of the companys 8020 business process in the shortterm product line and customer base simplification may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin over the longterm product line and customer base simplification results in growth in revenue profitability and returns and is key to improving the companys longterm operating and financial performance 

business structure simplification   the business structure simplification initiative simplifies the companys organizational model and adds scale to the companys operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies this initiative focuses on reducing the number of the companys operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model the company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 8020 business process to the new divisions more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure 

strategic sourcing   the companys strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness it incorporates both enterpriselevel and segmentlevel purchasing that cross the companys many businesses

 item 1a   risk factors 

the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

the companys results are impacted by global economic conditions downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses results of operations or financial condition 

the companys businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe slower economic growth financial market instability high unemployment government deficit reduction sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets we serve can adversely affect the company’s businesses by reducing demand for the companys products and services limiting financing available to the companys customers increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in 

collecting accounts receivable increasing price competition and increasing the risk that counterparties to the companys contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations 

the global nature of the companys operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business results of operations or financial condition 

the company currently operates in 57  countries the risks inherent in the companys global operations include 

 

if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the risks could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

the timing and amount of benefits from the company’s 2013  2017 enterprise initiatives may not be as expected and the companys financial results could be adversely impacted 

the company’s 2013  2017 enterprise strategy and associated initiatives include portfolio management business structure simplification and strategic sourcing the portfolio management initiative which included divesting businesses no longer aligned with the company’s longterm objectives is essentially complete however product line simplification and customer base simplification which is a core element of the company’s 8020 business process is being reapplied to the company’s scaled up operating divisions and remains an active element of this initiative although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth they may have a negative impact on the company’s overall organic revenue growth in the short term the company has made significant progress on its business structure simplification and strategic sourcing initiatives but scaling up of smaller businesses into larger businesses and leveraging purchasing power across businesses involves some execution risk if the company is unable to achieve the expected benefits from these initiatives or is unable to complete these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses the timing and amount of benefits from these initiatives may not be as expected and the companys financial results could be adversely impacted 

the timing and amount of the company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties 

share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company’s capital allocation strategy the company funds its share repurchases with free operating cash flow and shortterm borrowings the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause the company to limit suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions the price of the companys common stock the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of us cash 

the company may incur fines or penalties damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees agents or business partners violate antibribery competition export and import environmental or other laws 

the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decisionmaking autonomy within the company’s strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees agents or business partners that might violate us andor nonus laws including antibribery competition export and import and environmental laws any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations 

could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries or could damage its reputation 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the companys operating income 

although the companys financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the companys profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values and in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property its future growth may be adversely affected 

the companys ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources difficulties or delays in research development production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the companys competitive position if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation its organic growth may be adversely affected 

protecting the companys intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks andor other intellectual property rights related to many of its products and also has exclusive and nonexclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others the companys intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the companys intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the companys competitive position and results of operations 

recent divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the companys financial results 

the companys divestiture activity increased in 2012 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters 

the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

in the past the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets including significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets impairment charges could result that adversely affect the companys financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in our credit ratings could increase our funding costs or reduce the availability of credit 

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets the company’s continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets in addition the company’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by independent rating agencies if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company’s credit ratings are negatively impacted its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results

enterprise strategy 

in 2012 the company embarked on an enterprise strategy with the objective of fully leveraging itw’s core capabilities to deliver strong financial performance itw’s enterprise strategy is centered on three key initiatives  portfolio management business structure simplification and strategic sourcing these enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns 

the foundation of this strategy is a set of business practices referred to as the itw business model consisting of three core elements 

8020 business process  the concept of the 8020 business process is to focus on what is most important the 20 of the items which account for 80 of the value and to spend less time and resources on the less important the 80 of the items which account for 20 of the value the company uses this 8020 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability and as a result reduces complexity that often creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important the company utilizes the 8020 process in all aspects of its business common applications of the 8020 business process include 

 17 

the result of the application of this 8020 business process is that the company has over time improved its longterm operating and financial performance these 8020 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns 

customerback innovation   itw’s customerback approach to innovation builds on the company’s 8020 business process to help itw businesses focus on the most profitable customers and invent solutions to solve their specific problems itw businesses are focused on building relationships with these major customers to develop deep knowledge and insight around their needs these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw the company actively protects its innovation through a patent portfolio of approximately 10000 active patents 

decentralized entrepreneurial culture   itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers this leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that can deliver operational excellence adapted to their customers and end markets 

key initiatives 

itw’s enterprise strategy is centered on three key initiatives  portfolio management business structure simplification and strategic sourcing these enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns 

portfolio management   the companys portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the company’s differentiated business model and growth potential as part of this initiative the company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its longterm objectives as a result the companys divestiture activity increased in 2012 2013 and 2014 with the sale of the companys former industrial packaging segment on may 1 2014 the divestiture element of the companys portfolio management initiative is essentially complete the company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms going forward the company will emphasize organic growth while acquisitions will be targeted to bolton acquisitions that support and accelerate organic growth in existing segments and new platforms that expand the company’s longterm growth and earnings potential refer to the discontinued operations note in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for discussion of the company’s discontinued operations 

another key aspect of the portfolio management initiative is the focus on product line and customer base simplification product line and customer base simplification focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines product line and customer base simplification is a core element of the companys 8020 business process in the shortterm product line and customer base simplification may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin over the longterm product line and customer base simplification results in growth in revenue profitability and returns and is key to improving the companys longterm operating and financial performance 

business structure simplification   the business structure simplification initiative simplifies the companys organizational model and adds scale to the companys operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies this initiative focuses on reducing the number of the companys operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model the company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 8020 business process to the new divisions more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure 

strategic sourcing   the companys strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness it incorporates both enterpriselevel and segmentlevel purchasing that cross the companys many businesses

management uses working capital as a measurement of the shortterm liquidity of the company net working capital at december 31 2014  and 2013  is summarized as follows 



the increase in net working capital as of december 31 2014 was primarily due to lower current maturities of longterm debt resulting from the repayment of 10 billion of 525 euro notes in october 2014 and 800 million of 515 redeemable notes in april 2014 partially offset by a 15 billion decrease in net assets held for sale primarily related to the sale of the industrial packaging business

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company has six accounting policies that it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and in some cases on observable market information various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the companys critical accounting policies are as follows 

realizability of inventories — inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market generally the company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria 



in addition for approximately 22 of total inventories the company has elected to use the lastin firstout lifo method of inventory costing generally this method results in a lower inventory value than the firstin firstout fifo method due to the effects of inflation 

collectibility of accounts receivable — the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical writeoff percentage over the last two years in addition the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts which are also estimated based on past experience 

depreciation of plant and equipment   —  the company’s us businesses primarily compute depreciation on an accelerated basis as follows 



the majority of the companys international businesses compute depreciation on a straightline basis 

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2014  the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of  65 billion  allocated to its reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 business process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 59 million to 16 billion with the average amount equal to 461 million 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

during 2014 the society of actuaries released a new mortality table referred to as rp2014 which is believed to better reflect mortality improvements the company used the rp2014 mortality table to measure its us pension and other postretirement obligations as of december 31 2014 resulting in an increase in pension obligations of 76 million and an increase in other postretirement obligations of 46 million as of december 31 2014 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 37 million 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 4 million see the pension and other postretirement

as part of its portfolio management initiative the company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and longterm objectives as a result the companys divestiture activity increased over historical periods in 2012 and 2013 and is expected to increase further in 2014 with the planned divestiture of the industrial packaging segment divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact the companys business including the potentially dilutive effect on earnings per share distraction of managements attention from core businesses potential disputes with buyers and potential impairment charges in addition the company may be required to retain responsibility for or agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities related to the businesses sold such as lawsuits tax liabilities product liability claims and environmental matters

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the companys operating income 

although the companys financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the companys profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition

 as a result of acquisitions the company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet if the company is not able to realize the value of these assets it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets 

diminished credit availability could adversely impact the companys ability to readily obtain financing or to obtain costeffective financing 

the company may utilize the commercial paper markets for a portion of its shortterm liquidity needs if conditions in the financial markets decline there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets will remain available to the company or that the lenders participating in the companys longterm credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of its credit agreements a failure of one or more of the syndicate members in the companys credit facilities could reduce the availability of credit and adversely affect the companys liquidity if the company determines that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future funds may not be available on costeffective terms 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property its future growth may be adversely affected 

the companys ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and 

services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the companys competitive position

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

the companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses in addition the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future even if it maintains adequate insurance programs claims could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable adequate or costeffective insurance in the future

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

illinois tool works inc the “company” or “itw” is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 56 countries 

the company periodically makes changes to its management reporting structure to better align its businesses with company objectives and operating strategies effective january 1 2013 the company made certain changes in how its operations are reported to senior management in order to better align its portfolio of businesses with its enterprisewide portfolio management initiative as a result of this reorganization the companys continuing operations are internally reported as 28 operating segments to senior management as of december 31 2013  which have been aggregated into the following seven external reportable segments automotive oem test  measurement and electronics food equipment polymers  fluids welding construction products and specialty products 

the significant changes that resulted from this reorganization included the following 

 the changes in the reportable segments and underlying reporting units did not result in any goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2013 

commensurate with the change in reportable segments described above the segment operating income was also revised for a change in how the operating expenses maintained at the corporate level are allocated to the companys segments prior to january 1 2013 the company allocated all operating expenses maintained at the corporate level to its segments beginning january 1 2013 segments are allocated a fixed overhead charge based on the segments revenues expenses not charged to the segments are now reported separately as unallocated because the unallocated category includes a variety of items it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis 

the prior year segment results and related disclosures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation under the new segment structure and expense allocation methodology 

due to the large number of diverse businesses and the companys decentralized operating structure the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results instead the companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements operating revenues operating income operating margins overhead costs number of months on hand in inventory days sales outstanding in accounts receivable past due receivables and return on invested capital these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management 

management analyzes the companys consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses newly acquired and recently divested companies restructuring costs goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the companys results of operations for more than 12 months the changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue volume changes on operating income assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period as manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of nonvolume related changes in base business operating income and may be driven by a number of factors including changes in product mix the cost of raw materials labor and overhead and pricing to customers selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the companys products versus changes in the selling price to the companys customers management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segments operating margin 

8020 business process 

a key element of the company’s business strategy is its continuous 8020 business process the basic concept of this 8020 business process is to focus on what is most important the 20 of the items which account for 80 of the value and to spend less time and resources on the less important the 80 of the items which account for 20 of the value the company uses this 8020 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability and as a result reduces complexity that often creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important the company utilizes the 8020 process in various aspects of its business common applications of the 8020 business process include 

 the result of the application of this 8020 business process is that the company has over time improved its longterm operating and financial performance these 8020 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to apply this 8020 business process and improve results 

enterprise strategy 

during 2012 the company embarked on an enterprise strategy that includes three key initiatives  portfolio management business structure simplification and strategic sourcing these initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns 

portfolio management   the companys portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the companys differentiated business model and growth potential as part of this initiative the company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its longterm objectives as a result the companys divestiture activity increased over historical periods in 2012 and 2013 and is expected to increase further in 2014 with the planned divestiture of the industrial packaging segment the company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms going forward the focus will be on businesses with sustainable differentiation and growth potential refer to the discontinued operations note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for discussion of the companys discontinued operations 

business structure simplification   the business structure simplification initiative simplifies the companys organizational model and adds scale to the companys operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies this initiative focuses on reducing the number of the companys operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model the company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 8020 business process to the new divisions more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure 

strategic sourcing   the companys strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness it incorporates both enterpriselevel and segmentlevel purchasing that cross the companys many businesses this initiative is expected to transform sourcing into a core strategic function in the company

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and shortterm credit facilities in addition the company had 36 billion of cash on hand at december 31 2013 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the companys capital allocation priorities which include 

 in september 2013 the companys board of directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the industrial packaging segment the company classified the industrial packaging segment as held for sale in the third quarter of 2013 and is no longer presenting this segment as part of its continuing operations as to the impact of this divestiture on the company’s income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward the company also indicated that it intended to utilize its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiturerelated dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds free operating cash flow and additional leverage as a result the company repurchased approximately 14 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013 and expects to repurchase approximately 35 million additional shares through a program that is expected to conclude no later than the end of 2014 

on february 6 2014 the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the industrial packaging segment to the carlyle group for 32 billion the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions and is expected to close by mid2014 

the company believes that based on its revenues operating margins current free operating cash flow and credit ratings it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary 

cash flow 

the company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and debt repayment the company believes this nongaap financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the companys financial performance and measures the companys ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies 

summarized cash flow information for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  was as follows   



cash dividends paid during 2013 do not include the dividend payment of 174 million originally scheduled to be paid in january 2013 which was accelerated and paid in december 2012

adjusted return on average invested capital 

the company uses adjusted return on average invested capital “adjusted roic” to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits adjusted roic is a nongaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate roic to improve comparability of adjusted roic in the periods presented aftertax operating income excludes the operating income of the former decorative surfaces segment adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the company excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the companys operations as well as the companys net investment in the former decorative surfaces and industrial packaging segments and the equity investment in the wilsonart business average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter 

adjusted roic for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  was as follows   



adjusted roic increased 180 basis points in 2013  versus 2012  as a result of improvement in aftertax operating income of 84 and a decrease in adjusted average invested capital of 37 

adjusted roic decreased 30 basis points in 2012  versus 2011  as a result of an increase in average invested capital of 51 while aftertax operating income increased 34 

the 2013 effective tax rate included a discrete tax charge of 40 million related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings the 2012 effective tax rate included a discrete tax charge of 36 million which included 35 million for the settlement of an irs tax audit for the years 20082009 the 2011 effective tax rate included a discrete tax benefit of 166 million for an australian tax matter 

a reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate excluding the discrete tax items is as follows 



working capital 

management uses working capital as a measurement of the shortterm liquidity of the company net working capital at december 31 2013  and 2012  is summarized as follows 



the decrease in net working capital as of december 31 2013 was primarily due to current maturities of longterm debt including 10 billion of 525 euro notes due october 1 2014 and 800 million of 515 redeemable notes due april 1 2014 and a 12 billion increase in commercial paper borrowings partially offset by the reclassification of net noncurrent assets and liabilities of 11 billion to assets and liabilities held for sale 

cash and equivalents totaled approximately 36 billion as of december 31 2013  and 28 billion as of december 31 2012  primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the us cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses or used to fund new international acquisitions in the us the company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments share repurchases acquisitions servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs the company also uses its commercial paper program which is backed by longterm credit facilities of 25 billion as of december 31 2013 for shortterm liquidity needs the company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the companys commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the us 

debt 

total debt and total debt to total capitalization at december 31 2013  and 2012  were as follows 



in 2013 the company reclassified 10 billion of 525 euro notes due october 1 2014 and 800 million of 515 redeemable notes due april 1 2014 from longterm to shortterm debt 

the company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs and to fund share repurchases and small and mediumsized acquisitions the company has committed lines of credit of 25 billion in the us to support the potential issuances of commercial paper of this amount 10 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of august 15 2018 and 15 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of june 8 2017 no amounts were outstanding under these two facilities at december 31 2013  the company had outstanding commercial paper of approximately 17 billion and 408 million  at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively which is included in shortterm debt the maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2013  was 17 billion while the 

average daily balance was 576 million the increase in commercial paper resulted primarily from the funding of share repurchases during 2013 as of december 31 2013 the company’s foreign operations had authorized credit facilities of 439 million of which 12 million was outstanding and 102 million was committed for guarantees 

on january 22 2014 the company entered into a 10 billion shortterm line of credit agreement with a term of up to 364 days to provide additional liquidity under the companys commercial paper program in order to fund shortterm capital allocation needs management may also seek to refinance a portion of its shortterm debt with longer term debt during 2014 

total debt to adjusted ebitda 

the company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations the company believes that total debt to adjusted ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the companys long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda adjusted ebitda and the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense gain on sale of interest in decorative surfaces other income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis 

total debt to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  was as follows 



the companys debt to adjusted ebitda ratio increased from 17  to 21  in 2013  versus 2012  primarily due to the increase in shortterm debt related to 12 billion of additional commercial paper borrowings

the companys significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  were as follows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and in some cases on observable market information various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the companys critical accounting policies are as follows 

realizability of inventories   —  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market generally the company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria 



in addition for approximately 20 of total inventories the company has elected to use the lastin firstout “lifo” method of inventory costing generally this method results in a lower inventory value than the firstin firstout “fifo” method due to the effects of inflation 

collectibility of accounts receivable   —  the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical writeoff percentage over the last two years in addition the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts which are also estimated based on past experience 

depreciation of plant and equipment   —  the company’s us businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis as follows 



the majority of the companys international businesses compute depreciation on a straightline basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations 

income taxes   —  the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected 

levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets   —  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2013  the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of  69 billion  allocated to its reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 business simplification process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 30 million to 11 billion with the average amount equal to 246 million 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits   —  the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 31 million 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 80 for 2013 and will be 76 for 2014 a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 3 million see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions

 as a result of this reorganization the companys operations will be prospectively aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments industrial packaging test  measurement and electronics automotive oem polymers  fluids food equipment construction products welding and specialty products 

the significant changes resulting from this reorganization include the following 

 

the 2012 annual report on form 10k has not been restated for these changes in segment reporting results for 2012 and prior periods are reported on the basis under which the company managed its business in 2012 and do not reflect the january 2013 reorganization described above 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and shortterm credit facilities management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt to finance internal growth to continue to pay dividends and to fund small to mediumsized acquisitions 

the primary uses of liquidity are 

 

cash flow 

the company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends acquisitions share repurchases and debt repayment the company believes this nongaap financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the companys financial performance and measures the companys ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies 

summarized cash flow information for the three years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was as follows   



on august 20 2007 the company’s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to 30 billion of the company’s common stock over an openended period of time the “2007 program” under the 2007 program the company made repurchases of approximately 163 million shares of its common stock at an average price of 5351 per share and approximately 81 million shares of its common stock at an average price of 4329 per share during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively as of december 31 2011 there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2007 program 

on may 6 2011 the company’s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional 40 billion of the company’s common stock over an openended period of time the “2011 program” under the 2011 program the company made repurchases of approximately 18 million shares of its common stock at an average price of 4320 per share during 2011 and approximately 355 million shares of its common stock at an average price of 5693 per share during 2012 as of december 31 2012 there was approximately 19 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 program 

return on average invested capital 

the company uses return on average invested capital “roic” to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits roic is a nongaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate roic invested capital represents the net assets of the company excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the company’s operations average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter 

roic for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was as follows   



roic decreased 180 basis points in 2012 versus 2011 as a result of aftertax operating income decreasing 72 and an increase in average invested capital the decrease in aftertax operating income was due to a higher tax rate in 2012 resulting from discrete tax charges in the fourth quarter of 2012 which included the settlement of an irs tax audit for the years 20082009 versus a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2011 for an australian tax matter the fourth quarter 2012 discrete tax charges had an unfavorable 40 basis point impact on roic in 2012 

roic increased 220 basis points in 2011 versus 2010 as a result of aftertax operating income increasing 356 partially offset by an increase in average invested capital the increase in aftertax operating income was due to an increase in base business and a lower tax rate in 2011 resulting from a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2011 for an australian tax matter versus a discrete tax charge in the first quarter of 2010 for the impact of the health care reform legislation the first quarter 2011 discrete tax benefit had a favorable 140 basis point impact on roic in 2011 

working capital 

management uses working capital as a measurement of the shortterm liquidity of the company net working capital at december 31 2012 and 2011 is summarized as follows 



cash and equivalents totaled approximately 28 billion as of december 31 2012 and 12 billion as of december 31 2011 primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the us cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses or used to fund new international acquisitions in the us the company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments acquisitions share repurchases servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs the company also uses its commercial paper program which is backed by longterm credit facilities of 25 billion for shortterm liquidity needs the company believes cash generated domestically will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the us 

debt 

total debt and total debt to capitalization at december 31 2012 and 2011 were as follows 



the company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs and to fund small and mediumsized acquisitions the company has committed lines of credit of 25 billion in the us to support the potential issuances of commercial paper of this amount 10 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of june 10 2016 and 15 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of june 8 2017 no amounts were outstanding under these two facilities at december 31 2012 the company’s foreign operations also had authorized credit facilities of 337 million of which 89 million was outstanding as of december 31 2012 

the company had outstanding commercial paper of approximately 408 million and 192 million at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively which is included in shortterm debt the maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2012 was 15 billion while the average daily balance was 808 million 

in 2012 the company issued 11 billion of 39 notes due september 1 2042 at 99038 of face value the effective interest rate of the notes is 3955 these notes are senior unsecured obligations ranking equal in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the company the net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay outstanding commercial paper 

the company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow debt to capitalization ratios and credit ratings it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary 

total debt to adjusted ebitda 

the company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations the company believes that total debt to adjusted ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda adjusted ebitda and the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense gain on sale of interest in decorative surfaces other income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis 

total debt to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was as follows 



the companys debt to adjusted ebitda ratio increased from 12 to 15 in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the increase in longterm debt related to the 11 billion of 39 notes that were issued in august 2012 

stockholders’ equity 

the changes to stockholders’ equity during 2012 and 2011 were as follows 



contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 were as follows 



as of december 31 2012 the company has recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of 108 million the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2012 the company had open standby letters of credit of approximately 194 million substantially all of which expire in 2013 and 2014 the company had no other significant offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2012 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and in some cases on observable market information various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the companys critical accounting policies are as follows 

realizability of inventories   —  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market generally the company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria 



in addition for approximately 44  of the us inventories the company has elected to use the lastin firstout “lifo” method of inventory costing generally this method results in a lower inventory value than the firstin firstout “fifo” method due to the effects of inflation 

collectibility of accounts receivable   —  the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical writeoff percentage over the last two years in addition the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts which are also estimated based on past experience 

depreciation of plant and equipment   —  the company’s us businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis as follows 



the majority of the companys international businesses compute depreciation on a straightline basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations 

income taxes   —  the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets   —  the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its 40 reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2012  the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of  78 billion  allocated to its 40 reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the 

number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its 40 reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 business simplification process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately 9 million to 11 billion with the average amount equal to 195 million 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits   —  the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of us employees and many employees outside the us pension and other postretirement expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the yearend measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 36 million 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 80 for 2012 and will be 80 for 2013 a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 3 million see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

the company’s results are impacted by global economic conditions weakness or downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

during 2010 and 2011 many of our end markets showed improvement in general economic conditions but european economic conditions slowed in the second half of 2011 we cannot be assured that we will not experience adverse effects from broad economic trends in europe or other geographies instability in global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

the global nature of our operations subjects the company to political and economic risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the company currently operates in 58 countries in 2011 approximately 59 of the company’s revenues were generated from sales to customers outside of the us as the company continues to expand its global footprint these sales may represent an increasing portion of the company’s revenues the risks inherent in our global operations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial accounting managerial and operational challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may incur fines or penalties damage to our reputation or other adverse consequences if our employees agents or business partners violate antibribery or other laws 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including antibribery laws competition and export and import compliance any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income 

although the company’s financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the company’s profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

diminished credit availability could adversely impact our ability to readily obtain financing or to obtain costeffective financing 

the company may utilize the commercial paper markets for a portion of its shortterm liquidity needs if conditions in the financial markets decline there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving and longterm credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of our credit agreements a failure of one or more of the syndicate members in our credit facilities could reduce the availability of credit and adversely affect our liquidity if we determine that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future funds may not be available on costeffective terms 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins due to pricing pressure or other factors the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property its future growth may be adversely affected 

the company’s ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company’s competitive position 

protecting the company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and nonexclusive rights under patents owned by others the company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company’s competitive position and results of operations 

  

an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s growth rate 

suitable acquisitions can be difficult to complete due to high valuations for attractive acquisitions competition among prospective buyers the need for antitrust or other regulatory approval and the availability of affordable financing changes in regulatory or accounting requirements or instability in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions our ability to grow through acquisitions depends on our ability to identify and successfully complete suitable acquisitions at appropriate prices there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find attractive businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts its growth rate could be adversely affected 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions the company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

the company’s businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses in addition the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future even if it maintains adequate insurance programs successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable adequate or costeffective insurance in the future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

illinois tool works inc the “company” or “itw” is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 58 countries these businesses are internally reported as 52 operating segments to senior management the company’s 52 operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments transportation power systems  electronics industrial packaging food equipment construction products polymers  fluids decorative surfaces and all other 

due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company’s decentralized operating style the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results instead the company’s corporate management collects data on several key measurements operating revenues operating income operating margins overhead costs number of months on hand in inventory days sales outstanding in accounts receivable past due receivables and return on invested capital these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management 

the results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses newly acquired companies restructuring costs goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the company’s results of operations for more than 12 months the changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period as manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues 

a key element of the company’s business strategy is its continuous 8020 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions the basic concept of this 8020 business process is to focus on what is most important the 20 of the items which account for 80 of the value and to spend less time and resources on the less important the 80 of the items which account for 20 of the value the company’s operations use this 8020 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business and as a result reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important the company’s operations utilize the 8020 process in various aspects of their businesses common applications of the 8020 business process include 

 

  

  

  

 the result of the application of this 8020 business process is that the company has over time improved its longterm operating and financial performance these 8020 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 8020 business process and improve their results

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and shortterm credit facilities management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt to continue to pay dividends to finance internal growth and to fund small to mediumsized acquisitions 

the primary uses of liquidity are 

 

  

  

 cash flow 

the company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends acquisitions share repurchases and debt repayment the company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies 

summarized cash flow information for the three years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 was as follows 

 

   

on august 20 2007 the company’s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to 30 billion of the company’s common stock over an openended period of time the “2007 program” under the 2007 program the company made repurchases of approximately 163 million shares of its common stock at an average price of 5351 and approximately 81 million shares of its common stock at an average price of 4329 during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively as of december 31 2011 there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2007 program 

on may 6 2011 the company’s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional 40 billion of the company’s common stock over an openended period of time the “2011 program” through december 31 2011 the company made repurchases of approximately 18 million shares of its common stock at an average price of 4320 as of december 31 2011 there was approximately 39 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 program 

return on average invested capital 

the company uses return on average invested capital “roic” to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits the company believes that roic is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate roic invested capital represents the net assets of the company excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the company’s operations average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter roic for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 was as follows 

 

 the 220 basis point increase in roic in 2011 versus 2010 was the result of aftertax operating income increasing 356 primarily due to an increase in base business and a favorable tax rate partially offset by an increase in average invested capital 

the 400 basis point increase in roic in 2010 versus 2009 was the result of aftertax operating income increasing 419 primarily due to an increase in base business partially offset by a less favorable tax rate and a slight increase in average invested capital 

  

working capital 

net working capital at december 31 2011 and 2010 is summarized as follows 

 

 cash and equivalents totaled approximately 12 billion as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the united states cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses or used to fund new international acquisitions in the us the company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments acquisitions share repurchases servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs the company also uses shortterm credit facilities of 25 billion for shortterm liquidity needs the company believes cash generated domestically will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the us 

debt 

total debt at december 31 2011 and 2010 was as follows 

 

 the company issues commercial paper to fund general corporate needs and to fund small and mediumsized acquisitions the company has committed lines of credit of 25 billion in the us to support the potential issuances of commercial paper of this amount 10 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of june 10 2016 and 10 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of june 11 2013 the remaining 5000 million is provided under a revolving credit facility that terminates on june 15 2012 no amounts are outstanding under these three facilities the company’s foreign operations also have unused capacity on uncommitted facilities of approximately 329 million 

the company had outstanding commercial paper of approximately 1925 million at december 31 2011 which is included in shortterm debt and no outstanding commercial paper at december 31 2010 the maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2011 was 18 billion while the average daily balance was 7449 million

the company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow debttocapitalization ratios and credit ratings it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary the company’s targeted debttocapital ratio is 20 to 30 excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions 

total debt to ebitda 

the company uses the ratio of total debt to ebitda to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations the company believes that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda the ratio of total debt to ebitda represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense other income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis 

total debt to ebitda for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was as follows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

these critical accounting policies are as follows 

realizability of inventories — inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market generally the company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria 

 

 in addition for approximately 44 of the us inventories the company has elected to use the lastin firstout “lifo” method of inventory costing generally this method results in a lower inventory value than the firstin firstout “fifo” method due to the effects of inflation 

collectibility of accounts receivable — the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical writeoff percentage over the last two years in addition the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts which are also estimated based on past experience 

depreciation of plant and equipment — the company’s us businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis as follows 

 

 the majority of the international businesses compute depreciation on a straightline basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations 

  

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

goodwill and intangible assets – the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its 52 reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2011 the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of 74 billion allocated to its 52 reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its 52 reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and in many cases have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 business simplification process the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units range from approximately 5 million to 830 million with the average amount equal to 140 million 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

pension and other postretirement benefits – the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of us employees and many employees outside the united states pension and other postretirement expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the us primary pension plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 32 million 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 80 for 2011 and will be 80 for 2012 a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 3 million see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on how this rate is determined 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s debt 

the following table presents the company’s debt for which fair value is subject to changing market interest rates 

 

 foreign currency risk 

the company operates in the united states and 57 other countries in general the company’s products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country the initial funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the us parent company therefore the company and its subsidiaries do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies as such the company does not have any significant derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to foreign currency risk at december 31 2011 or 2010 

in october 2007 the company issued €7500 million of 525 euro notes due october 1 2014 the company has significant operations with the euro as their functional currency the company believes that the euro cash flows from these businesses will be adequate to fund the debt obligations under these notes

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

an interruption or slowdown of economic recovery in the markets served by the company could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

 

although recently most of our end markets have shown significant recovery from the global recession we cannot be certain that the recovery will continue globally as anticipated an interruption or slowdown of the economic recovery in one or more of our significant markets could have an adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

 

the global nature of our operations subjects the company to political and economic risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

the company currently operates in 57 countries in 2010 approximately 58 of the company’s revenues were generated from sales to customers outside of the united states as the company continues to expand its global footprint these sales may represent an increasing portion of the company’s revenues the risks inherent in our global operations include 

 

 8 

  

if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

 

our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital 

 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial accounting managerial and operational challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

 

  

we may incur fines or penalties damage to our reputation or other adverse consequences if our employees agents or business partners violate antibribery or other laws 

 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including antibribery laws competition and export and import compliance any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation 

 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income 

 

although the company’s financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the company’s profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

 

diminished credit availability could adversely impact our ability to readily obtain financing or to obtain costeffective financing 

 

a deterioration in world financial markets and decreases in credit availability could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing when desired or cause the cost of financing to increase 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results 

 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins due to pricing pressure or other factors the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property its future growth may be adversely affected 

 

the company’s ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company’s competitive position 

 

protecting the company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and nonexclusive rights under patents owned by others the company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company’s competitive position and results of operations 

 

an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s growth rate 

 

the company has historically followed a strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts its growth rate could be adversely affected 

 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions the company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 

 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

 

the company’s businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses in addition the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future even if it maintains adequate insurance programs successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable adequate or costeffective insurance in the future

introduction 

 

illinois tool works inc the “company” or “itw” is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 57 countries these businesses are internally reported as 60 operating segments to senior management the company’s 60 operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments transportation industrial packaging power systems  electronics food equipment construction products polymers  fluids decorative surfaces and all other 

due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company’s highly decentralized operating style the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results instead the company’s corporate management collects data on several key measurements operating revenues operating income operating margins overhead costs number of months on hand in inventory days sales outstanding in accounts receivable past due receivables and return on invested capital these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management 

 

the results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses newly acquired companies restructuring costs goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the company’s results of operations for more than 12 months the changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period as manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues 

 

a key element of the company’s business strategy is its continuous 8020 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions the basic concept of this 8020 business process is to focus on what is most important the 20 of the items which account for 80 of the value and to spend less time and resources on the less important the 80 of the items which account for 20 of the value the company’s operations use this 8020 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business and as a result reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important the company’s operations utilize the 8020 process in various aspects of their businesses common applications of the 8020 business process include 

 

  

the result of the application of this 8020 business process is that the company has over time improved its longterm operating and financial performance these 8020 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 8020 business process and improve their results

forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired the higher restructuring expenses reflected the company’s efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions improvements in base variable margins and lower overhead costs increased base margins 380 basis points in 2009 as the cumulative benefits of restructuring projects began to be realized and selling price versus material cost comparisons were favorable total margins declined by 460 basis points in 2009 primarily due to the declines in base revenues restructuring expenses and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and shortterm credit facilities management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt continue to pay dividends to finance internal growth and to fund small to mediumsized acquisitions 

 

the primary uses of liquidity are 

 

  

cash flow 

 

the company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends acquisitions share repurchases and debt repayment the company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies 

 

summarized cash flow information for the three years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was as follows 

 

 

on august 20 2007 the company’s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to 30 billion of the company’s common stock over an openended period of time through december 31 2010 the company repurchased 479 million shares of its common stock under this program at an average price of 4448 per share there are approximately 871 million of authorized repurchases remaining under this program 

 

return on average invested capital 

 

the company uses return on average invested capital “roic” to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits the company believes that roic is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate roic invested capital represents the net assets of the company excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the company’s operations average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter roic for the three years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was as follows 

 

 

 

the 460 basis point increase in roic in 2010 versus 2009 was the result of aftertax operating income increasing 470 primarily due to an increase in base business while average invested capital increased slightly 

 

the 530 basis point decrease in roic in 2009 versus 2008 was the result of aftertax operating income decreasing 385 resulting from the economic downturn while average invested capital decreased 75 

working capital

at december 31 2010 the company had open standby letters of credit of approximately 181 million substantially all of which expire in 2011 the company had no other significant offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2010 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

 

these critical accounting policies are as follows 

 

realizability of inventories  — inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market generally the company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria 

 

 

in addition for approximately half of the us inventories the company has elected to use the lastin firstout “lifo” method of inventory costing generally this method results in a lower inventory value than the firstin firstout “fifo” method due to the effects of inflation 

 

collectibility of accounts receivable — the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical writeoff percentage over the last two years in addition the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts which are also estimated based on past experience 

 

depreciation of plant and equipment — the company’s us businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis as follows 

 

 

 

the majority of the international businesses compute depreciation on a straightline basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations 

 

income taxes — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income and effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and intangible assets which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its 60 reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets 

 

in the third quarter of 2009 the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter this constituted a change in method of applying an accounting principle that the company believes is preferable the change was made to better align the timing of the company’s goodwill impairment assessment with the company’s annual business planning and forecasting process 

 

goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to continuing operations were 10 million in 2010 1056 million in 2009 and 16 million in 2008 the impairments during 2009 were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years before the recent economic downturn these charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired see the goodwill and intangible assets note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of the relative carrying values and fair values of the reporting units related to these impairment charges 

as of december 31 2010 the company had goodwill and intangible assets of 66 billion allocated to its 60 reporting units although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and intangible assets the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its 60 reporting units that have goodwill and intangible assets in addition the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and therefore have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 business simplification process the amount of goodwill and intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units range from approximately 3 million to 740 million with the average amount equal to 110 million 

 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

 

pension and other postretirement benefits — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of us employees and many employees outside the united states pension and other postretirement expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 32 million 

 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 80 for 2010 and will be 80 for 2011 a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 3 million see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on how this rate is determined

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

a downturn or further downturn in the markets served by the company could materially adversely affect results 

 

substantially all of the company’s businesses directly or indirectly serve markets that were adversely impacted by the recent global economic crisis although improvement is expected the timing of any economic recovery in the markets we serve remains uncertain a further downturn in one or more of our significant markets could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

 

the global nature of our operations subjects the company to political and economic risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

the company currently operates in 57 countries in 2009 approximately 57 of the company’s revenues were generated from sales to customers outside of the united states as the company continues to expand its global footprint these sales may represent an increasing portion of the company’s revenues the risks inherent in our global operations include 

 

 8 

  

if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

 

our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital 

 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial accounting managerial and operational challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

 

  

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

 

a significant fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income 

 

although the company’s financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the company’s profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses significant longterm fluctuations in 

relative currency values in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

 

further diminished credit availability could adversely impact our ability to readily obtain financing 

 

a further deterioration in world financial markets and decreases in credit availability could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing when desired or cause the cost of financing to increase 

 

raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results 

 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins due to pricing pressure or other factors the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property its future growth may be impaired 

 

the company’s ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company’s competitive position 

 

protecting the company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and nonexclusive rights under patents owned by others the company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company’s competitive position and results of operations 

 

an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s growth rate 

 

the company has historically followed a strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts its growth rate could be adversely affected 

 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 

potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

 

the company’s businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses in addition the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future even if it maintains adequate insurance programs successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance in the future

introduction 

 

illinois tool works inc the “company” or “itw” is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with approximately 840 operations in 57 countries these 840 businesses are internally reported as 60 operating segments to senior management the company’s 60 operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments transportation industrial packaging food equipment power systems  electronics construction products polymers  fluids decorative surfaces and all other 

 

in august 2008 the company’s board of directors authorized the divestiture of the decorative surfaces segment which was subsequently classified as a discontinued operation in may 2009 the company’s board of directors rescinded its earlier resolution to divest the decorative surfaces segment and accordingly all periods presented have been restated to present the decorative surfaces segment as a continuing operation 

 

due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company’s highly decentralized operating style the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results instead the company’s corporate management collects data on several key measurements operating revenues operating income operating margins overhead costs number of months on hand in inventory days sales outstanding in accounts receivable past due receivables and return on invested capital these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management 

 

the results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses newly acquired companies restructuring costs goodwill and intangible impairment charges and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the company’s results of operations for more than 12 months the changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period as manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues 

 

a key element of the company’s business strategy is its continuous 8020 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions the basic concept of this 8020 business process is to focus on what is most important the 20 of the items which account for 80 of the value and to spend less time and resources on the less important the 80 of the items which account for 20 of the value the company’s operations use this 8020 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business and as a result reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important the company’s 840 operations utilize the 8020 process in various aspects of their business common applications of the 8020 business process include 

 

  

the result of the application of this 8020 business process is that the company has over time improved its longterm operating and financial performance these 8020 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 8020 business process and improve their results

critical accounting policies 

 

the company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

these critical accounting policies are as follows 

 

realizability of inventories  — inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market generally the company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria 

 

 

 

in addition for approximately half of the us operations the company has elected to use the lastin firstout “lifo” method of inventory costing generally this method results in a lower inventory value than the firstin firstout “fifo” method due to the effects of inflation 

 

collectibility of accounts receivable  — the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical writeoff percentage over the last two years in addition the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts which are also estimated based on past experience 

 

depreciation of plant and equipment  — the company’s us businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis as follows 

 

 

 

the majority of the international businesses compute depreciation on a straightline basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations 

 

income taxes  — the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding among other things the level of future taxable income and effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

 

goodwill and intangible assets  — the company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the estimated fair value of its 60 reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss if any is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in calculating the fair value of the reporting units management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

in the third quarter of 2009 the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter this constitutes a change in method of applying an accounting principle that the company believes is preferable the change was made to better align the timing of the 

company’s goodwill impairment assessment with the company’s annual business planning and forecasting process 

 

as of december 31 2009 the company had goodwill and intangible assets of 66 billion allocated to its 60 reporting units the company’s risk of significant impairment charges is mitigated by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its 60 reporting units in addition the individual businesses in most of its reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time and therefore have been able to improve their performance primarily as a result of the application of the company’s 8020 business simplification process the amount of goodwill and intangibles allocated to individual reporting units range from approximately 5 million to 700 million with the average amount equal to 110 million 

 

goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges related to continuing operations were 1056 million in 2009 16 million in 2008 and 22 million in 2007 the impairment charges during 2009 were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years before the recent economic downturn these charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired see the goodwill and intangible assets note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of the relative carrying values and fair values of the reporting units related to these impairment charges 

 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company’s global end markets impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods 

 

pension and other postretirement benefits  — the company has various companysponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of us employees and many employees outside the united states pension and other postretirement expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service future compensation and age at retirement or termination important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate the expected longterm return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on highquality fixed income investments with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the us primary pension plan obligation by approximately 30 million 

 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is based on historical and expected longterm returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes for the us primary pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 85 for 2009 and will be 80 for 2010 a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 3 million see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information on how this rate is determined

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s debt 

 

the company had commercial paper outstanding of 1355 million and 18 billion as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper was 01 at december 31 2009 and 14 at december 31 2008 

 

the following table presents the company’s debt for which fair value is subject to changing market interest rates 

 

 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

the company operates in the united states and 56 other countries in general the company’s products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country the initial funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the us parent company therefore the company and its subsidiaries do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies as such the company does not have any significant derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to foreign currency risk at december 31 2009 or 2008 

 

in october 2007 the company issued €7500 million of 525 euro notes due october 1 2014 the company has significant operations with the euro as their functional currency the company believes that the euro cash flows from these businesses will be adequate to fund the debt obligations under these notes

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition the company is subject to substantially the same risk factors as other usbased global industrial manufacturers although the company 

  believes that its decentralized structure and the broad array of end markets that its businesses serve help to mitigate the possibility that any single risk factor will materially adversely affect the company’s consolidated financial position 

 

a downturn or further downturn in certain of the major markets served by the company could materially adversely affect results 

 

certain of the company’s businesses directly or indirectly serve the construction general industrial automotive or food institutionalrestaurant and service markets the current global economic crisis has caused downturns in many industrial markets and severe downturns in several markets including the construction and automotive markets there can be no assurance as to when economic conditions will improve a further or unexpectedly sustained downturn in one or more of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

 

the global nature of our operations subjects the company to political and economic risks that could adversly affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

the company currently has approximately 875 business units in 54 countries in 2008 approximately 59 of the company’s revenues were generated outside of the united states as the company continues to expand its global footprint these sales may represent an ever increasing portion of the company’s revenues the risks inherent in our global operations include 

 

  

if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

 

a significant currency fluctuation between the us dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income 

 

although the company’s financial results are reported in us dollars a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other foreign currencies with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe the company’s profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular an increase in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

 

further diminished credit availability could adversely impact our ability to readily obtain financing 

 

recent economic conditions have not materially impaired our ability to access credit or obtain appropriate financing there can be no assurance however that there will not be a further deterioration in world financial markets and decreases in credit availability such further deterioration could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing when desired or cause the cost of financing to increase 

  raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversly affect results 

 

the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins while the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material and component parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased prices to the company and the company’s ability to increase the prices of its products or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

 

if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property its future growth may be impaired 

 

the company’s ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially adversely affect the company’s competitive position 

 

protecting the company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and nonexclusive rights under patents owned by others the company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact the company’s competitive position and results of operations 

 

an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s future growth 

 

the company has historically followed a strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts its ability to continue to grow could be adversely affected 

 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition the company is subject to substantially the same risk factors as other usbased global industrial manufacturers although the company believes that its decentralized structure and the broad array of end markets that its businesses serve mitigates the possibility that any single risk factor will materially adversely effect the company’s consolidated financial position 

 

a downturn or further downturn in the major markets served by the company may adversely affect results 

 

while the company’s businesses serve a broad array of end markets a sustained downturn or further downturn in the construction general industrial automotive or food institutionalrestaurant and service markets could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operation or financial condition

 9 

   

  

if the company is unable to manage successfully the risks associated with expanding its international business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

 

unfavorable impact on raw materials which could adversely affect results 

 

the company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins while the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company’s ability to increase the prices of its products or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors 

 

the company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture their component parts in those circumstances the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

 

the company’s future growth is in part dependent upon introducing new products and preserving its intellectual property

an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s future growth 

 

the company completed 52 acquisitions in 2007 resulting in approximately 995 million of acquired annualized revenue the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts its ability to continue to grow could be adversely affected 

 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid are subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and 

  by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 

 

potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks including but not limited to those set forth below which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition the company is subject to substantially the same risk factors as other usbased global industrial manufacturers although the company believes that its decentralized structure and the broad array of end markets that its businesses serve mitigates the possibility that any single risk factor will materially adversely effect the company’s consolidated financial position 

 

a downturn in the major markets served by the company may adversely affect results 

 

while the company’s businesses serve a broad array of end markets a sustained downturn in the construction general industrial automotive or food institutional and service markets could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operation or financial condition 

 

deterioration in international and domestic business and economic conditions may have a material adverse affect on the company’s result of operations 

 

the company currently has approximately 750 business units in 49 countries in 2006 approximately 45 of the company’s revenues were generated outside of the united states as the company continues to expand its global footprint these sales will represent an ever increasing portion of the company’s revenues deterioration in either international or domestic business and economic conditions could occur as a result of a number of factors including 

 

 9 

   

  

if the company is unable to manage successfully the risks associated with expanding its international business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

 

unfavorable impact of increases in raw materials which could adversely affect results 

 

the company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and profit margins while the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company’s ability to increase the prices of its products or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors 

 

the company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture their component parts in those circumstances the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently its results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

 

the company’s future growth is in part dependent upon introducing new products and preserving its intellectual property 

 

the company’s ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially adversely affect the company’s competitive position 

 

protecting the company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and nonexclusive rights under patents owned by others the company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms unauthorized use of the company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact the company’s competitive position and results of operations 

 

an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s future growth 

 

the company completed 53 acquisitions in 2006 resulting in approximately 17 billion of acquired annualized revenue the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts its ability to continue to grow the company could be adversely affected 

 

unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results 

 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the 

  company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities 

 

potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results 

 

the company’s businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors that it uses or resells the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate insurance program consisting of a selfinsured retention and excess insurance above that layer there can be no assurance however that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance program will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities even if it maintains an adequate insurance program successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance in the future
