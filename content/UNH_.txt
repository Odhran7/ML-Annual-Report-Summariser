risks related to our business and our industry 

we are subject to risks associated with public health crises largescale medical emergencies and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic which could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and financial performance 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic continues to impact health systems businesses governments and customer and consumer activities the future impact to our business is primarily dependent upon the ultimate pacing intensity and duration of the crisis the severity of new variants of the covid19 virus and the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and treatments factors which remain uncertain at this time these factors continue to affect the related treatment testing coverage and other services we provide for the people we serve we may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care which was deferred during the pandemic and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care needs resulting from missed treatments the premiums and fees we charge including premiums dependent upon documented health conditions may not be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with covid19 and other care services similarly state and federal mandates for coverage may result in additional incurred expenses that are not associated with increases in government reimbursement such as requirements for insurers to cover athome covid19 testingwe have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for certain services optum provides to care providers health plans and employers as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from covid19 in addition our care delivery business may continue to be adversely impacted by covid19 infections and exposures affecting providers we employ resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care and related partial or full closures of our facilities our nonclinical workforce may also be adversely impacted by covid19 infections and exposures impacting our business operations 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in some of our customers having to temporarily or permanently close or severely curtail their operations and unfavorable economic conditions resulting from the pandemic may continue to impact our clients customers health care providers third party vendors and federal and state entities and programs among other impacts we have experienced and may continue to experience loss of commercial and pharmacy care services members due to customer reductions in workforce and an adverse impact on the timing and collectability of premium payments in addition governments have modified and may continue to modify regulatory standards around various aspects of health care in response to covid19 which may adversely affect our ability to ensure timely compliance and meet various contractual obligations 

further disruptions in public and private infrastructure including supply chains providing medical supplies and pharmaceutical products could disrupt our business operations or increase our operating costs additionally the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations including by restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items 

although we cannot predict the pacing intensity and duration of covid19 the pandemic’s disruption to business activities employment and economic effects and near and longterm impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system could continue to have material and adverse effects on our business results of operations financial position or cash flows 

if we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical costs or set benefit designs in an effective manner the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our riskbased benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs our optum health business negotiates valuebased arrangements with commercial thirdparty payers which are also included in premium revenues under a typical arrangement optum health receives a fixed percentage of a thirdparty payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to members premium revenues from riskbased products comprise nearly 80 of our total consolidated revenues if we fail to predict accurately or effectively price for or manage the costs of providing care under riskbased arrangements our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policies and medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences our revenue on certain medicare policies is based on bids submitted to cms in june the year before the contract year although we base the commercial and medicaid premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services largescale medical emergencies the potential effects of climate change pandemics such as covid19 the introduction of new or costly drugs treatments and technology new treatment guidelines newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2021 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1 higher than our actual medical costs without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2021 would have been reduced by approximately 330 million excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum mlrs 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove inaccurate our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate integrate upgrade or expand our existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our business depends on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members customers and health care professionals and to operate our business the volume of health care data generated and the uses of data including electronic health records are rapidly expanding our ability to implement new and innovative services price adequately our products and services provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems in addition connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could experience failures in our health wellness and information technology products lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 

we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems’ capabilities enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to health data and the health information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in security breaches disrupting our operations or resulting in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential 

information we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including protected personal information subject to privacy security or data breach notification laws as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the united states due to our information technology systems and international business operations we are regularly the target of attempted cyberattacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use we have programs in place which are intended to detect contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding phishing malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication we may be unable to anticipate these techniques detect breaches for long periods of time or implement adequate preventive measures experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns negatively affecting our operations they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs attacking our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise information security in addition we are subject to heightened vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks associated with increased numbers of employees working from home our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft coordinated attacks by activist entities financial fraud schemes misplaced or lost data human error malicious social engineering or other events which could negatively affect our systems our customers’ data proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties or our operations in certain circumstances we may rely on thirdparty vendors to process store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be material our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and liability including regulatory penalties for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate in particular geographies or segments our competitors compared to us may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements better existing business relationships lower profit margin or financial return expectations or other factors which give such competitors a competitive advantage our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability 

in addition our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services which are useful and relevant to health care payers consumers and our customers we may not remain competitive and we risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants for example new directtoconsumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage we may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants which could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas any failure by us to continue to develop innovative care models including accelerating the transition of care to valuebased models and expanding access to virtual care could result in competitive disadvantages and loss of market share additionally our competitive position could be adversely affected by a failure to develop satisfactory data and analytics capabilities or provide services focused on these capabilities to our clients our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we fail to realize competitive advantages resulting from collaboration between our businesses if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services demonstrating value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or 

demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers physicians hospitals and other service providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care payers as a service provider to those payers as well as physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain activities related to network design provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes which may be costly divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physician and hospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies which could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition acos practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and other organizational structures adopted by physicians hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

our health care benefits businesses have riskbased arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers these arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent a riskbased health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers render services to our members who do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in other cases the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard which does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us 

the success of some of our businesses including optum health and unitedhealthcare global depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees independent contractors or joint venture partners the physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us we face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians or to acquire recruit or in some instances employ physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of unitedhealthcare our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies or fail to adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely subject to various legal actions which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other matters the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort claims including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities or by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks including as a result of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical quality andor patient safety standards antitrust claims including as a result of changes in the enforcement of antitrust laws whistleblower claims including claims under the false claims act or similar statutes contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices in addition certain of our pharmacy services operations are subject to the clinical quality patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing packaging and distribution of drugs including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors we may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers we operate in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded additionally physicians and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional liabilities even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such actions litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs and if these actions are asserted against us could result in substantial monetary damages or damage to our reputation 

we cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses 

any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the united states could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to medicare beneficiaries if we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions which further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment and culture or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage in addition even with appropriate diligence preacquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal challenges and investigations for example in january 2021 an indictment for alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the doj against our subsidiary surgical care affiliates sca based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five years prior to our acquisition we are vigorously defending this lawsuit but if sca is found liable we may be subject to criminal fines or reputational harm if we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities 

and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we expand and operate our business outside of the united states we are presented with challenges differing from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets languages business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses these challenges vary widely by country and outside of the united states may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions which could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to manage successfully our nonus acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and our future revenues costs and cash flows from international operations any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commission levels 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment during the early stages of the covid19 pandemic has caused lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group benefits and pharmacy services plans unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services these conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our failure to attract develop retain and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business results of operations and future performance 

we are dependent on our ability to attract develop and retain qualified employees and executives including those with diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets to operate and expand our business experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is extremely competitive we may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business adverse changes to our corporate culture which seeks to foster integrity compassion relationships innovation and performance could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives while we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives these plans do not guarantee the services of our key employees and executives 

will continue to be available to us if we are unable to attract develop retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives our business results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2021 relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity 

our investments may not produce total positive returns and we may sell investments at prices which are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

as of december 31 2021 our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of 86 billion representing 40 of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses we acquire perform in a manner inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in equity could in turn adversely affect our credit ratings 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases software and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings in the future any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs 

risks related to the regulation of our business 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business 

we are regulated by federal state and local governments in the united states and other countries where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct 

business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements under state guaranty association laws certain insurance companies can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies which write the same line or similar lines of business any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations 

certain of our businesses provide products or services to government agencies for example some of our optum and unitedhealthcare businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and non us selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts among others certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies which might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest these laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers these regulations include state telemedicine regulations debt collection laws banking regulations distributor and producer licensing requirements state corporate practice of medicine doctrines feesplitting rules and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change for example legislative administrative and public policy changes to the aca have been and likely will continue to be considered and we cannot predict if the aca will be further modified litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the aca in whole or in part and future litigation challenges are possible further the integration into our businesses of entities we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us including by subjecting us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to hhs for monitoring purposes geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business these regulatory regimes encompass among other matters local and crossborder taxation licensing tariffs intellectual property investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements management control labor antifraud anticorruption and privacy and data protection regulations including requirements for crossborder data transfers which vary by jurisdiction we currently operate outside of the united states and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states increasing our exposure to nonus regulatory regimes for example our unitedhealthcare global business subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans the agência nacional de saúde suplementar while our banmédica business is subject to chilean colombian and peruvian laws regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations which could differ from the approach taken by us regulators in addition our nonus businesses and operations are subject to us laws regulating the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the fcpa which prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely 

affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs and chip and receive substantial revenues from these programs certain of our optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or termination of the contract at the option of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are possible in addition from time to time cms makes changes to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payments although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the medicare advantage program in addition payers in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from cms as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit states have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and will not have additional members autoassigned to us in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors if any of these assumptions is materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of the aca cms has a system providing various quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including among others quality of care preventive services chronic illness management handling of appeals and customer satisfaction plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans our membership levels results of operations financial position and cash flows any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs including medicare and medicaid or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for medicare advantage plans as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits which in the past have resulted and in the future could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms 

we have been and in the future may become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments such investigations audits reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers who among other allegations may claim we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false or erroneous claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which have resulted in and in the future could result in adverse publicity the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses 

we provide pharmacy care services through our optum rx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies additionally various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain pbm practices which have resulted in other pbms agreeing to civil penalties including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements as a provider of pharmacy benefit management services optum rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure registration and other laws and accreditation standards optum rx also conducts business through home delivery specialty and compounding pharmacies pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those of the dea and individual state controlled substance authorities the food and drug administration fda and boards of pharmacy 

we could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery specialty or compounding or clinicbased pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions from any of our home delivery specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to erisa a private party or the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations if a court were to determine fiduciary obligations apply we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into certain prohibited transactions 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and addressed in requirements imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations 

internationally many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply we expect there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations 

and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the european union brazil chile india and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers for example effective may 2018 the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr overhauled data protection laws in the european union gdpr has imposed more stringent european union data protection requirements on us or our customers and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance brazilian privacy legislation similar in certain respects to gdpr took effect in september 2020 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data 

hipaa requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs administers its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our optum businesses we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically deidentified in accordance with hipaa standards noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and among other consequences could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary in most states we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

executive overview 

general 

unitedhealth group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone our two complementary businesses — optum and unitedhealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access affordability experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve 

we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms optum and unitedhealthcare 

• optum health 

• optum insight 

• optum rx and 

• unitedhealthcare which includes unitedhealthcare employer  individual unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement unitedhealthcare community  state and unitedhealthcare global 

further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in part i item 1 “business” and in note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  ” 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the united states south america and certain other international health markets in the united states health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18 of gross domestic product gdp we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions such as the economic impact of covid19 and regulatory changes which could impact our results of operations including our continued efforts to control health care costs 

pricing trends to price our health care benefit products we start with our view of expected future costs including any potential impacts from covid19 we frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve considering relevant factors such as product positioning price competitiveness and environmental competitive legislative and regulatory considerations including minimum mlr thresholds we will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions 

the commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group large group and individual segments we expect broadbased competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs 

medicare advantage funding continues to be pressured as discussed below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties” 

we expect medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and pricing trends we also believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on medicaid margin percentages we continue to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships we continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the longterm viability of their programs 

medical cost trends our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs health system utilization and prescription drug costs covid19 related care costs as well as the deferral of care have impacted medical cost trends in 2021 and may continue to do so in 2022 and subsequent years future medical cost trends may be impacted by increased consumer demand for care potentially even higher acuity care due to the temporary deferral of care since the onset of the pandemic we endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices with the objective of helping them achieve highquality affordable care the continued uncertain impact of covid19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable which has resulted in and could continue to result in increased variability to medical cost reserve development 

delivery system and payment modernization the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality improve the health of populations and reduce costs we continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying performancebased care provider payment models rewarding highquality affordable care and foster collaboration we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients 

this trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician including new primary care channels and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems which we believe provide growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to regulatory matters for additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties see part i item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 1a “risk factors” 

medicare advantage rates final 2022 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 41 short of the industry forward medical cost trend creating continued pressure in the medicare advantage program 

the ongoing medicare advantage funding pressure places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency there are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions in some years these adjustments impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks adjust members benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government additionally we decide annually on a countybycounty basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans 

our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings the level of star ratings from cms based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses 

aca tax health insurance tax the health insurance tax was permanently repealed by congress effective january 1 2021 the permanent repeal of the tax impacts yearoveryear comparability of our financial statements including revenues operating costs medical care ratio mcr operating cost ratio effective tax rate and cash flows from operations 

covid19 trends and uncertainties 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain in 2021 overall care activity continued to increase including a mix of temporary deferral of care activity and covid19 related care costs the temporary deferral of care was more than offset by covid19 related care and testing costs rebate requirements and other revenue impacts and general economic impacts in future periods care patterns may moderately exceed normal baselines as previously deferred care is obtained and acuity temporarily rises due to missed regular care from time to time health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows 

optum covid19 related care costs continued to impact our optum health valuebased care delivery businesses which were partially offset by the continued temporary deferral of care the temporary deferral of care reduced feeforservice care delivery volume as well as optum insight and optum rx volumebased business activity although we expect the impact to continue decreasing as care returns to and potentially exceeds normal levels we believe covid19 will continue to influence customer and consumer behavior both during and after the pandemic which could impact how and where care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services as a result of the dynamic situation and broadreaching impact to the health system the ultimate impact of covid19 on our optum businesses is uncertain 

unitedhealthcare in 2021 we continued expanded benefit coverage in areas such as covid19 related care and testing telemedicine and pharmacy we also continued to assist our customers care providers members and communities in addressing the covid19 crisis unitedhealthcare’s 2021 results of operations were negatively impacted by covid19 related care and testing rebate requirements and other revenue impacts as well as broader economic impacts partially offset by the continued deferral of care the increase in people served through medicaid was attributable in part to continuing action by states to ease eligibility redetermination requirements due to the covid19 public health emergency 

disrupted care patterns as a result of the pandemic have affected and may continue to temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information impacting revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies the ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing intensity and duration of the pandemic the severity of new variants of the covid19 virus the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccination and treatments and general economic uncertainty

our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 80 billion and 83 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of longterm debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



2021 cash flows compared to 2020 cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities were largely consistent with higher net earnings being offset by changes in working capital accounts other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included decreased customer funds administered and increased purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests share repurchases and cash dividends paid partially offset by decreased cash paid for acquisitions and net purchases of investments 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2021 our cash cash equivalent availableforsale debt securities and equity securities balances of 651 billion included 214 billion of cash and cash equivalents of which 28 billion was available for general corporate use 402 billion of debt securities and 35 billion of equity securities given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements 

our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 39 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “double a” as of december 31 2021 when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

cash requirements the company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable accounts payable and accrued liabilities shortterm borrowings and current maturities of longterm debt other current liabilities and purchase commitments and other obligations we expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations cash available for general corporate use and the realization of current assets such as accounts receivable 

our longterm cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include 

• debt obligations see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” for further detail of our longterm debt and the timing of expected future payments interest coupon payments are typically paid semiannually 

• operating leases see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments 

• purchase and other obligations these include 47 billion 27 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments these amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2021 

• other liabilities these include other longterm liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2021 including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs unrecognized tax benefits and various longterm liabilities which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments 

• redeemable noncontrolling interests see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” for further detail we do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months 

we expect the cash required to meet our longterm obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations however we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and longterm requirements through the issuance of commercial paper issuance of longterm debt or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments we believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future shortterm and longterm liquidity needs 

shortterm borrowings our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent brokerdealers and are available for general corporate purposes for more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  ” 

our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60 subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement as of december 31 2021 our debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was 36 

longterm debt periodically we access capital markets to issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes such as to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases for more information on our debt see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  ” 

credit ratings our credit ratings as of december 31 2021 were as follows 



the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 

share repurchase program as of december 31 2021 we had board authorization to purchase up to 45 million shares of our common stock for more information on our share repurchase program see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  ” 

dividends in june 2021 the company’s board of directors increased the company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of 580 compared to 500 per share which the company had paid since june 2020 for more information on our dividend see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  ” 

pending acquisitions in 2021 we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector most notably change healthcare nasdaq chng subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions additionally in january 2022 we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions the total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness is approximately 12 billion 

we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations which include internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service approximately 90 of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months as of december 31 2021 our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period 

in each reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2021 2020 and 2019 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 17 billion 880 million and 580 million respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example for the most recent two months we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors 

completion factors a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service 

to claim receipt claim levels and processing cycles as well as other factors our judgments also consider the impacts of covid19 on these factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2021 



medical cost per member per month trend factors medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators which included consideration of covid19 these factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as gdp growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices and catastrophes epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of december 31 2021 



the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2021 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2021 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2021 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately 184 million 

for more detail related to our medical cost estimates see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill for impairment we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value during a qualitative analysis we consider the impact of changes if any to the following factors macroeconomic industry and market factors cost 

factors changes in overall financial performance and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit if our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform additional quantitative analyses we may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment is recognized for the difference up to the carrying amount of goodwill 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a marketbased method the discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow including revenue trends medical costs trends operating productivity income taxes and capital levels longterm growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates financial projections and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategies discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unitspecific factors we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future additionally as part of our quantitative impairment testing we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions such as discount rates cash flow projections and peer company multiples to analyze the potential for a material impact the marketbased method requires determination of an appropriate peer group whose securities are traded on an active market the peer group is used to derive market multiples to estimate fair value as of october 1 2021 we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base as of december 31 2021 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real and chilean peso 

as of december 31 2021 we had 25 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may significantly impact our investment income also as of december 31 2021 7 billion of our financial liabilities which include debt and deposit liabilities were at interest rates which vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2021 37 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 45 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixedincome market sectors and debt across maturities as well as by matching a portion of our floatingrate assets and liabilities either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts unrealized gains and losses on investments in availableforsale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 point or 2 points as of december 31 2021 and 2020 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 



note given the low absolute level of shortterm market rates on our floatingrate assets and liabilities as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero as of december 31 2021 and 2020 some of our investments had interest rates below 2 so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction 

we have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies primarily the brazilian real and the chilean peso to the us dollar in translation of unitedhealthcare global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and unitedhealthcare global’s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into us dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real or chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies for example as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 and 25 increase in the value of the us dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately 520 million and 11 billion respectively we manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies 

as of december 31 2021 we had  35 billion of investments in equity securities primarily consisting of investments in employee savings plan related investments other venture investments and nonus dollar fixedincome funds valuations in nonus dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates

risks related to our business and our industry 

we are subject to risks associated with public health crises largescale medical emergencies and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and financial performance 

the ongoing covid19 global health crisis continues to have major impacts on health systems businesses governments and customer and consumer activities we have mobilized the full strength of our resources to deliver the best care for patients support for our members and care provider partners keep our employees safe and deliver innovative solutions and support for the communities we serve and the entire health system the impact to our business is primarily dependent upon the ultimate pacing intensity and duration of the crisis and the timing for widespread availability and effectiveness of a vaccine factors which remain uncertain at this time these factors continue to affect the related treatment testing coverage and other services we provide for the people we serve as the crisis abates we may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care which was deferred during the pandemic and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care needs resulting from missed treatments the premiums and fees we charge including premiums dependent upon documented health conditions may not be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with covid19 and other care services in addition we have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for certain services optum provides to care providers health plans and employers as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in our customers having to close or severely curtail their operations among other impacts we have experienced and may continue to experience loss of commercial and pharmacy care services members due to customer reductions in workforce and an adverse impact on the timing and collectability of premium payments in addition governments have modified and may continue to modify regulatory standards around various aspects of health care in response to covid19 and these changing standards may create challenges for us to ensure timely compliance and meet various contractual obligations 

further disruptions in public and private infrastructure including supply chains providing medical supplies and pharmaceutical products could adversely disrupt our business operations or increase our operating costs additionally the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations including restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items 

although we cannot predict the pacing intensity and duration of covid19 the pandemic’s disruption to business activities employment and economic effects and near and longterm impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system could continue to have material and adverse effects on our business results of operations financial position or cash flows 

if we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our riskbased benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs our optumhealth business negotiates riskbased arrangements with commercial thirdparty payers which are also included in premium revenues under a typical arrangement optumhealth receives a fixed percentage of a thirdparty payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to members premium revenues from riskbased products comprise nearly 80 of our total consolidated revenues if we fail to predict accurately or effectively price for or manage the costs of providing care under riskbased arrangements our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policies and medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted to cms in june the year before the contract year although we base the commercial and medicaid premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services largescale medical emergencies pandemics such as covid19 the introduction of new or costly drugs treatments and technology new treatment guidelines new mandated benefits such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or 

utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2020 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1 higher than our actual medical costs without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2020 would have been reduced by approximately 290 million excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum mlrs 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove inaccurate our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate integrate upgrade or expand our existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is highly dependent on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members customers and health care professionals and to operate our business the volume of health care data generated and the uses of data including electronic health records are rapidly expanding our ability to implement new and innovative services price adequately our products and services provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems in addition connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could experience failures in our health wellness and information technology products lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 

we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems’ capabilities enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to health data and the health information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in security breaches disrupting our operations or resulting in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including protected personal information subject to privacy security or data breach notification laws as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the united states due to our information technology systems and international business operations we are regularly the target of attempted cyberattacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use we have programs in place which are intended to detect contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding phishing malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication we may be unable to anticipate these techniques detect breaches for long periods of time or implement adequate preventive measures experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or 

confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns negatively affecting our operations they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs attacking our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise information security in addition we are subject to heightened vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks associated with increased numbers of employees working from home our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft coordinated attacks by activist entities financial fraud schemes misplaced or lost data human error malicious social engineering or other events which could negatively affect our systems our customers’ data proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties or our operations in certain circumstances we may rely on thirdparty vendors to process store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be material our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and liability including regulatory penalties for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states south america and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate in particular geographies or segments our competitors compared to us may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements better existing business relationships lower profit margin or financial return expectations or other factors which give such competitors a competitive advantage our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability 

in addition our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services which are useful and relevant to consumers and our customers we may not remain competitive and we risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants for example new directtoconsumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage we may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants which could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas any failure by us to continue to develop innovative care models could result in competitive disadvantages and loss of market share our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services demonstrating value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other service providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain activities related to network design provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes which may be costly divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physician and hospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies which could result 

in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition acos practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and other organizational structures adopted by physicians hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

our health care benefits businesses have riskbased arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers these arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent a riskbased health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers render services to our members who do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard which does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 

the success of some of our businesses including optumhealth and unitedhealthcare global depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees independent contractors or joint venture partners the physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us we face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians or to acquire recruit or in some instances employ physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of unitedhealthcare our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies or fail to adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely subject to various legal actions due to the nature of our business which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other matters the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort claims including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities or by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks whistleblower claims including claims under the false claims act or similar statutes contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers in addition we operate in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks while we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance although we record 

liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

we cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses 

any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the united states could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to medicare beneficiaries if we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions which further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment and culture or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage in addition even with appropriate diligence preacquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal challenges and investigations for example in january 2021 an indictment for alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the doj against our subsidiary surgical care affiliates sca based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five years prior to our acquisition we are vigorously defending this lawsuit but if sca is found liable we may be subject to criminal fines or reputational harm if we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we expand and operate our business outside of the united states we are presented with challenges differing from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets languages business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses these challenges vary widely by country and outside of the united states may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions which could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to manage successfully our nonus acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and our future revenues costs and cash flows from international operations any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commission levels 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment has caused lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group benefits and pharmacy services 

plans unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services these conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our failure to attract develop retain and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business results of operations and future performance 

we are dependent on our ability to attract develop and retain qualified employees and executives including those with diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets to operate and expand our business experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is extremely competitive we may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business in addition we believe our corporate culture fosters integrity compassion relationships innovation and performance adverse changes to our corporate culture could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives while we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives these plans do not guarantee the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us if we are unable to attract develop retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives our business results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2020 relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity 

there can be no assurance our investments will produce total positive returns or we will not sell investments at prices which are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

as of december 31 2020 our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of 82 billion representing 42 of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses we acquire perform in a manner inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in equity could in turn adversely affect our credit ratings 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases software and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders there can be no assurance our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs 

risks related to the regulation of our business 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business 

we are regulated by federal state and local governments in the united states and other countries where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements under state guaranty association laws certain insurance companies can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies who write the same line or similar lines of business any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations 

certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies for example some of our optum and unitedhealthcare businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and non us selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts among others certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies which might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest these laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers these regulations include state telemedicine regulations debt collection laws banking regulations distributor and producer licensing requirements state corporate practice of medicine doctrines feesplitting rules and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change for example legislative administrative and public policy changes to the aca are being considered and we cannot predict if the aca will be further modified litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the aca in whole or in part a federal appeals court struck down the aca as in part unconstitutional in 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2020 the supreme court heard oral arguments in the case further the integration into our businesses of entities we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us including by subjecting us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to hhs for monitoring purposes geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business these regulatory regimes encompass among other matters local and crossborder taxation licensing tariffs intellectual property investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements management control labor antifraud anticorruption and privacy and data protection regulations including requirements for crossborder data transfers which vary by jurisdiction we currently operate outside of the united states and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states increasing our exposure to nonus regulatory regimes for example our unitedhealthcare global business subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans the agência nacional de saúde suplementar while our banmédica business is subject to chilean colombian and peruvian laws regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations which could differ from the approach taken by us regulators in addition our nonus businesses and operations are subject to us laws regulating the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the fcpa which prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs and chip and receive substantial revenues from these programs certain of our optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or termination of the contract at the option of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are possible in addition from time to time cms makes changes to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payments although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the medicare advantage program in addition payers in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from cms as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and will not have additional members autoassigned to us in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors if any of these assumptions is materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of the aca cms has a system providing various quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including among others quality of care preventive services chronic illness management handling of appeals and customer satisfaction plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans our membership levels results of operations financial position and cash flows any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs including medicare and medicaid or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for medicare advantage plans as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits which in the past have resulted and in the future could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms 

we have been and may in the future become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments such investigations audits reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers who among other allegations we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false or erroneous claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which have resulted in and in the future could result in adverse publicity the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses 

we provide pharmacy care services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies additionally various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain pbm practices which have resulted in other pbms agreeing to civil penalties including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements as a provider of pharmacy benefit management services optumrx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure registration and other laws and accreditation standards impacting the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager optumrx also conducts business through home delivery specialty and compounding pharmacies pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those of the dea and individual state controlled substance authorities the food and drug administration fda and boards of pharmacy 

we could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery specialty or compounding or clinicbased pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions from any of our home delivery specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to erisa a private party or the dol which is the agency who enforces erisa could assert the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations if a court were to determine fiduciary obligations apply we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into certain prohibited transactions 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of protected personal information is regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations 

internationally many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply we expect there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the european union brazil chile india and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers for example effective may 2018 the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr overhauled data protection laws in the european union the new regulation superseded prior european union privacy and data protection legislation imposed more stringent european union data protection requirements on us or our customers and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance brazilian privacy legislation similar in certain respects to gdpr took effect in august 2020 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data 

hipaa requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs administers its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our optum businesses including our optum labs business we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically deidentified in accordance with hipaa standards noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or 

other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and among other consequences could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary in most states we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

covid19 trends and uncertainties 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain during the second quarter the global health system experienced unprecedented levels of care deferral which impacted all of our businesses as the pandemic advanced access to and demand for care was most constrained from midmarch through april began to recover in may and june and restored to near normal seasonal levels in the third quarter care patterns continued to normalize in the fourth quarter returning to and even exceeding seasonal baselines including covid19 treatment and testing costs towards the end of the quarter the temporary deferral of care experienced in 2020 may cause care patterns to moderately exceed normal baselines in future periods as utilization of health system capacity continues to increase from time to time health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows 

optum the temporary deferral of care impacted the optum businesses for the year ended december 31 2020 for example our feeforservice care delivery business such as traditional procedure work at our ambulatory surgery centers was negatively impacted while our riskbased care delivery business performance reflected lower demand for care our optuminsight and optumrx volumebased businesses were negatively impacted by the lower level of care encounters which took place as well as by broader economic factors contributing to lower managed services and prescription volume as the health system returned to normal seasonally adjusted levels of care we have seen business activity approach normal levels covid19 will also continue to influence customer and consumer behavior both during and after the pandemic which could impact how care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services the impact of covid19 on our care provider and payer clients could impact the volume and types of services optum provides as well as the pacing of potential new business opportunities as a result of the dynamic situation and broadreaching impact to the health system the ultimate impact of covid19 on our optum businesses is uncertain 

unitedhealthcare during 2020 we expanded benefit coverage in areas such as covid19 care and testing telemedicine and pharmacy benefits provided customers assistance in the form of copay waivers and premium forgiveness offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employersponsored offerings extended certain premium payment terms for customers experiencing financial hardship simplified administrative practices and accelerated payments to care providers all with the aim of assisting our customers care providers members and communities in addressing the covid19 crisis temporary care deferrals significantly impacted unitedhealthcare’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 the impact of temporary care deferrals was offset by covid19 related care and testing the significant financial assistance we provided our customers rebate requirements and broader economic impacts enrollment in our commercial products declined primarily due to employer actions in response to the pandemic 

increased consumer demand for care potentially even higher acuity care along with continued covid19 care and testing costs are expected to result in increased future medical costs disrupted care patterns as a result of the pandemic may temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information impacting future revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies the ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing and intensity of the pandemic the duration of policies and initiatives to address covid19 and general economic uncertainty 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the united states south america and certain other international health markets in the united states health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18 of gross domestic product gdp we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions such as the economic impact of covid19 and regulatory changes which could impact our results of operations including our continued efforts to control health care costs 

pricing trends to price our health care benefit products we start with our view of expected future costs including any potential impacts from covid19 we frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve considering relevant factors such as product positioning price competitiveness and environmental competitive legislative and regulatory considerations including minimum mlr thresholds we will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions 

the commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments we expect broadbased competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs the aca had an annual nondeductible insurance industry tax health insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for riskbased health insurance products pricing for contracts covering some portion of calendar year 2021 reflected the permanent repeal of the health insurance industry tax 

medicare advantage funding continues to be pressured as discussed below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties” 

we expect medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve we also believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on medicaid margin percentages we continue to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships we continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states who are committed to the longterm viability of their programs 

medical cost trends our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs health system utilization and prescription drug costs covid19 care and testing costs and certain of our customer assistance initiatives have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years we endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices with the objective of helping them achieve highquality affordable care the uncertain impact of covid19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable which could result in increased variability to medical cost reserve development in future periods 

delivery system and payment modernization the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality improve the health of populations and reduce costs we continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying performancebased care provider payment models rewarding highquality affordable care and foster collaboration we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients 

we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and costefficiency as of december 31 2020 we served nearly 18 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement including fullrisk sharedrisk and bundled episodeofcare and performance incentive payment approaches 

this trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician including new primary care channels and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems which we believe provide growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the aca and other regulatory matters for additional information regarding the aca and regulatory trends and uncertainties see part i item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 1a “risk factors” 

medicare advantage rates final 2021 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 17 short of the industry forward medical cost trend creating continued pressure in the medicare advantage program 

the ongoing medicare advantage funding pressure places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency there are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions in some years these adjustments impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks adjust members benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government additionally we decide annually on a countybycounty basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans 

our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings the level of star ratings from cms based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses 

aca tax after a moratorium in 2019 the industrywide amount of the health insurance industry tax for 2020 which was primarily borne by customers was 155 billion with our portion being approximately 30 billion the return of the tax impacted yearoveryear comparability of our financial statements including revenues operating costs medical care ratio mcr operating cost ratio effective tax rate and cash flows from operations the health insurance industry tax was permanently repealed by congress effective january 1 2021

2020 results of operations compared to 2019 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenue 

the increases in revenue were primarily driven by the increase in the number of individuals served through medicare advantage and medicaid pricing trends and organic and acquisition growth across the optum business primarily due to expansion in pharmacy care services and care delivery the increases were partially offset by decreased individuals served through our commercial and global benefits businesses certain voluntary customer assistance programs and rebate requirements revenues were also negatively impacted by decreases in our feeforservice care delivery and other volumebased businesses primarily as a result of the care deferral and economic impacts of covid19 

medical costs and mcr 

medical costs increased as a result of growth in people served through medicare advantage and medicaid medical cost trends and covid19 care and testing costs partially offset by decreased people served in commercial and global modestly lower care patterns and increased prior year favorable development the mcr decreased primarily due to the temporary deferral of care and the revenue effects of the return of the health insurance industry tax partially offset by covid19 care and testing costs rebate requirements and voluntary customer assistance measures 

operating cost ratio 

the operating cost ratio increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the health insurance industry tax covid19 response efforts and business mix partially offset by operating efficiency gains 

income tax rate 

our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax 

reportable segments 

see note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements ” for more information on our segments we utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments including individuals served by unitedhealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement people served by optumhealth and adjusted scripts for optumrx these metrics are the main drivers of revenue earnings and cash flows at each business the metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment 

the following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information 



unitedhealthcare 

the following table summarizes unitedhealthcare revenues by business 



the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our unitedhealthcare businesses by major market segment and funding arrangement 



feebased and riskbased commercial business decreased primarily due to increased unemployment and related attrition medicare advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual medicare advantage plans the increase in people served through medicaid was primarily driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to covid19 and growth in people served via dual special needs plans the decrease in people served by unitedhealthcare global is a result of increased unemployment and underwriting discipline 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through medicare advantage and medicaid a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs and the return of the health insurance industry tax partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through the commercial and global businesses and foreign currency impacts in 2020 earnings from operations increased due to the deferral of care caused by covid19 on the health system and the factors impacting revenue partially offset by the return of the health insurance industry tax covid19 care and testing costs customer assistance programs and broader economic effects 

optum 

total revenues increased as each segment reported revenue growth earnings from operations increased due to growth at optumhealth and optuminsight 

the results by segment were as follows 

optumhealth 

revenue and earnings at optumhealth increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in riskbased care delivery reduced care volumes in feeforservice arrangements as a result of covid19 partially offset the increases in revenues and earnings optumhealth served approximately 98 million people as of december 31 2020 compared to 96 million people as of december 31 2019 

optuminsight 

revenue and earnings from operations at optuminsight increased primarily due to growth in technology and managed services partially offset by decreased activity levels in volumebased services due to the impact of covid19 on payer and care provider clients 

optumrx 

revenue at optumrx and the corresponding eliminations increased due to the inclusion of retail pharmacy copayments see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements  for further detail revenue at optumrx also increased due to organic and acquisition growth in pharmacy care services including specialty pharmacy and new client wins partially offset by an expected large client transition and lower script volumes driven by covid19 related care deferral and fewer people served due to economicdriven employment attrition earnings from operations remained relatively flat as covid19 impacts were partially offset by the factors impacting revenue and improved 

supply chain management optumrx fulfilled 13 billion adjusted scripts in both 2020 and 2019 with growth offset by the large client transition 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the shortterm and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to among other things minimal levels of statutory capital as defined by their respective jurisdiction and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies 

our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 83 billion and 56 billion in 2020 and 2019 respectively see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements ” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of longterm debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



2020 cash flows compared to 2019 cash flows 

increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings as well as changes in working capital accounts other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included an increase in customer funds administered and net purchases of investments and decreases in net issuances of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings cash paid for acquisitions and share repurchases 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2020 our cash cash equivalent availableforsale debt securities and equity securities balances of 590 billion included 169 billion of cash and cash equivalents of which 13 billion was available for general corporate use 398 billion of debt securities and 23 billion of equity securities given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements ” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements 

our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 37 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “double a” as of december 31 2020 when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

cash requirements the company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable accounts payable and accrued liabilities commercial paper and current maturities of longterm debt other current liabilities and purchase commitments and other obligations we expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations cash available for general corporate use and the realization of current assets such as accounts receivable 

our longterm cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include 

• debt obligations see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  i tem 8  “ financial statements ” for further detail of our commercial paper and longterm debt and the timing of expected future payments interest coupon payments are typically paid semiannually 

• operating leases see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements ” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments 

• purchase and other obligations these include 53 billion 20 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments these amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2020

• redeemable noncontrolling interests see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements ” for further detail we do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months 

we expect the cash required to meet our longterm obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations however we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and longterm requirements through the issuance of commercial paper issuance of longterm debt or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments we believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future shortterm and longterm liquidity needs

credit ratings our credit ratings as of december 31 2020 were as follows 



the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 

share repurchase program as of december 31 2020 we had board authorization to purchase up to 58 million shares of our common stock for more information on our share repurchase program see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements ”

recently issued accounting standards 

see note 2 of t he notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements ” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements which affect us 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service approximately 90 of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months as of december 31 2020 our days outstanding in medical payables was 48 days calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period 

in each reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2020 2019 and 2018 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 880 million 580 million and 320 million respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example for the most recent two months we estimate claim costs incurred by applying 

observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors 

completion factors a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim levels and processing cycles as well as other factors our judgments also consider the impacts of covid19 on these factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2020 



medical cost per member per month trend factors medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators which included consideration of covid19 in 2020 these factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as gdp growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of december 31 2020 



the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2020 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2020 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2020 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately 157 million 

for more detail related to our medical cost estimates see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements ” 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill for impairment we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value during a qualitative analysis we consider the impact of changes if any to the following factors macroeconomic industry and market factors cost factors changes in overall financial performance and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit if our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform additional quantitative analyses we may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment is recognized for the difference up to the carrying amount of goodwill 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a marketbased method the discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow including revenue trends medical costs trends operating productivity income taxes and capital levels longterm growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates financial projections and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategies discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unitspecific factors we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future additionally as part of our quantitative impairment testing we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions such as discount rates cash flow projections and peer company multiples to analyze the potential for a material impact the marketbased method requires determination of appropriate peer group whose securities are traded on an active market the peer group is used to derive market multiples to estimate fair value as of october 1 2020 we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements  ” 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base as of december 31 2020 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real and chilean peso 

as of december 31 2020 we had 20 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may significantly impact our investment income also as of december 31 2020 8 billion of our financial liabilities which include commercial paper debt and deposit liabilities were at interest rates which vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2020 37 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 45 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixedincome market sectors and debt across maturities as well as by matching a portion of our floatingrate assets and liabilities either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts unrealized gains and losses on investments in availableforsale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 point or 2 points as of december 31 2020 and 2019 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 



note given the low absolute level of shortterm market rates on our floatingrate assets and liabilities as of december 31 2020 the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero as of december 31 2020 and 2019 some of our investments had interest rates below 2 so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction 

we have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies primarily the brazilian real and the chilean peso to the us dollar in translation of unitedhealthcare global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and unitedhealthcare global’s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into us dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real or chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies for example as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical 10 and 25 increase in the value of the us dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately 535 million and 12 billion respectively we manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies 

as of december 31 2020 we had  23 billion of investments in equity securities primarily consisting of investments in employee savings plan related investments and nonus dollar fixedincome funds valuations in nonus dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates

the following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong our forwardlooking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify 

if we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our riskbased benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs our optumhealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial thirdparty payers which are also included in premium revenues under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a thirdparty payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs 

provided to the capitated member premium revenues from riskbased products comprise nearly 80 of our total consolidated revenues if we fail to predict accurately or effectively price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policies and medicaid contracts are typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted to cms in june the year before the contract year although we base the commercial and medicaid premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services largescale medical emergencies the introduction of new or costly drugs treatments and technology new treatment guidelines new mandated benefits such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2019 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1 higher than our actual medical costs without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2019 would have been reduced by approximately 320 million excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum mlrs 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove inaccurate our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business 

we are regulated by federal state and local governments in the united states and other countries where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements under state guaranty association laws certain insurance companies can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk that they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations 

certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies for example some of our unitedhealthcare and optum businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and non us selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts among others certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest these laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulations that are distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries including for example state telemedicine regulations debt collection laws banking regulations distributor and producer licensing requirements state corporate practice of medicine doctrines feesplitting rules and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change for example legislative administrative and public policy changes to the aca are being considered and we cannot predict if the aca will be further modified or repealed or replaced litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the aca in whole or in part and a federal appeals court struck down the aca as in part unconstitutional in 2019 that case has been remanded to federal district court further the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us including by subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our 

businesses could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to hhs for monitoring purposes geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business these regulatory regimes encompass among other matters local and crossborder taxation licensing tariffs intellectual property investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements management control labor antifraud anticorruption and privacy and data protection regulations including requirements for crossborder data transfers that vary by jurisdiction we currently operate outside of the united states and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states increasing our exposure to nonus regulatory regimes for example our unitedhealthcare global business subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans the agência nacional de saúde suplementar while the banmédica business is subject to chilean colombian and peruvian laws regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations that could differ from the approach taken by us regulators in addition our nonus businesses and operations are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the fcpa which prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs and chip and receive substantial revenues from these programs certain of our optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or termination of the contract at the option of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are possible in addition from time to time cms makes changes to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payments although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the medicare advantage program in addition payers in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from cms as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid 

managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and will not have additional members autoassigned to us in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors if any of these assumptions is materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of the aca cms has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including among others quality of care preventive services chronic illness management and customer satisfaction plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans our membership levels results of operations financial position and cash flows any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs including medicare and medicaid or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for medicare advantage plans as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits which have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms 

we have been and may in the future become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments such investigations audits reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that among other allegations we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false or erroneous claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which could result in adverse publicity the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate integrate upgrade or expand our existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is highly dependent on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members customers and health care professionals and to operate our business the volume of health care data generated and the uses of data including electronic health records are rapidly expanding our ability to implement new and innovative services price adequately our products and services provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems in addition connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could experience failures in our health wellness and information technology products lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers experience 

problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 

we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems’ capabilities enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to health data and the health information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including protected personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the united states due to our information technology systems and international business operations we are regularly the target of attempted cyberattacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use we have programs in place that are intended to detect contain and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns that could negatively affect our operations they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft coordinated attacks by activist entities misplaced or lost data human error malicious social engineering or other events that could negatively affect our systems our customers’ data proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties or our operations in certain circumstances we may rely on third party vendors to process store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be material our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability including regulatory penalties for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize protected personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of protected personal information is regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security laws 

regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations 

internationally many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the european union brazil chile india and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers for example effective may 2018 the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr overhauled data protection laws in the european union the new regulation superseded prior european union privacy and data protection legislation imposed more stringent european union data protection requirements on us or our customers and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance brazilian privacy legislation similar in certain respects to gdpr goes into effect in 2020 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data 

hipaa requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs administers its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our optum businesses including our optum labs business we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically deidentified in accordance with hipaa standards noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and among other consequences could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses 

we provide pharmacy care services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback beneficiary inducement and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially affect current industry practices including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies additionally various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain pbm practices which have resulted in other pbms agreeing to civil penalties including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements as a provider of pharmacy benefit management services optumrx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure registration and other laws and accreditation standards that impact the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager optumrx also conducts business through home delivery specialty and compounding pharmacies pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those of the dea and individual state controlled substance authorities the food and drug administration fda and boards of pharmacy 

we could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery specialty or compounding or clinicbased pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions from any of our home delivery specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa a private party or the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations if a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states south america and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate in particular markets our competitors compared to us may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements better existing business relationships lower profit margin or financial return expectations or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other health care professionals consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability 

in addition our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful and relevant to consumers we may not remain competitive and we risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants for example new directtoconsumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage and we may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants that could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other service providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain activities related to network design provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physician and hospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition acos practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and other organizational structures adopted by physicians hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

our health care benefits businesses have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members 

in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 

the success of some of our businesses including optumhealth and unitedhealthcare global depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees independent contractors or joint venture partners the physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us we face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians or to acquire recruit or in some instances employ physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of unitedhealthcare our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies or fail to adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely subject to various legal actions due to the nature of our business which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other matters the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort claims including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities or by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks whistleblower claims including claims under the false claims act or similar statutes contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers in addition we operate in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks while we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

we cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses 

any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the united states could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to medicare beneficiaries if we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and 

technology internally we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage if we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we expand and operate our business outside of the united states we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets languages business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses these challenges vary widely by country and outside of the united states may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to manage successfully our nonus acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and our future revenues costs and cash flows from international operations any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commission levels 

a number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies’ products if we were subjected to similar investigations and enforcement actions such actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services these conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2019  relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

as of december 31 2019  our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of 76 billion  representing 44 of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in equity could in turn adversely affect our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the financial covenants in our bank credit facilities 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases software and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary in most states we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to 

policyholders there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs

executive overview 

general 

unitedhealth group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone through our diversified businesses we leverage core competencies in data analytics and health information advanced technology and clinical expertise these core competencies are deployed within two distinct but strategically aligned business platforms health benefits operating under unitedhealthcare and health services operating under optum 

we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms unitedhealthcare and optum 

 further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in part i item 1 “business” and in note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the united states south america and certain other international health markets in the united states health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18 of gross domestic product gdp we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes which could impact our results of operations including our continued efforts to control health care costs 

pricing trends  to price our health care benefit products we start with our view of expected future costs we frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve considering relevant factors such as product positioning price competitiveness and environmental competitive legislative and regulatory considerations including minimum mlr thresholds we will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions 

the commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments we expect broadbased competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs the aca which includes three distinct taxes aca tax has an annual nondeductible insurance industry tax health insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for riskbased health insurance products a provision in the 2018 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2020 reflect the return of the health insurance industry tax the aca tax was permanently repealed by congress effective january 1 2021 

medicare advantage funding continues to be pressured as discussed below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties” 

we expect medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on medicaid margin percentages we continue to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships we continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the longterm viability of their programs 

medical cost trends our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs health system utilization and prescription drug costs we endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices with the objective of helping them achieve highquality affordable care 

delivery system and payment modernization the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality improve the health of populations and reduce costs we continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentivebased care provider payment models that reward highquality affordable care and foster collaboration we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients 

we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and costefficiency as of december 31 2019 we served over 17 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement including fullrisk sharedrisk and bundled episodeofcare and performance incentive payment approaches as of december 31 2019 our contracts with valuebased elements totaled 79 billion in annual spending including 20 billion through risktransfer agreements 

this trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician including new primary care channels and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems which we believe provide growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the aca and other regulatory matters for additional information regarding the aca and regulatory trends and uncertainties see part i item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 1a “risk factors” 

medicare advantage rates final 2020 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 25 short of the industry forward medical cost trend this combined with the return of the health insurance industry tax creates continued pressure in the medicare advantage program 

the ongoing medicare advantage funding pressure places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency there are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions in some years these adjustments impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks adjust members benefits and implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government additionally we decide annually on a countybycounty basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans 

our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings the level of star ratings from cms based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses 

aca tax a provision in the 2019 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax in 2020 the industrywide amount of the health insurance industry tax which is primarily borne by customers will be 155 billion and we expect our portion to be approximately 30 billion the aca tax was repealed by congress effective january 1 2021

results summary 

the following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information 

  

 2019 results of operations compared to 2018 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenue 

the increase in revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the number of individuals served through medicare advantage pricing trends and organic and acquisition growth across the optum business primarily due to expansion in pharmacy care services and care delivery partially offset by the moratorium of the health insurance industry tax in 2019 

medical costs and mcr 

medical costs increased due to growth in people served through medicare advantage and medical cost trends partially offset by increased prior year favorable medical development the mcr increased due to the revenue effects of the health insurance industry tax moratorium 

reportable segments 

see note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for more information on our segments the following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information 



unitedhealthcare 

the following table summarizes unitedhealthcare revenues by business 



the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our unitedhealthcare businesses by major market segment and funding arrangement 

feebased commercial group business increased primarily due to an acquisition medicare advantage increased due to the growth in people served through individual and employersponsored group medicare advantage plans the decrease in people served through medicaid was primarily driven by the proactive withdrawal from the iowa market as well as by states adding new carriers to existing programs and managing eligibility partially offset by increases in dual special needs plans the decrease in people served internationally is a result of our continued affordability efforts and underwriting discipline 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through commercial and medicare advantage including a greater mix of people with a higher acuity needs revenue increases were partially offset by the moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2019 earnings from operations were also favorably impacted by operating cost management 

optum 

total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below earnings from operations also increased due to productivity and overall cost management initiatives 

the results by segment were as follows 

optumhealth 

revenue increased at optumhealth primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in care delivery increased care services and organic growth in behavioral health services earnings from operations increased primarily due to care delivery optumhealth served approximately 96 million and 93 million people as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

optuminsight 

revenue and earnings from operations at optuminsight increased primarily due to organic and acquisition growth in managed services 

optumrx 

revenue at optumrx increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in specialty pharmacy partially offset by an expected large client transition earnings from operations increased primarily due to the factors that increased revenue as well as improved supply chain management optumrx fulfilled 1340 million and 1343 million adjusted scripts in 2019 and 2018 respectively with 2019 impacted by the large client transition 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the shortterm and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to among other things minimal levels of statutory capital as defined by their respective jurisdiction and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies 

our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 56 billion and 37 billion in 2019 and 2018 respectively see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of longterm debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



2019 cash flows compared to 2018 cash flows 

increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings as well as changes in working capital accounts other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included an increase in cash paid for acquisitions increased share repurchases and decreased net purchases of investments 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2019  our cash cash equivalent availableforsale debt securities and equity securities balances of 491 billion included 110 billion of cash and cash equivalents of which 584 million was available for general corporate use 361 billion of debt securities and 20 billion of investments in equity securities given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements 

our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 34 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “double a” as of december 31 2019  when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper and bank credit facilities our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent brokerdealers and are available for general corporate purposes for more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60 subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement as of december 31 2019 our debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was 39 

longterm debt periodically we access capital markets to issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes such as to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases for more information on our debt see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

credit ratings our credit ratings as of december 31 2019 were as follows 

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 

share repurchase program as of december 31 2019  we had board authorization to purchase up to 72 million shares of our common stock for more information on our share repurchase program see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

dividends in june 2019 the company’s board of directors increased the company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of 432 compared to 360 per share for more information on our dividend see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2019 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 



  

 we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations which include internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019 we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

recently issued accounting standards 

see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service approximately 90 of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months as of december 31 2019  our days outstanding in medical payables was 51 days calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period 

in each reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current 

period unfavorable development medical costs in 2019 2018 and 2017 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 580 million  320 million and 690 million  respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example for the most recent two months we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors 

completion factors a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim levels and processing cycles as well as other factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2019    

medical cost per member per month trend factors medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as gdp growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes and epidemics 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of december 31 2019  



the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2019  however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2019 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs 

payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2019 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately 160 million 

for more detail related to our medical cost estimates see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill for impairment we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value during a qualitative analysis we consider the impact of changes if any to the following factors macroeconomic industry and market factors cost factors changes in overall financial performance and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform additional quantitative analyses we may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed we perform a multistep test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates for each reporting unit comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

forecasts and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategies key assumptions used in these forecasts include 

 discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unitspecific factors we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future as of october 1 2019 we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base as of december 31 2019  there were no significant concentrations of credit risk

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real and chilean peso 

as of december 31 2019  we had 14 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may significantly impact our investment income also as of december 31 2019  9 billion of our financial liabilities which include commercial paper debt and deposit liabilities were at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2019  33 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 39 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixedincome market sectors and debt across maturities as well as by endeavoring to match our floatingrate assets and liabilities over time either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts unrealized gains and losses on investments in availableforsale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 point or 2 points as of december 31 2019 and 2018 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 

  

 we have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies primarily the brazilian real and the chilean peso to the us dollar in translation of unitedhealthcare global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and unitedhealthcare global’s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into us dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real or chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies for example as of december 31 2019  a hypothetical 10 and 25 increase in the value of the us dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately 600 million and 13 billion respectively we manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies 

as of december 31 2019  we had 20 billion of investments in equity securities primarily consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments and dividend paying stocks valuations in nonus dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates

risk factors 

tableend cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words “believe” “expect” 

“intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “forecast” “outlook” “plan” “project” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements any forwardlooking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances including unanticipated events after the date of this report 

the following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong our forwardlooking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify 

if we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our riskbased benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased benefits products comprise nearly 80 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs in addition our optumhealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial thirdparty payers under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a thirdparty payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member if we fail to predict accurately or effectively price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policies and medicaid contracts are typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted to cms in june the year before the contract year although we base the commercial and medicaid premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services largescale medical emergencies the introduction of new or costly drugs treatments and technology new treatment guidelines new mandated benefits such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2018 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1 higher than our actual medical costs without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2018 would have been reduced by approximately 305 million excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum mlrs 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove inaccurate our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business 

we are regulated by federal state and local governments in the united states and other countries where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements under state guaranty association laws certain insurance companies can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business any such assessment could 

expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk that they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations 

certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies for example some of our unitedhealthcare and optum businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and non us selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts among others certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest these laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulations that are distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries including for example state telemedicine regulations debt collection laws banking regulations distributor and producer licensing requirements state corporate practice of medicine doctrines feesplitting rules and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change for example legislative administrative and public policy changes to the aca are being considered and we cannot predict if the aca will be further modified or repealed or replaced litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the aca in whole or in part and a federal district court struck down the aca in its entirety as unconstitutional in 2018 that opinion has been stayed and appealed further the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us including by subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to hhs for monitoring purposes geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business these regulatory regimes encompass among other matters local and crossborder taxation licensing tariffs intellectual property investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements management control labor antifraud anticorruption and privacy and data protection regulations including requirements for crossborder data transfers that vary by jurisdiction we currently operate outside of the united states and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states increasing our exposure to nonus regulatory regimes for example our unitedhealthcare global business subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans the agência nacional de saúde suplementar while the banmédica business is subject to chilean colombian and peruvian laws regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations that could differ from the approach taken by us regulators in addition our nonus businesses and operations are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the fcpa which prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs and chip and receive substantial revenues from these programs certain of our optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or termination of the contract at the option of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are possible in addition from time to time cms makes changes to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payments although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the medicare advantage program in addition payers in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from cms as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and will not have additional members autoassigned to us in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors if any of these assumptions is materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of the aca cms has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including among others quality of care preventive services chronic illness management and customer satisfaction plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans our membership levels results of operations financial position and cash flows any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs including medicare and medicaid or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for medicare advantage plans as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits which have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms 

we have been and may in the future become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments for example various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain pbm practices which have resulted in other pbms agreeing to civil penalties including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements additionally such investigations audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that among other allegations we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false or erroneous claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which could result in adverse publicity the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including protected personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the united states due to our information technology systems and international business operations we are regularly the target of attempted cyberattacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use we have programs in place that are intended to detect contain and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns that could negatively affect our operations they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft coordinated attacks by activist entities misplaced or lost data human error malicious social engineering or other events that could negatively affect our systems our customers’ data proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties or our operations in certain circumstances we may rely on third party vendors to process store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be material our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability including regulatory penalties for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize protected personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of protected personal information is regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations for example the hitech amendments to hipaa imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect disclose and use protected personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business 

internationally many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the european union brazil chile india and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers for example effective may 2018 the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr overhauled data protection laws in the european union the new regulation superseded 

prior european union privacy and data protection legislation imposed more stringent european union data protection requirements on us or our customers and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance brazilian privacy legislation similar in certain respects to gdpr goes into effect in 2020 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data 

hipaa requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our optum businesses including our optum labs business we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically deidentified in accordance with hipaa standards noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and among other consequences could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses 

we provide pharmacy care services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback beneficiary inducement and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers as a provider of pharmacy benefit management services optumrx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure registration and other laws and accreditation standards that impact the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager optumrx also conducts business through home delivery specialty and compounding pharmacies pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those of the dea and individual state controlled substance authorities the fda and boards of pharmacy in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially affect current industry practices including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies 

we could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery specialty or compounding or clinicbased pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions from any of our home delivery specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa a private party or the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations if a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows   could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states south america and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate in particular markets our competitors compared to us may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements better existing business relationships lower profit margin or financial return expectations or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger 

and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other health care professionals consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability 

in addition our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful and relevant to consumers we may not remain competitive and we risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants for example new directtoconsumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage and we may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants that could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other service providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain activities related to network design provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physician and hospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition acos practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and other organizational structures adopted by physicians hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

our health care benefits businesses have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 

the success of some of our businesses including optumhealth and unitedhealthcare global depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees independent contractors or joint venture partners the physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or 

otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us there is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians or to acquire recruit or in some instances employ physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of unitedhealthcare our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies or fail to adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows   

we are routinely subject to various legal actions due to the nature of our business which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other matters the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort claims including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities or by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks whistleblower claims including claims under the false claims act or similar statutes contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers in addition we operate in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks while we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

we cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses 

any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the united states could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to medicare beneficiaries if we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage if we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we expand and operate our business outside of the united states we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets languages business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses these challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to manage successfully our nonus acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and our future revenues costs and cash flows from international operations any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commission levels 

a number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies’ products if we were subjected to similar investigations and enforcement actions such actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services these conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2018  relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

as of december 31 2018  our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of 68 billion  representing 45  of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in equity could in turn adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the financial covenants in our bank credit facilities 

if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate integrate upgrade or expand our existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to price adequately our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems’ capabilities enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases software and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary 

information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary in most states we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs

tableend the following discussion should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements thereto included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  readers are cautioned that the statements estimates projections or outlook contained in this report including discussions regarding 

financial prospects economic conditions trends and uncertainties contained in this item 7 may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements a description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this item 7 and in part i item 1a “risk factors” 

executive overview 

general 

unitedhealth group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone through our diversified family of businesses we leverage core competencies in data analytics and health information advanced technology and clinical expertise these core competencies are deployed within our two distinct but strategically aligned business platforms health benefits operating under unitedhealthcare and health services operating under optum 

we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms unitedhealthcare and optum 

 further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in part i item 1 “business”  and in  note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the united states south america and certain other international health markets in the united states health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18 of gross domestic product gdp we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations 

pricing trends  to price our health care benefit products we start with our view of expected future costs we frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve considering relevant factors such as product positioning price competitiveness and environmental competitive legislative and regulatory considerations including minimum mlr thresholds we will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions 

the commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments we expect broadbased competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes the aca included an annual nondeductible insurance industry tax health insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for riskbased health insurance products a provision in the 2018 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax pricing for contracts that cover a portion of calendar year 2019 reflected the impact of the moratorium the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization which has impacted the competitive pricing environment 

medicare advantage funding continues to be pressured as discussed below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties”   

we expect continued medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on medicaid margin percentages we continue to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships we continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the longterm viability of their programs 

medical cost trends our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs health system utilization and prescription drug costs we endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices with the objective of helping them achieve highquality affordable care 

delivery system and payment modernization  the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality improve the health of populations and reduce costs we continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentivebased care provider payment models that reward highquality affordable care and foster collaboration we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients 

we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and costefficiency as of december 31 2018 we served nearly 17 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement including fullrisk sharedrisk and bundled episodeofcare and performance incentive payment approaches as of december 31 2018 our contracts with valuebased elements totaled 74 billion in annual spending including 18 billion through risktransfer agreements 

this trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician including new primary care channels and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems which we believe provide growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the aca and other regulatory matters for additional information regarding the aca and regulatory trends and uncertainties see part i item 1 “business  government regulation”  and item 1a “risk factors” 

medicare advantage rates  final 2019 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of 34 short of the industry forward medical cost trend which creates continued pressure in the medicare advantage program 

the ongoing pressure on medicare advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency there are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions in some years these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks adjust members benefits and implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government additionally we decide annually on a countybycounty basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans 

as medicare advantage payments change other products may become relatively more attractive to medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our marketleading medicare supplement and standalone medicare part d insurance offerings 

our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings the level of star ratings from cms based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses 

tax reform tax reform was enacted by the us federal government in december 2017 changing existing united states tax law including reducing the us corporate income tax rate in 2018 the impact of tax reform was partially offset by the return of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax 

health insurance industry tax  after a moratorium in 2017 the industrywide amount of the health insurance industry tax in 2018 was 143 billion with our portion being 26 billion the return of the tax impacted yearoveryear comparability of our financial results including revenues the medical care ratio mcr operating cost ratio and effective tax rate a one year moratorium is imposed on the collection of the health insurance industry tax in 2019 

selected operating performance items 

the following represents a summary of select 2018  yearoveryear operating comparisons to 2017  



results summary 

the following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information 

  

  

 2018 results of operations compared to 2017 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenue 

the increase in revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the number of individuals served through riskbased products across our unitedhealthcare benefits businesses pricing trends including the health insurance industry tax in 2018 and growth across the optum business primarily due to expansion and growth in care delivery pharmacy care services managed services and advisory services 

medical costs and mcr 

medical costs increased due to growth in people served through riskbased products and medical cost trends the mcr decreased due to the revenue effects of the health insurance industry tax which more than offset business mix changes and a lower level of favorable reserve development 

reportable segments 

see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  for more information on our segments the following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information 



unitedhealthcare 

the following table summarizes unitedhealthcare revenues by business 



the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our unitedhealthcare businesses by major market segment and funding arrangement 

the overall increase in people served through riskbased benefit plans in the commercial group market was due to growth in services to small groups feebased commercial group business declined primarily due to customers converting their retirees to medicare advantage plans as well as certain customers expanding the number of carriers and reconfiguring geographies served medicare advantage increased yearoveryear due to growth in people served through individual and employersponsored group medicare advantage plans the decrease in people served through medicaid was primarily driven by states adding new carriers to existing programs reduced enrollment from state efforts to manage eligibility status and the sale of our new mexico medicaid plan medicare supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales international growth was primarily driven by an acquisition in the first quarter 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served across its riskbased businesses a higher revenue membership mix rate increases for underlying medical cost trends and the impact of the return of the health insurance industry tax unitedhealthcare’s operating margin decreased slightly due to the performance of our traditional communitybased tanf medicaid business 

optum 

total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below as well as productivity and overall cost management initiatives 

the results by segment were as follows

2017 results of operations compared to 2016 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenue 

the increase in revenue was primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our unitedhealthcare benefits businesses and growth across the optum business the increase was partially offset by revenue decreases due to the withdrawals of the acacompliant products in the individual market and the effects of the health insurance industry tax moratorium 

medical costs and mcr

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the shortterm and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of 

statutory capital as defined by each jurisdiction and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 

in both 2018 and 2017 our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 37 billion see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of longterm debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends andor repurchases of our common stock depending on market conditions 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



2018 cash flows compared to 2017 cash flows 

increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings in 2018 and the impact to 2017 cash flows from operating activities due to a change in net deferred tax liabilities from tax reform partially offset by changes in working capital accounts 

other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included net issuances of debt in 2018 compared to net repayments in 2017 an increase in cash paid for acquisitions increased share repurchases and a decrease in customer funds administered due to the timing of government payments 

2017 cash flows compared to 2016 cash flows 

increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings and changes in working capital accounts partially offset by the change in net deferred tax liabilities driven by tax reform 

other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included net repayments of debt compared to 2016 net proceeds from debt issuances which were partially offset by lower net purchases of investments 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2018  our cash cash equivalent availableforsale debt securities and equity securities balances of 447 billion included 109 billion  of cash and cash equivalents of which 925 million was available for general corporate use 319 billion  of debt securities and 20 billion of investments in equity securities given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  for further detail concerning our fair value measurements 

our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 33 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “double a” as of december 31 2018  when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper and bank credit facilities  our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through thirdparty brokerdealers and are available for general corporate purposes for more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60 as of december 31 2018 our debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was 38 

longterm debt  periodically we access capital markets to issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes such as to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases for more information on our debt see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

credit ratings  our credit ratings as of december 31 2018  were as follows 

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 

share repurchase program  as of december 31 2018  we had board authorization to purchase up to 94 million  shares of our common stock for more information on our share repurchase program see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

dividends in june 2018 our board increased our annual cash dividend rate to shareholders to 360  per share from 300 per share for more information on our dividend see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2018 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 



  

 pending acquisitions in december 2017 we entered into an agreement to acquire a company in the health care sector for a total of approximately 43 billion which is not reflected in the table above 

we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations which include internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018 we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

recently issued accounting standards 

see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service approximately 90  of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months as of december 31 2018  our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period 

in each reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2018 2017 and 2016 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 320 million  690 million  and 220 million  respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example for the most recent two months we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors 

completion factors  a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2018    

medical cost per member per month trend factors  medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as gdp growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes and epidemics 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of december 31 2018  



the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2018  however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2018  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2018 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately 140 million 

for more detail related to our medical cost estimates see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenues 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services 

our medicare advantage and medicare part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the cms risk adjustment payment methodology the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations the actual amount of cms’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and accordingly our profitability for more detail on premium revenues see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  risk adjustment data for our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments including audit by regulators see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  for additional information regarding these audits our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum mlr rebates payable by us 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill for impairment we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value during a qualitative analysis we consider the impact of changes if any to the following factors macroeconomic industry and market factors cost factors changes in overall financial performance and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform additional quantitative analyses we may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed we perform a multistep test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates for each reporting unit comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

forecasts and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategies key assumptions used in these forecasts include 



 discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unitspecific factors we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future as of october 1 2018 we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values 

intangible assets  our finitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including changes in the use of the assets changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value experienced or expected operating cashflow deterioration or losses adverse changes in customer populations adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist to determine if an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value intangible assets were not impaired in 2018 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base as of december 31 2018  there were no significant concentrations of credit risk

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real and chilean peso 

as of december 31 2018 we had 14 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also as of december 31 2018 9 billion of our financial liabilities which include commercial paper debt and deposit liabilities were at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2018 30 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 32 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixedincome market sectors and debt across maturities as well as by endeavoring to match our floatingrate assets and liabilities over time either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts unrealized gains and losses on investments in availableforsale securities are reported in comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 point or 2 points as of december 31 2018  and 2017 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 

  

 we have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies primarily the brazilian real and the chilean peso to the us dollar in translation of unitedhealthcare global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and unitedhealthcare global’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into us dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real or chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies for example as of december 31 2018 a hypothetical 10 and 25 increase in the value of the us dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately 600 million and 14 billion respectively we manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies 

as of december 31 2018 we had 20 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments and dividend paying stocks valuations in nonus dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates

cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “forecast” “outlook” “plan” “project” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements any forwardlooking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances including unanticipated events after the date of this report 

the following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong our forwardlooking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify 

if we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our riskbased benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased benefits products comprise nearly 80 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs in this regard federal and state regulatory requirements obligate our commercial medicare advantage and certain statebased medicaid health plans to maintain minimum mlrs which could make it more difficult for us to obtain price increases for our products in addition our optumhealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial thirdparty payers under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a thirdparty payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the 

capitated member if we fail to predict accurately price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policies and medicaid contracts are typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted to cms in june the year before the contract year although we base the commercial and medicaid premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services natural catastrophes or other largescale medical emergencies epidemics the introduction of new or costly drugs treatments and technology new treatment guidelines new mandated benefits such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2017 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1 higher without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2017 would have been reduced by approximately 235 million excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum mlrs 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove inaccurate our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business 

we are regulated by federal state and local governments in the united states and other countries where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements some of our unitedhealthcare and optum businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and nonus selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds in addition under state guaranty association laws certain insurance companies can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business some states have similar laws relating to hmos and other payers such as consumer operated and oriented plans coops established under the aca any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations 

certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts among others certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest these laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulations that are distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries including for example state telemedicine regulations debt collection laws banking regulations distributor and producer licensing requirements state corporate practice of medicine doctrines feesplitting rules and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change for example legislative administrative and public policy changes to the aca are being debated and we cannot predict if the aca will be further modified or repealed or replaced additionally the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our 

health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to hhs for monitoring purposes geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business these regulatory regimes encompass among other matters local and crossborder taxation licensing tariffs intellectual property investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements management control labor antifraud anticorruption and privacy and data protection regulations including requirements for crossborder data transfers that vary by jurisdiction we currently operate outside of the united states and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states increasing our exposure to nonus regulatory regimes for example our unitedhealthcare brazil business subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans the agência nacional de saúde suplementar whose approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by us regulators in addition our nonus businesses and operations are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the fcpa which prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs and chip and receive substantial revenues from these programs certain of our optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or as is a typical feature of many government contracts termination of the contract at the option of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are possible in addition from time to time cms makes changes to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payments although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the medicare advantage program in addition payers in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from cms as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a 

regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and will not have additional members autoassigned to us in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors if any of these assumptions is materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of the aca cms has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including among others quality of care preventive services chronic illness management and customer satisfaction plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans our membership levels results of operations financial position and cash flows any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs including medicare and medicaid or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for medicare advantage plans as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits which have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms 

we have been and may in the future become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments for example various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain pbm practices which have resulted in other pbms agreeing to civil penalties including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements additionally such investigations audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that among other allegations we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false or erroneous claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which could result in adverse publicity the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including protected personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or thirdparties some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the united states due to our information technology systems and international business operations we are regularly the target of attempted cyberattacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber risks to protect to the greatest extent possible against cyber risks and security breaches however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third 

parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft coordinated attacks by activist entities misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customer’s data 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be material our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize protected personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations for example the hitech amendments to hipaa imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect disclose and use protected personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business 

internationally many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the european union and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers for example in may 2018 the european union’s general data protection regulation will overhaul data protection laws in the european union the new regulation will supersede current european union data protection legislation may impose more stringent european union data protection requirements on us or our customers and may prescribe greater penalties for noncompliance 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities 

hipaa requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our optum businesses including our optum labs business we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically deidentified in accordance with hipaa standards noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business including mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards among other consequences any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses 

we provide pharmacy care services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback beneficiary inducement and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers as a provider of pharmacy benefit management services optumrx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure registration and other laws and accreditation standards that impact the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager optumrx also conducts business through home delivery specialty pharmacies and home infusion which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including 

those of the dea and individual state controlled substance authorities the fda and boards of pharmacy in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies 

we could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions from any of our home delivery specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa a private party or the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations if a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pharmacy care services businesses in connection with services for which our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows   could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states south america and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate in particular markets our competitors compared to us may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements better existing business relationships lower profit margin or financial return expectations or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other health care professionals consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability in addition new directtoconsumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage and we may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other service providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain activities related to network design provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our 

operations in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 

the success of some of our businesses including optumhealth and unitedhealthcare brazil depend on maintaining satisfactory physician relationships as employees independent contractors or joint venture partners the physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us there is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians or to acquire recruit or in some instances employ physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and hmo competitors of unitedhealthcare our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or hmo companies or fail to adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows   

we are routinely subject to various litigation actions due to the nature of our business which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other matters the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort claims including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities or by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks whistleblower claims including claims under the false claims act or similar statutes contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers in addition we operate in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks while we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

we cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions 

could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses 

any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the united states could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to medicare beneficiaries if we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage if we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we expand and operate our business outside of the united states we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets languages business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses these challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to manage successfully our nonus acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and our future revenues costs and cash flows from international operations any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete intensely our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commission levels 

a number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies’ products if we were subjected to similar investigations and enforcement actions such actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services these conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hmos hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2017  relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

as of december 31 2017  goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of 63 billion  representing 45  of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in equity could in turn adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities 

if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate integrate upgrade or expand our existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to price adequately our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse 

consequences our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases software and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary in most states we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs

executive overview 

general 

unitedhealth group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the 

health system work better for everyone through our diversified family of businesses we leverage core competencies in advanced enabling technology health care data information and intelligence and clinical care delivery management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system these core competencies are deployed within our two distinct but strategically aligned business platforms health benefits operating under unitedhealthcare and health services operating under optum 

we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms unitedhealthcare and optum 

 further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in part i item 1 “business”  and in  note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the united states south america and certain other international health markets in the united states health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18 of gross domestic product we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations 

pricing trends  to price our health care benefit products we start with our view of expected future costs we frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve considering all relevant factors such as product positioning price competitiveness and environmental competitive legislative and regulatory considerations including minimum mlr thresholds we will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions 

the commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments we expect broadbased competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes the aca included an annual nondeductible insurance industry tax health insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for riskbased health insurance products a provision in the 2016 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax pricing for contracts that cover a portion of calendar year 2018 reflected the impact of the returning health insurance industry tax conversely the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization which has impacted the competitive pricing environment 

medicare advantage funding continues to be pressured as discussed below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties”   

we expect continued medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on medicaid margin percentages we continue to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships we advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the longterm viability of their programs 

medical cost trends our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs health system utilization and prescription drug costs we endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices with the objective of helping them achieve high quality affordable care 

delivery system and payment modernization  the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality improve the health of populations and reduce costs we continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentivebased care provider payment models that reward highquality affordable care and foster collaboration we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients 

we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and costefficiency as of december 31 2017 we served nearly 16 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement including fullrisk shared 

risk and bundled episodeofcare and performance incentive payment approaches as of december 31 2017 our contracts with valuebased elements total nearly 65 billion in annual spending 

this trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician including new primary care channels and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems which we believe provide growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the aca and other regulatory matters for additional information regarding the aca and regulatory trends and uncertainties see part i item 1 “business  government regulation”  and item 1a “risk factors” 

medicare advantage rates  final 2018 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 045 well short of the industry forward medical cost trend of 3 as well as the return of the health insurance industry tax in 2018 described below which creates continued pressure in the medicare advantage program the impact of this funding shortfall in medicare advantage is partially mitigated by reductions in provider payments for those care providers with rates indexed to medicare advantage revenues or medicare feeforservice payment rates these factors can affect our plan benefit designs pricing growth prospects and earnings expectations for our medicare advantage plans 

the ongoing pressure on medicare advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency there are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions in some years these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks and adjust members benefits implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government additionally we decide annually on a countybycounty basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans 

as medicare advantage payments change other products may become relatively more attractive to medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our marketleading medicare supplement and standalone medicare part d insurance offerings 

our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings the level of star ratings from cms based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses in addition star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits which ultimately may affect the plan’s membership and revenue for the 2017 payment year approximately 80 of our medicare advantage members were in plans rated four stars or higher we expect that at least 85 of our medicare advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2018 we continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance 

tax reform tax reform was enacted by the us federal government in december 2017 changing existing united states tax law including reducing the us corporate income tax rate the company remeasured deferred taxes as of the date of enactment which resulted in a 12 billion reduction to the net deferred tax liability and corresponding increase to earnings in 2017 with tax reform we expect that our effective tax rate in 2018 will be approximately 24 

health insurance industry tax  a provision in the 2016 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax in 2018 the industrywide amount of the health insurance industry tax will be 143 billion and we expect our portion to be approximately 28 billion a one year moratorium on the collection of the health insurance industry tax will occur in 2019

consolidated financial results 

revenue

medical costs and mcr 

medical costs increased due to riskbased membership growth and medical cost trends the mcr increased due to the effects of the health insurance industry tax moratorium offset primarily by the reduction in individual aca business medical management initiatives and an increase in favorable medical cost reserve development

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the shortterm and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each jurisdiction and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 

in 2017 our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 37 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 39 billion see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of longterm debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends andor repurchases of our common stock depending on market conditions 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



2017 cash flows compared to 2016 cash flows 

increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings and changes in working capital accounts partially offset by the change in net deferred tax liabilities driven by tax reform 

other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included net repayments of debt compared to 2016 net proceeds from debt issuances which were partially offset by lower net purchases of investments 

2016 cash flows compared to 2015 cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities increased slightly as higher net earnings were mostly offset by increased cms receivables and other operating items 

other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included increased net purchases of investments in 2016 and the decreases in cash paid for acquisitions and proceeds from debt issuances due to the 2015 acquisition of catamaran 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2017  our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 424 billion  included 120 billion  of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 800 million  was available for general corporate use 284 billion  of debt securities and 20 billion  of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments and dividend paying stocks given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  for further detail concerning our fair value measurements 

our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 32 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “double a” as of december 31 2017  when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper and bank credit facilities  our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through thirdparty brokerdealers and are available for general corporate purposes for more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 55 as of december 31 2017 our debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was approximately 37 

longterm debt  periodically we access capital markets to issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes such as to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases for more information on our debt see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

credit ratings  our credit ratings as of december 31 2017  were as follows 

  

 the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic 

and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 

share repurchase program  as of december 31 2017  we had board authorization to purchase up to 42 million  shares of our common stock for more information on our share repurchase program see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

dividends in june 2017 our board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders by 20 to an annual dividend rate of 300  per share for more information on our dividend see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2017 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 



 pending acquisitions in december 2017 we entered into agreements to acquire two companies in the health care sector for a total of approximately 77 billion which are not reflected in the table above one of the acquisitions closed in january 2018 the other is expected to close later in 2018 subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions 

we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations which include internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017 we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

recently issued accounting standards 

see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent 

periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service approximately 90  of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months as of december 31 2017  our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period 

in each reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2017 2016 and 2015 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 690 million  220 million  and 320 million  respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example for the most recent two months we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors 

completion factors  a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2017    

medical cost per member per month trend factors  medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as grossdomestic product growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes and epidemics 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of december 31 2017  



the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2017  however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2017  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2017 net earnings would have increased or decreased by 110 million 

for more detail related to our medical cost estimates see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

revenues 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services 

our medicare advantage and medicare part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the cms risk adjustment payment methodology the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations the actual amount of cms’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and accordingly our profitability for more detail on premium revenues see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  risk adjustment data for our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments including audit by regulators see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  for additional information regarding these audits our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum mlr rebates payable by us 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill for impairment we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value during a qualitative analysis we consider the impact of changes if any to the following factors macroeconomic industry and market factors cost factors changes in overall financial performance and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform additional quantitative analyses we may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed we perform a multistep test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates 

for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates for each reporting unit comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

forecasts and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategies key assumptions used in these forecasts include 

 discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unitspecific factors we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of october 1 2017 all of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values 

intangible assets  our finitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including changes in the use of the assets changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value experienced or expected operating cashflow deterioration or losses adverse changes in customer populations adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist to determine if an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value intangible assets were not impaired in 2017 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base as of december 31 2017  there were no significant concentrations of credit risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real 

as of december 31 2017 we had 15 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also as of december 31 2017 85 billion of our financial liabilities which include commercial paper debt and deposit liabilities were at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2017 259 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 287 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixedincome market sectors and debt across maturities as well as by endeavoring to match our floatingrate assets and liabilities over time either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts unrealized gains and losses on investments in availableforsale securities are reported in comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 point or 2 points as of december 31 2017  and 2016 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 

  

nm  not meaningful 

 we have an exposure to changes in the value of the brazilian real to the us dollar in translation of unitedhealthcare brazil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and unitedhealthcare brazil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into us dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in brazilian real for example as of december 31 2017 a hypothetical 10 and 25 increase in the value of the us dollar against the brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately 500 million and 11 billion respectively we manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies 

as of december 31 2017 we had 20 billion  of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments and dividend paying stocks valuations in nonus dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates

cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “forecast” “outlook” “plan” “project” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances including unanticipated events after the date of this report 

the following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong our forwardlooking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify 

if we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our riskbased benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased benefits products comprise nearly 80 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs in this regard federal and state regulatory requirements obligate our commercial medicare advantage and certain statebased medicaid health plans to maintain minimum mlrs which could make it more difficult for us to obtain price increases for our products in addition our optumhealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial thirdparty payers under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a thirdparty payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member if we fail to predict accurately price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year although we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services natural catastrophes or other largescale medical emergencies epidemics the introduction of new or costly drugs treatments and technology new mandated benefits such as the expansion of 

essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2016 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1 higher without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2016 would have been reduced by approximately 240 million excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment reinsurance or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum mlrs 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove inaccurate our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business 

we are regulated by federal state and local governments in the united states and other countries where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements some of our unitedhealthcare and optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and nonus selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds in addition under state guaranty association laws certain insurance companies can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business some states have similar laws relating to hmos and other payers such as consumer operated and oriented plans coops established under the aca any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations 

certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts among others certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest these laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulations which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries including for example state telemedicine regulations debt collection laws banking regulations distributor and producer licensing requirements state corporate practice of medicine doctrines feesplitting rules health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increases to hhs for monitoring purposes on many of our products geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business these regulatory regimes encompass among other matters local and crossborder taxation licensing tariffs intellectual property investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements management control labor antifraud anticorruption and privacy and data protection regulations including requirements for crossborder data 

transfers that vary by jurisdiction we currently operate outside of the united states and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states increasing our exposure to nonus regulatory regimes for example our unitedhealthcare brazil business subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans the agência nacional de saúde suplementar whose approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by us regulators in addition our nonus businesses and operations are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the fcpa which prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

the aca could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

due to its complexity and continued uncertainty the aca’s impact remains difficult to predict and could adversely affect us the aca includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace including guaranteed availability of coverage adjusted community rating requirements which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors essential health benefit requirements resulting in benefit changes for many members and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing or a combination of both for many policyholders in addition if we do not maintain certain mlrs we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers these requirements can cause significant disruptions in local health care markets and adjustments to our business all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if the number of individuals who gain coverage under the aca varies from our expectations if the demand for the aca related products and capabilities offered by our optum businesses is less than anticipated or if our costs are greater than anticipated   

the trump administration and congressional leaders have expressed their intentions to repeal and replace the aca we cannot predict if the aca will be modified repealed or replaced but changes to this law could materially impact our operating results require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs chip and our tricare contract with the dod and receive substantial revenues from these programs certain of our optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or as is a typical feature of many government contracts termination of the contract at the option of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are possible in addition from time to time cms makes changes to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payments although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully 

address the funding pressures in the medicare advantage program in addition payers in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from cms as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and will not have additional members autoassigned to us in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions is materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of the aca cms has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to medicare advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including among other things quality of care preventative services chronic illness management and customer satisfaction plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect our membership levels results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition under the aca congress authorized cms and the states to implement mmp managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs including medicare medicaid and the mmp demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjusting monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for medicare advantage plans as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms 

we have been and may in the future become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review including for compliance with coding and other requirements under the medicare riskadjustment model our chart review programs and related processes such investigations audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that among other allegations we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which could result in adverse publicity the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business 

model or operations for example the hitech amendments to hipaa imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect disclose and use sensitive personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business in addition the general data protection regulation of the european union imposes higher potential penalties and more stringent compliance and data security requirements on our ability to collect process and transfer personal data relating to our european businesses 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities 

hipaa requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our optum businesses including our optum labs business we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically deidentified in accordance with hipaa standards noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business including mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards among other consequences any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses 

we provide pharmacy care services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers optumrx also conducts business through home delivery and specialty pharmacies which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those of the dea and individual state controlled substance authorities in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including potential new regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies 

our pharmacy care services businesses would be materially and adversely affected by our inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions at any of our home delivery or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa a private party or the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pharmacy care services businesses in connection with services for which our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows   could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states brazil and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate in particular markets our competitors compared to us may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements better existing business relationships lower profit margin or financial return expectations or other factors that 

give such competitors a competitive advantage in addition our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability additionally new directtoconsumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits health care usage and in the effective navigation of the health care system we may be challenged by new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other service providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain activities related to network design provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly distract managements’ attention and result in negative publicity 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 

the success of certain businesses including optumhealth and unitedhealthcare brazil depend on maintaining satisfactory physician employment relationships the physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us there is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians or to acquire recruit or in some instances employ physicians or to retain enrollees 

following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and hmo competitors of unitedhealthcare our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or hmo companies or adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows   

we are routinely subject to various litigation actions due to the nature of our business which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other matters the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort claims including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks whistleblower claims including claims under the false claims act or similar statutes contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers in addition we operate in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

we cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses 

any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to medicare beneficiaries if we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows success in completing acquisitions is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage if we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we expand and operate our business outside of the united states we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses these challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability government intervention 

discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to manage successfully our nonus acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and our future revenues costs and cash flows from international operations any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products and services are sold in part through independent producers and consultants with whom we do not have exclusive contracts and for whose services and allegiance we must compete intensely our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commissions 

a number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies’ products if we were subjected to similar investigations and enforcement actions they could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services these conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hmos hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2016  relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and equity 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our equity in addition if it 

became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

as of december 31 2016  goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of 56 billion  representing 46  of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in equity could in turn adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities 

if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate integrate upgrade or expand our existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to price adequately our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or thirdparties some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the united states due to our information technology systems and international business operations we may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or 

theft coordinated attacks by activist entities misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customer’s data 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases software and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary in most states we are required to seek prior approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt and capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs

competencies in advanced enabling technology health care data information and intelligence and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system these core competencies are deployed within our two distinct but strategically aligned business platforms health benefits operating under unitedhealthcare and health services operating under optum 

we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms unitedhealthcare and optum 

 further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in part i item 1 “business”  and in  note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

recent developments 

we have recognized in our financial results for the fourth quarter 2016 and the year ended december 31 2016 the previously disclosed 350 million  impact of our estimated share of guaranty association assessments resulting from the liquidation of penn treaty network america insurance company and its subsidiary penn treaty following accounting legal and regulatory consultations in connection with our 10k filing this charge will be funded over several years and affected by premium tax credits over time 

for more detail related to the penn treaty liquidation see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the united states brazilian and certain other international health markets in the united states health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18 of gross domestic product we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations 

pricing trends  to price our health care benefit products we start with our view of expected future costs we frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve considering all relevant factors such as product positioning price competitiveness and environmental competitive legislative and regulatory considerations our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum mlr thresholds and the risk adjustment that impacts the small group and individual markets we will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions 

the commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments we expect broadbased competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes the aca included an annual nondeductible insurance industry tax health insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for riskbased health insurance products a provision in the 2016 federal budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2017 will reflect the impact of the moratorium additionally the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization which has impacted the competitive pricing environment 

medicare advantage funding continues to be pressured as discussed below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties”   

we expect continued medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on medicaid net margin percentages we continue to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships we advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the longterm viability of their programs 

medical cost trends our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs health system utilization and prescription drug costs we endeavor to mitigate those increases with medical management our 2017 management activities include managing costs across all health care categories including specialty pharmacy spending as new therapies are introduced at high costs and older drugs experience price increases 

delivery system and payment modernization  the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality improve the health of populations and reduce costs we continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentivebased care provider payment models that reward highquality affordable care and foster collaboration we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients 

we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and costefficiency as of december 31 2016 we served more than 15 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement including fullrisk sharedrisk and bundled episodeofcare and performance incentive payment approaches as of december 31 2016 our contracts with valuebased elements total nearly 53 billion in annual spending 

this trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician including new primary care channels and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems which we believe provide growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the aca and other regulatory matters for additional information regarding the aca and regulatory trends and uncertainties see part i item 1 “business  government regulation”  and item 1a “risk factors” 

medicare advantage rates  final 2017 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 085 well short of the industry forward medical cost trend of 3 which creates continued pressure in the medicare advantage program the impact of this funding shortfall in medicare advantage is partially mitigated by reductions in provider payments for those care providers with rates indexed to medicare advantage revenues or medicare feeforservice payment rates these factors can affect our plan benefit designs pricing growth prospects and earnings expectations for our medicare advantage plans 

the ongoing pressure on medicare advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency there are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions in some years these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks adjust members benefits implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a countybycounty basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans 

as medicare advantage payments change other products may become relatively more attractive to medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our marketleading medicare supplement and standalone medicare part d insurance offerings 

as provided in the aca our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings the level of star ratings from cms based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses in addition star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits which ultimately may affect the plan’s membership and revenue for the 2016 payment year approximately 57 of our medicare advantage members were in plans rated four stars or higher we expect that at least 80 of our medicare advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2017 we continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance 

health insurance industry tax and premium stabilization programs  the industrywide amount of the health insurance industry tax was 113 billion in 2016 and we paid our portion of the tax which was 18 billion in september 2016 a provision in the 2016 federal budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax the health insurance industry tax is scheduled to be imposed for 2018 and beyond in 2018 the industrywide amount of the health insurance industry tax is expected to be 143 billion the aca also included three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets these programs encompassed a transitional reinsurance program a temporary risk corridors program and a permanent risk adjustment program the transitional reinsurance and temporary risk corridors programs expired at the end of 2016 

individual public exchanges in 2016 we participated in individual public exchanges in 34 states and offered individual aca compliant products we recorded a premium deficiency reserve for a portion of our estimated 2016 losses in our 2015 results 

for inforce contracts as of january 1 2016 during 2016 we incurred additional losses in our individual aca compliant products and for 2017 reduced our participation to three individual public exchanges we expect to reduce the number of consumers we serve through individual insurance plans by nearly 1 million people in 2017 which will reduce our premium revenues by more than 4 billion

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the shortterm and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each jurisdiction and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 

in 2016 our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 39 billion for the year ended december 31 2015 our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 44 billion see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of longterm debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends andor repurchases of our common stock depending on market conditions 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



2016 cash flows compared to 2015 cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities increased slightly as higher net earnings were mostly offset by increased cms receivables and other operating items 

other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included increased net purchases of investments in 2016 and the decreases in cash paid for acquisitions and proceeds from debt issuances due to the 2015 acquisition of catamaran 

2015 cash flows compared to 2014 cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 increased primarily due to growth in riskbased products which increased medical costs payable and an increase in cms risk share payables which increased other liabilities these increases were partially offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates which increased other receivables the increase in the payment of the 2015 health insurance industry tax and the payment of reinsurance program fees in 2015 

other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included increased cash paid for acquisitions and net debt issuances and decreased share repurchases all due to the catamaran acquisition 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2016  our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 367 billion  included 104 billion  of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 700 million  was available for general corporate use 242 billion  of debt securities and 20 billion  of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments venture capital funds and dividend paying stocks given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  for further detail concerning our fair value measurements 

our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 33 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2016  when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper and bank credit facilities  our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through thirdparty brokerdealers and are available for general corporate purposes for more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 55 as of december 31 2016 our debt to debtplusshareholders’ equity ratio as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was approximately 44 

longterm debt  periodically we access capital markets to issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes such as to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases in february 2016 we issued debt to repay commercial paper borrowings which were incurred for general corporate and working capital purposes and to repay our 5375 notes that were due march 15 2016 in december 2016 we issued debt to repay commercial paper borrowings which were incurred for general corporate and working capital purposes for more information on these debt issuances see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

credit ratings  our credit ratings as of december 31 2016  were as follows 

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 

share repurchase program  as of december 31 2016  we had board authorization to purchase up to an additional 51 million  shares of our common stock for more information on our share repurchase program see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

dividends in june 2016 our board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of 250  per share for more information on our dividend see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2016 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 



 we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations which include internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016 we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

recently issued accounting standards 

see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service approximately 90  of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months as of december 31 2016  our days outstanding in medical payables was 51 days calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period 

in each reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2016 2015 and 2014 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 220 million  320 million  and 420 million  respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example for the most recent two months we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors 

completion factors  a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserves may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2016    

medical cost per member per month trend factors  medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as grossdomestic product growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical and 

pharmaceutical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes and epidemics 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of december 31 2016  



the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2016  however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2016  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2016 net earnings would have increased or decreased by 90 million 

for more detail related to our medical cost estimates see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

revenues 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services 

our medicare advantage and medicare part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the cms risk adjustment payment methodology the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations the actual amount of cms’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and accordingly our profitability for more detail on premium revenues see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments including audit by regulators see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements”  for additional information regarding these audits our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum mlr rebates payable by us to cms 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill for impairment we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value during a qualitative analysis we consider the impact of changes if any to the following factors macroeconomic industry and market factors cost factors changes in overall financial performance and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform additional quantitative analysis we may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed we perform a multistep test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates for each reporting unit comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

forecasts and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategies key assumptions used in these forecasts include 

 discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unitspecific factors we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of october 1 2016 all of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values 

intangible assets  our finitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including changes in the use of the assets changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value experienced or expected operating cashflow deterioration or losses adverse changes in customer populations adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist to determine if an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value intangible assets were not impaired in 2016 

investments 

our investments are principally classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 

otherthantemporary impairment assessment   individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity given the nature of our portfolio primarily investment grade securities historical impairments were largely market related eg interest rate fluctuations as opposed to credit related our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security however our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change 

the judgments and estimates related to otherthantemporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including circumstances may change over time industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold our assessment of the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including changes to current facts and circumstances or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

concentrations of credit risk

our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real 

as of december 31 2016 we had 132 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also as of december 31 2016 124 billion of our financial liabilities which include commercial paper debt and deposit liabilities were at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2016 219 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 252 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities as well as by endeavoring to match our floatingrate assets and liabilities over time either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts unrealized gains and losses on investments in availableforsale securities are reported in comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 point or 2 points as of december 31 2016  and 2015 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 

nm  not meaningful 

 we have an exposure to changes in the value of the brazilian real to the us dollar in translation of unitedhealthcare brazil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and unitedhealthcare brazil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into us dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in brazilian real for example as of december 31 2016 a hypothetical 10 and 25 increase in the value of the us dollar against the brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately 400 million and 900 million respectively we manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies 

as of december 31 2016 we had 20 billion  of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments venture capital funds and dividend paying stocks valuations in nonus dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions

if we fail to comply with or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in applicable laws regulations and rules our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected see part i item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal state and international laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “forecast” “outlook” “plan” “project” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances including unanticipated events after the date of this report 

the following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong our forwardlooking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify 

if we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our riskbased benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased benefits products comprise over 80 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs in this regard federal and state regulatory requirements obligate our commercial medicare advantage and certain statebased medicaid health plans to maintain minimum mlrs which could make it more difficult for us to obtain price increases for our products in addition our optumcare business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial thirdparty payers under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a thirdparty payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member if we fail to predict accurately price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year although we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services natural catastrophes or other largescale medical emergencies epidemics the introduction of new or costly drugs treatments and technology new mandated benefits such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences 

between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2015 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1 higher without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2015 would have been reduced by approximately 210 million excluding any offsetting impact from reduced premium rebates due to minimum mlrs 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove inaccurate our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business 

we are regulated by federal state and local governments in the united states and other countries where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements some of our unitedhealthcare and optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and nonus selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds in addition under state guaranty association laws certain insurance companies can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies including state insurance cooperatives that write the same line or similar lines of business any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty association assessments 

certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts among others certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest these laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulations which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries including for example state telemedicine regulations debt collection laws banking regulations distributor and producer licensing requirements state corporate practice of medicine doctrines feesplitting rules health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increases to hhs for monitoring purposes on many of our products geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business these regulatory regimes encompass among other matters local and crossborder taxation licensing tariffs intellectual property investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements management control labor antifraud anticorruption and privacy and data protection regulations including requirements for crossborder data transfers that vary by jurisdiction we currently operate outside of the united states and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states increasing our exposure to nonus regulatory regimes for example our amil business subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and to 

insurance industries and regulation by brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans the agência nacional de saúde suplementar whose approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by us regulators in addition our nonus businesses and operations are subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the fcpa which prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation such as health reform legislation and associated exchanges negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

health reform legislation could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

due to its complexity ongoing implementation and continued legal challenges health reform legislation’s full impact remains difficult to predict and could adversely affect us for example health reform legislation includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace including guaranteed availability of coverage adjusted community rating requirements which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors essential health benefit requirements resulting in benefit changes for many members and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing or a combination of both for many policyholders in addition if we do not maintain certain minimum loss ratios we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers these changes can cause significant disruptions in local health care markets and adjustments to our business all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

health reform legislation required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers and requires insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges to offer a minimum level of benefits and includes guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations while risk adjustment applies to most individual and small group plans in the commercial markets actual risk adjustment calculations and transfers could materially differ from our assumptions our participation in these exchanges involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if the number of individuals who gain coverage under health reform legislation varies from our expectations if the demand for health reform legislation related products and capabilities offered by our optum businesses is less than anticipated or if our costs are greater than anticipated for a discussion of individual exchangecompliant products see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs chip and our tricare contract with the dod and receive substantial revenues from these programs certain of our optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or as is a typical feature of many government contracts termination of the contract at the option of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are possible in addition from time to time cms makes changes to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payments although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost 

management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the medicare advantage program in addition payers in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from cms as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and will not have additional members autoassigned to us in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions is materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of health reform legislation cms has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including among other things quality of care preventative services chronic illness management and customer satisfaction plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect our membership levels results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition under health reform legislation congress authorized cms and the states to implement mmp managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs including medicare medicaid and the mmp demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjusting monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for medicare advantage plans as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms 

we have been and may in the future become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review including for compliance with coding and other requirements under the medicare riskadjustment model our chart review programs and related processes such investigations audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that among other allegations we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which could result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security laws 

regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations for example the hitech amendments to hipaa imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect disclose and use sensitive personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business while we transitioned to icd10 as a hipaaregulated entity providers may use icd10 codes differently than they used icd9 codes in the past which could result in lost revenues under risk adjustment or increased medical costs for fullrisk health insurance products 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities 

hipaa requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our optum businesses including our optum labs business we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically deidentified in accordance with hipaa standards noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business including mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards among other consequences any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses 

we provide pharmacy care services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers optumrx also conducts business through home delivery and specialty pharmacies which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those of the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including potential new regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies 

our pharmacy care services businesses would be materially and adversely affected by our inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions at any of our home delivery or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa a private party or the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pharmacy care services businesses in connection with services for which our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows   could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states brazil and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate in particular markets our competitors compared to us may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional 

arrangements better existing business relationships lower profit margin or financial return expectations or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage in addition our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability additionally new directtoconsumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits health care usage and in the effective navigation of the health care system we may be challenged by new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other service providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain activities related to network design provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly distract managements’ attention and result in negative publicity 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 

the success of certain businesses including optumcare and amil depend on maintaining satisfactory physician employment relationships the primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us there is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships 

with primary care physicians or to acquire recruit or in some instances employ physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and hmo competitors of unitedhealthcare our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or hmo companies or adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows   

we are routinely subject to various litigation actions due to the nature of our business which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other matters the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort claims including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks whistleblower claims including claims under the false claims act or similar statutes contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers in addition we operate in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

we cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses 

any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to medicare beneficiaries if we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows success in completing acquisitions is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage if we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we expand and operate our business outside of the united states we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired 

businesses these challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to manage successfully our nonus acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and our future revenues costs and cash flows from international operations any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products and services are sold in part through independent producers and consultants with whom we do not have exclusive contracts and for whose services and allegiance we must compete intensely our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commissions 

a number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies’ products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services these conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hmos hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2015  relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and equity 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our equity in addition if it 

became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

as of december 31 2015  goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of 53 billion  representing 47  of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in equity could in turn adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities 

if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate integrate upgrade or expand our existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to price adequately our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or thirdparties some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the united states due to our information technology systems and international business operations we may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or 

theft coordinated attacks by activist entities misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customer’s data 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases software and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary in most states we are required to seek prior approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt and capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs

platforms unitedhealthcare which provides health care coverage and benefits services and optum which provides information and technologyenabled health services 

we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms unitedhealthcare and optum 

 further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in part i item 1 “business” and in note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the united states brazilian and certain other international health economies in the united states health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18 of gross domestic product we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations 

pricing trends  to price our health care benefit products we start with our view of expected future costs we frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve considering all relevant factors such as product positioning price competitiveness and environmental competitive legislative and regulatory considerations our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum mlr thresholds and the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions that impact the small group and individual markets we will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions 

the commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group markets we expect broadbased competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes health reform legislation included an annual nondeductible insurance industry tax health insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for riskbased health insurance products health reform legislation also included three programs designed to stabilize health insurance markets premium stabilization programs a permanent risk adjustment program a temporary risk corridors program and a transitional reinsurance program reinsurance program health plans have generally reflected the health insurance industry tax and reinsurance program together aca fees in their pricing conversely the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization which has impacted pricing trends in 2015 health plans’ pricing returned to a more normal yearoveryear inflation after pricing for higher costs due to aca fees in 2014 as always the intensity of pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics a provision in the 2016 federal budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax this will impact our pricing for contracts that renew during 2016 but cover all or portions of 2017 

medicare advantage funding continues to be pressured as discussed below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties” 

we expect continued medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve we also believe that the reimbursement rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on medicaid net margin percentages we continue to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships we advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the longterm viability of their programs 

medical cost trends our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs health system utilization and prescription drug costs consistent with our experience in recent years our 2015 cost trends were largely driven by unit cost pressures from health care providers in 2016 we expect continued unit cost pressure and a modest increase in utilization we endeavor to mitigate those increases with medical management our 2016 management activities include managing costs across all health care categories including specialty pharmacy spending as new therapies are introduced at high costs and older drugs have unexpected price increases 

delivery system and payment modernization  the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations health plans and care providers are being called upon to 

work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality improve the health of populations and reduce costs we continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentivebased care provider reimbursement models that reward highquality affordable care and foster collaboration we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients 

we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and costefficiency as of december 31 2015 we served more than 14 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement including fullrisk sharedrisk and bundled episodeofcare and performance incentive payment approaches as of december 31 2015 our contracts with valuebased spending total nearly 46 billion annually up from 13 billion in 2011 

this trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician including new primary care channels and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems which we believe provide growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of health reform legislation and other regulatory items for additional information regarding health reform legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties see part i item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 1a “risk factors” 

medicare advantage rates and minimum loss ratios  medicare advantage rates have been cut over the last several years with additional funding reductions to be phasedin through 2017 the final 2016 medicare advantage rates were more stable than in recent years with an expected average increase in industry funding of approximately 125 however these rates still trail the typical industry forward medical cost trend of 3 which creates continued pressure in the medicare advantage program the impact of these cuts to our medicare advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to medicare advantage revenues or medicare feeforservice reimbursement rates these factors affected our plan benefit designs market participation growth prospects and earnings expectations for our medicare advantage plans for 2016 

the ongoing reductions to medicare advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency there are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate reductions these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks adjust members benefits implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a countybycounty basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans 

in the longer term we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due in part to the increasing number of people eligible for medicare in coming years as medicare advantage reimbursement changes other products may become relatively more attractive to medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our marketleading medicare supplement and standalone medicare part d insurance offerings 

our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings the level of star ratings from cms based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses in addition star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits which ultimately may affect the plan’s membership and revenue beginning in 2015 quality bonus payments were paid only to plans rated 4 stars and higher we expect that approximately 56 of our medicare advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2016 compared with approximately 39 of members in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2015 we further expect that at least 63 of our medicare advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2017 we continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance 

health insurance industry tax and premium stabilization programs  the industrywide amount of the health insurance industry tax was 113 billion in 2015 and will remain at that level in 2016 a provision in the 2016 federal budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax the health insurance industry tax will again be imposed for 2018 and beyond in 2016 we expect that our share of the health insurance industry tax will increase to 19 billion from 18 billion in 2015 due to growth in our business 

the reinsurance program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and selffunded arrangements the total three year amount of 25 billion for the reinsurance 

program is allocated as follows 20 billion 2014  10 billion 2015  6 billion 2016  4 billion subject to increases based on state decisions to fund the reinsurance pool and 5 billion 2014 and 2015  2 billion 2016  1 billion to fund the us treasury the actual 2014 reinsurance program contributions totaled approximately 97 billion which was 23 billion short of the expected amount all was used to fund the reinsurance program while funding for the reinsurance program will come from all commercial lines of business only market reform compliant individual businesses will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries we have not recorded any receivables under the temporary risk corridor program for 2014 or 2015 due to uncertainty over the level of government funding for this program and the ultimate collectability of these funds 

for detail on the health insurance industry tax and premium stabilization programs see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

individual public exchanges after a measured approach to the individual public exchange market in 2014 in which we participated in only four states we expanded significantly in 2015 to participate in 23 states in 2016 we are expanding our individual public exchange offerings by 11 states to a total of 34 states recent data however has caused us to reconsider our longterm position in the individual public exchange market we have seen lower consumer participation than we and others expected lower government expectations for future consumer participation declining performance in and accelerating failures of governmentsponsored cooperatives and worsening of our own claims experience we have recorded a premium deficiency reserve for a portion of our estimated 2016 losses in our 2015 results for inforce contracts as of january 1 2016 we are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions eg increased prices and eliminated marketing and commissions to contain membership growth by mid2016 we will determine to what extent if any we will continue to offer products in the individual public exchange market in 2017

 2015 results of operations compared to 2014 results 

our results of operations during the year ended december 31 2015 were affected by our acquisition of catamaran on july 23 2015 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

the increase in revenues was primarily driven by the effect of the catamaran acquisition and organic growth in the number of individuals served across our benefits businesses and across all of optum’s businesses 

medical costs 

medical costs increased primarily due to riskbased membership growth in our benefits businesses medical costs also included losses on individual exchangecompliant products related to 2015 and the establishment of premium deficiency reserves related to the 2016 policy year for anticipated future losses for inforce individual exchangecompliant contracts and a new state medicaid contract 

operating cost ratio 

the decrease in our operating cost ratio was due to the inclusion of catamaran and growth in government benefits programs both of which have lower operating cost ratios and company wide productivity gains

unitedhealthcare 

the following table summarizes unitedhealthcare revenues by business 



the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our unitedhealthcare businesses by major market segment and funding arrangement 

the increase in commercial riskbased enrollment was the result of strong participation in unitedhealthcare’s individual public exchange products and favorable annual renewal activity and new business wins in the employer group segment medicare advantage participation increased yearoveryear primarily due to growth in people served through employersponsored group medicare advantage plans medicaid growth was driven by the combination of health reform related medicaid expansion states launching new programs to complement established programs and growth in established programs partially offset by a decrease of 175000 people in one market where an additional offering was introduced by the state in the first quarter of 2015 medicare supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales the number of people served internationally decreased yearoveryear primarily due to pricing and underwriting disciplines in brazil in response to regulatory actions and declining employment levels in brazil 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2015 was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends 

unitedhealthcare’s operating earnings for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased as the combined individual exchangecompliant losses and premium deficiency reserves totaling 815 million more than offset strong growth across the business improved medical cost management and increased productivity 

optum 

total revenues and operating earnings increased for the year ended december 31 2015 as each reporting segment increased revenues and earnings from operations by doubledigit percentages as a result of the factors discussed below 

the results by segment were as follows 

optumhealth 

revenue and earnings from operations increased at optumhealth during the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to growth in its care delivery businesses and the impact of acquisitions in patient care centers and population health management services the operating margins for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to investments made to develop future growth opportunities 

optuminsight 

revenue earnings from operations and operating margins at optuminsight for the year ended december 31 2015 increased primarily due to expansion and growth in care provider revenue management services and payer services 

optumrx 

revenue and earnings from operations for the year ended december 31 2015 increased due to the midyear acquisition of catamaran as well as strong organic growth operating margins for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased slightly due to the inclusion of lower margin catamaran business for more information about catamaran see note 3 in notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

2014 results of operations compared to 2013 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

the increases in revenues during the year ended december 31 2014 were primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses and growth across all of optum’s businesses 

medical costs and medical care ratio 

medical costs during the year ended december 31 2014 increased due to riskbased membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses to the extent possible we included the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing since the aca fees are included in operating costs this decreased our medical care ratio in 2014 this decrease from aca fees was partially offset by the impact of lower levels of favorable medical cost reserve development 

operating cost ratio 

the increase in our operating cost ratio during the year ended december 31 2014 was due to the introduction of aca fees and services business growth and acquisitions partially offset by productivity and operating performance gains 

income tax rate 

the increase in our income tax rate resulted primarily from the nondeductible health insurance industry tax 

reportable segments 

unitedhealthcare 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2014 was due to growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses revenues to recover aca fees which resulted in 15 billion of additional annual premiums in 2014 and commercial price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends these increases were partially offset by decreased commercial riskbased enrollment and a reduced level of medicare advantage funding 

unitedhealthcare’s operating earnings for the year ended december 31 2014 were pressured yearoveryear by aca fees medicare advantage funding reductions increased spending on specialty medications to treat hepatitis c and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development partially offsetting these factors were growth in our public and senior markets businesses reduced levels of permember inpatient hospital utilization and revenue trueups 

optum 

total revenues increased for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily due to pharmacy growth at optumrx and growth at optumhealth 

the increases in optum’s earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended december 31 2014 were driven by revenue growth and increased productivity partially offset by investments at optumhealth and optuminsight 

the results by segment were as follows 

optumhealth 

revenue increased at optumhealth during 2014 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in care delivery and subacute care services 

earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended december 31 2014 increased primarily due to revenue growth and cost efficiencies offset in part by investments to develop future growth opportunities 

optuminsight 

revenue earnings from operations and operating margins at optuminsight for the year ended december 31 2014 increased primarily due to the growth and expansion in revenue management services and government exchange services partially offset by a reduction in hospital compliance services and investments for future growth 

optumrx 

increased optumrx revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 was due to growth in people served in unitedhealthcare’s public and senior markets the insourcing of unitedhealthcare’s commercial pharmacy benefit programs growth from external clients and an increase in specialty pharmaceutical revenues 

earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended december 31 2014 increased primarily due to growth in scale that resulted in greater productivity and better absorption of our fixed costs and improved performance in both drug purchasing and home delivery pharmacy fulfillment 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the shortterm and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each jurisdiction and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 

in 2015 our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 44 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 46 billion see note 11 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of longterm debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our stockholders through shareholder dividends andor repurchases of our common stock depending on market conditions 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



2015 cash flows compared to 2014 cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 increased primarily due to growth in riskbased products which increased medical costs payable and an increase in cms risk share payables which increased other policy liabilities these increases were partially offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates which increased other receivables the increase in the payment of the 2015 health insurance industry tax and the payment of reinsurance program fees in 2015 

other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included increased cash paid for acquisitions and net debt issuances and decreased share repurchases all due to the catamaran acquisition 

2014 cash flows compared to 2013 cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 increased primarily due to an increased level of accounts payable and other liabilities including the collection of reinsurance program fees in advance of remittance in 2015 partially offset by an increase in government receivables 

other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included a a change in investment activity from net purchases in 2013 to net sales in 2014 b an increase in part d subsidy receivables causing a change in customer funds administered and c increased levels of cash used to repurchase common stock 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2015  our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 312 billion  included 109 billion  of cash and cash equivalents of which 286 million  was available for general corporate use 186 billion  of debt securities and 16 billion  of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments venture capital funds and dividend paying stocks given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during 

adverse market conditions see note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements 

our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 34 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2015  when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper and bank credit facilities  our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through thirdparty brokerdealers and are available for general corporate purposes for more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplusstockholders’ equity ratio of not more than 55 as of december 31 2015 our debt to debtplusstockholders’ equity ratio as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was approximately 47 

longterm debt  periodically we access capital markets and issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes for example to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases in july 2015 we issued debt to fund the acquisition of catamaran for more information on this debt issuance see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

credit ratings  our credit ratings as of december 31 2015  were as follows 

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 

share repurchase program  we expect continued moderated share repurchase activity through 2016 following the acquisition of catamaran for more information on our share repurchase program see note 11 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

dividends in june 2015 our board increased our quarterly cash dividend to stockholders to an annual dividend rate of 200  per share for more information on our dividend see note 11 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2015 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 



 we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations which include internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2015 we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

recently issued accounting standards 

see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim processing backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption health care professional contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics the introduction of new technologies benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service as of december 31 2015  our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days 

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified therefore in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2015 2014 and 2013 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 320 million  420 million  and 680 million  respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36month period a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation for months prior to the most recent three months we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicatedtodate to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months for the most recent three months we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors 

completion factors  completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods generally periods prior to the most recent three months completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserves may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2015    

medical cost pmpm trend factors  medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic 

variables such as grossdomestic product growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes and epidemics 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31 2015  

  



the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2015  developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2015  however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2015  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2015 net earnings would have increased or decreased by 83 million 

revenues 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services 

our medicare advantage and medicare part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the cms risk adjustment payment methodology the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier we and health care providers collect capture and submit available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines cms uses submitted diagnosis codes demographic information and special statuses to determine the risk score for most medicare advantage beneficiaries cms also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations the actual amount of cms’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and accordingly our profitability risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments including audit by regulators see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” for additional information regarding these audits our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum mlr rebates payable by us to cms 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of october 1 2015 all of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values during 2015 we changed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from january 1 to october 1 of each year the change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of our longterm planning process which is a significant input to the testing this change in testing date did not delay accelerate or avoid a goodwill impairment charge impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

to determine whether goodwill is impaired we perform a multistep test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates for each reporting unit comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

forecasts and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategies key assumptions used in these forecasts include 

 discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unitspecific factors we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty 

the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future 

intangible assets  our recorded separatelyidentifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and were initially recorded at their fair values finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives while indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis 

our finitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including changes in the use of the assets changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value experienced or expected operating cashflow deterioration or losses adverse changes in customer populations adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist to determine if an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value intangible assets were not impaired in 2015 

investments 

our investments are principally classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 

otherthantemporary impairment assessment   individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity given the nature of our portfolio primarily investment grade securities historical impairments were largely market related eg interest rate fluctuations as opposed to credit related in december 2015 the federal reserve fed announced that it would increase short 

term interest rates to a range between 25 and 50 basis points fed officials emphasized that they intend to raise rates gradually if necessary we estimate a 25 basis point rise in shortterm interest rates impacts the fairvalue of our investments by 200 million our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security however our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change 

the judgments and estimates related to otherthantemporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including circumstances may change over time industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold our assessment of the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including changes to current facts and circumstances or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base as of december 31 2015  we had a reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005 see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” for more information as of december 31 2015  there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real 

as of december 31 2015 we had 129 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also as of december 31 2015 129 billion of our financial liabilities which include commercial paper debt and deposit liabilities were at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2015 171 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 219 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities as well as by endeavoring to match our floatingrate assets and liabilities over time either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts unrealized gains and losses on investments in availableforsale securities are reported in comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 point or 2 points as of december 31 2015  and 2014 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 

nm  not meaningful 

 we have an exposure to changes in the value of the brazilian real to the us dollar in translation of amil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and amil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into us dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in brazilian real for example as of december 31 2015 a hypothetical 10 and 25 increase in the value of the us dollar against the brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately 300 million and 660 million respectively we manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies 

as of december 31 2015 we had 16 billion  of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments venture capital funds and dividend paying stocks valuations in nonus dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions

states using managed care services for medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts a number of factors are considered by unitedhealthcare community  state when choosing programs for participation including the state’s commitment and consistency of support for its medicaid managed care program in terms of service innovation and funding the eligible population base both immediate and long term and the structure of the projected program unitedhealthcare community  state works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends

 these health plans and care programs offered are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve including the chronically ill those with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical behavioral and social conditions unitedhealthcare community  state administers benefits for the unique needs of children pregnant women adults seniors

government regulation 

most of our health and wellbeing businesses are subject to comprehensive federal state and international laws and regulations we are regulated by federal state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules the regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system new laws regulations and rules or changes in the interpretation of existing laws regulations and rules including as a result of changes in the political climate could adversely affect our business 

if we fail to comply with or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in applicable laws regulations and rules our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected see part i item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal state and international laws and regulations 

federal laws and regulation

health care reform health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market as well as the medicaid and medicare programs chip and other aspects of the health care system 

among other requirements health reform legislation expanded dependent coverage to age 26 expanded benefit requirements eliminated certain annual and lifetime maximum limits eliminated certain preexisting condition limits required coverage for preventative services without cost to members required premium rebates if certain medical loss ratios mlrs are not satisfied granted members new and additional appeal rights created new premium rate review processes established a system of state and federal exchanges through which consumers can purchase health coverage imposed new requirements on the format and content of communications such as explanations of benefits between health insurers and their members introduced new risk sharing programs reduced the medicare part d coverage gap and reduced payments to private plans offering medicare advantage 

health reform legislation and the related federal and state regulations are affecting how we do business and could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows the full impact of health reform legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known see also part i item 1a “risk factors” and part ii item 7 “management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of the risks related to health reform legislation and related matters

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “forecast” “plan” “project” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances including unanticipated events after the date of this report 

the following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify 

if we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our riskbased benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased benefits products comprise nearly 90 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs in this regard health reform legislation established minimum mlrs for certain health plans and authorized hhs to maintain an annual price increase review process for commercial health plans which could make it more difficult for us to increase the prices of our products in addition our optumhealth local care delivery business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial thirdparty payers under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a thirdparty payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member if we fail to predict accurately price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year although we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services natural catastrophes or other largescale medical emergencies epidemics the introduction of new or costly drugs treatments and technology new mandated benefits such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2014 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1 higher without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2014 would have been reduced by approximately 190 million excluding any offsetting impact from premium rebates due to minimum mlrs 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove too low our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business 

we are regulated by federal state and local governments in the united states and other countries where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements some of our unitedhealthcare and optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and nonus selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds in addition under state guaranty fund laws certain insurance companies can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business any such assessment could expose our insurance entities to the risk of paying a portion of an insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods 

certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts among others certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest these laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulations which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries including for example fda regulations state telemedicine regulations debt collection laws banking regulations distributor and producer licensing requirements state corporate practice of medicine doctrines feesplitting rules health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products increase prices for certain regulated products and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increases to hhs for monitoring purposes on many of our products geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining 

necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

some of our businesses operate internationally and consequently face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction the regulatory environments and associated requirements and uncertainties regarding tax licensing tariffs intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements management control labor relations fraud and corruption present compliance requirements and uncertainties for us that are different from those faced by usbased businesses we have acquired and may in the future acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states which may subject us to foreign and usbased laws specific to the products and services we acquire or develop outside of the united states for example our amil business subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and insurance industries which vary from comparable us laws and regulations and to regulation by brazilian regulators whose approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by us regulators in addition our nonus businesses and operations are also subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the fcpa our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation such as health reform legislation and associated exchanges negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

health reform legislation could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

due to its complexity ongoing implementation and continued legal challenges health reform legislation’s full impact remains difficult to predict and could adversely affect us for example health reform legislation includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace including guaranteed availability of coverage adjusted community rating requirements which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors essential health benefit requirements resulting in benefit changes for many members and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing or a combination of both for many policyholders in addition if we do not maintain certain minimum loss ratios we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers these changes can cause significant disruptions in local health care markets and adjustments to our business all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

health reform legislation required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers and requires insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges to offer a minimum level of benefits and includes guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations while risk adjustment applies to most individual and small group plans in the commercial markets actual risk adjustment calculations and transfers could materially differ from our assumptions our participation in these exchanges involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition pending legal challenges to the availability of tax subsidies to participants in federal exchange marketplaces could significantly disrupt the health insurance market and negatively affect our business 

our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under health reform legislation than we expect if we are unable to attract these new individuals to our unitedhealthcare offerings or if the demand for health reform legislation related products and capabilities offered by our optum businesses is less than anticipated 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs chip and our tricare west region contract with the dod and receive substantial revenues from these programs certain of our optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or as is a typical feature of many government contracts termination of the contract for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are possible in addition from time to time cms makes changes to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payments for 2014 cms asked plans to submit additional information indicating whether or not medical conditions were diagnosed in a clinical setting cms has indicated that it will publish further guidance on the treatment of risk adjustment data in early 2015 although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the medicare advantage program in addition payers in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from cms as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and will not have additional members autoassigned to us in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions is materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of health reform legislation cms has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including among other things quality of care preventative services chronic illness management and customer satisfaction beginning in 2015 plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition under health reform legislation congress authorized cms and the states to implement mmp managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs including medicare medicaid and the mmp demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjusting monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for medicare advantage plans as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms in february 2012 cms published a final radv audit and payment adjustment methodology the methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited beginning with 2011 payments using an extrapolation of the “error rate” identified in audit samples and for medicare advantage plans after considering a feeforservice “error rate” adjuster that will be used in 

determining the payment adjustment depending on the error rate found in those audits if any potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we have been and may in the future become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review including for compliance with coding and other requirements under the medicare riskadjustment model such investigations audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that among other allegations we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which could result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations for example the hitech amendments to hipaa imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect disclose and use sensitive personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business while we have prepared for the transition to icd10 as a hipaaregulated entity if unforeseen circumstances arise it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if some providers continue to use icd9 codes on claims after october 1 2015 we will have to reject such claims which may lead to claim resubmissions increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction further providers may use icd10 codes differently than they used icd9 codes in the past which could result in lost revenues under risk adjustment during the transition to icd10 certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be reliable or available in a timely manner 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities 

hipaa requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our optum businesses including our optum labs business we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically deidentified in accordance with hipaa standards noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business including mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards among other consequences any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pbm industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products  

we provide pbm services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers optumrx also conducts business as a home delivery pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm businesses would be materially and adversely affected by our inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions at any of our home delivery or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pbm businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pbm businesses even where our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pbm businesses in connection with services for which our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows   could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states brazil and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate in particular markets our competitors compared to us may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements better existing business relationships lower profit margin or financial return expectations or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage in addition our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability additionally new direct to consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits health care usage and in the effective navigation of the health care system we may be challenged by new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other service providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain activities related to network design provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly distract managements’ attention and result in negative publicity 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which are companies that aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and 

medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 

the success of certain businesses including optumhealth local care delivery and amil depend on maintaining satisfactory physician employment relationships the primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us there is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians or to acquire recruit or in some instances employ physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and hmo competitors of unitedhealthcare our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or hmo companies or adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows   

we are routinely subject to various litigation actions due to the nature of our business which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other matters the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort claims including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks whistleblower claims including claims under the false claims act or similar statutes contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers in addition we operate in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

we cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses 

any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to medicare beneficiaries if we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows success in completing acquisitions is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage if we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we expand and operate our business outside of the united states we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses these challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to manage successfully our nonus acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and our future revenues costs and cash flows from international operations any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products and services are sold in part through independent producers and consultants with whom we do not have exclusive contracts and for whose services and allegiance we must compete intensely our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commissions 

a number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies’ products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans and our nonemployer individual plans unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services these conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including 

medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hmos hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2014  relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our net investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and shareholders’ equity 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations shareholders’ equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

as of december 31 2014  goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of 366 billion  representing 42  of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could in turn adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities 

if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate integrate upgrade or expand our existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to price adequately our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse 

consequences our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or thirdparties some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the us due to our information technology systems and international business operations we may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft coordinated attacks by activist entities misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customer’s data 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases software and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary in most states we are required to seek prior approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to 

maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt and capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs

executive overview 

general 

unitedhealth group is a diversified health and wellbeing company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone we offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms unitedhealthcare which provides health care coverage and benefits services and optum which provides information and technologyenabled health services 

we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms unitedhealthcare and optum 

 further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in part i item 1 “business” and in note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the us brazilian and certain other international health economies in the us health care spending comprises approximately 18 of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes including enacted health reform legislation in the united states which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations 

pricing trends  to price our health care benefit products we start with our view of expected future costs we frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve considering all relevant factors such as product positioning price competitiveness and environmental competitive legislative and regulatory considerations our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum mlr thresholds and the new risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions that impact the small group and individual markets we will continue to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions overall we continue to be under pressure from ongoing market competition in commercial products and from government payment rates 

the intensity of commercial pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics health plans have generally reflected the industry tax and reinsurance programs together aca fees in their pricing conversely the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization which has impacted pricing trends having reflected the additional cost stepups in 2014 related to the aca fees we anticipate health plans’ pricing returning to a more normal inflation rate in 2015 

annual commercial premium rate increases are subject to federal and state review and approval procedures while our rates and rate filings are developed using methods consistent with the standards of actuarial practice we have experienced regulatory challenges to proposed premium rate increases in certain states including california and new york 

the medicare advantage rate structure is changing and funding has been cut in recent years with additional reductions to take effect in 2015 as discussed below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties” we are taking actions to respond to these funding reductions but the reductions adversely affected aftertax earnings for our medicare business during 2014 and we expect our 

2015 medicare mlr to be slightly higher than in 2014 

we expect continued medicaid revenue increases due to anticipated growth in our offerings we also believe that the reimbursement rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on medicaid net margin percentages we continue to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships we advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the longterm viability of their programs 

medical cost trends our medical cost trends are primarily related to unit costs utilization and prescription drug costs consistent with our experience in recent years our 2014 cost trends were largely driven by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers although the weak economic environment combined with our medical cost management strategies has had a favorable impact on utilization trends in recent years the impacts of health reform legislation namely mandated essential health benefits and limits on outofpocket maximums are exerting upward pressure on medical cost trends the primary drivers of prescription drug trends continue to be unit cost pressure on brand name drugs and a shift towards expensive new specialty medications including new hepatitis c therapies 

delivery system and payment modernization  the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality improve the health of populations and reduce costs delivery system modernization and payment reform are critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme 

we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and costefficiency as of december 31 2014 we served nearly 3 million people through the most progressive of these arrangements including fullrisk sharedrisk and bundled episodeofcare payment approaches as of december 31 2014 our contracts with value based spending total nearly 37 billion annually up significantly from recent years 

this trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician including new primary care channels and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems which we believe provide growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of health reform legislation and other regulatory items for additional information regarding health reform legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties see part i item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 1a “risk factors” 

medicare advantage rates and minimum loss ratios  medicare advantage rates have been cut over the last several years with additional funding reductions to be phasedin through 2017 as a result of a changes to cms medicare advantage benchmark rates b health reform legislation and c the budget control act of 2011 as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which reduced medicare advantage and medicare part d payments sequestration the cms final notice of 2015 medicare advantage benchmark rates and payment policies includes additional significant reductions for 2015 these industry level reductions including the impact of the industry tax described below resulted in revenue reductions and incremental assessments totaling more than 6 of revenue in 2014 and more than an additional 3 in 2015 against a typical industry forward medical cost trend of 3 the impact of these cuts to our medicare advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to medicare advantage revenues or medicare feeforservice reimbursement rates these factors affected our plan benefit designs market participation growth prospects and expectation of earnings for our medicare advantage plans for 2015 

health reform legislation directed hhs to establish a program to reward highquality medicare advantage plans beginning in 2012 our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings the level of star ratings from cms based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses in addition star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan has to generate to offer supplemental benefits which ultimately may affect the plan’s membership and revenue the historical expanded star bonus program which paid bonuses to qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher expired after 2014 in 2015 quality bonus payments will be paid only to plans rated 4 stars and higher for the 2015 star bonus payment year more than 37 of our medicare advantage members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars or higher we currently expect a similar percentage of members to be enrolled in such plans for the 2016 payment year we are dedicating substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance for the 2017 and 2018 payment years 

the ongoing reductions to medicare advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency there are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate reductions these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks adjust members benefits implement or increase member premiums over the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a countybycounty basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans for 2015 we have added premiums in certain markets onethird of our members that had previously purchased 0 premium products will be impacted we may experience some reduction in membership in the plans with the greatest premiums additions but we expect overall growth in medicare advantage membership in 2015 

in the longer term we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due in part to the increasing number of people eligible for medicare in coming years as medicare advantage reimbursement changes other products may become relatively more attractive to medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our marketleading medicare supplement and standalone medicare part d insurance offerings 

industry tax and premium stabilization programs  health reform legislation includes an industry tax levied proportionally across the health insurance industry for riskbased products which began january 1 2014 the industrywide amount of the annual tax was 8 billion in 2014 and increases to 113 billion in 2015 and 2016 139 billion in 2017 and 143 billion in 2018 for 2019 and beyond the amount will equal the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year in 2015 we expect that our share of the industry tax will be 18 billion compared to 13 billion in 2014 

with the introduction of state health insurance exchanges and other significant market reforms in the individual and small group markets in 2014 health reform legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets these programs encompass a reinsurance program a temporary risk corridors program and a permanent risk adjustment program the reinsurance program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and selffunded arrangements the total three year amount of 25 billion for the reinsurance program will be allocated as follows 20 billion 2014  10 billion 2015  6 billion 2016  4 billion subject to increases based on state decisions to fund the reinsurance pool and 5 billion 2014 and 2015  2 billion 2016  1 billion to fund the us treasury while funding for the reinsurance program will come from all commercial lines of business only market reform compliant individual businesses will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries 

for detail on the industry tax and premium stabilization programs see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

exchanges and coverage expansion  across markets we and our competitors are adapting product network and marketing strategies to anticipate new or expanding distribution channels including public exchanges private exchanges and off exchange purchasing effective in 2014 states have either created their own public exchange entered a partnership exchange or relied on the federally facilitated exchange for individuals and small employers the exchanges have created new market dynamics that have impacted and could further impact our existing businesses depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market in 2014 commercial fully insured membership expanded industrywide with more than 7 million consumers served through the individual public exchanges alone selfinsured enrollment remained relatively stable but there has been an increased interest in postreform alternatives such as private exchange solutions our level of participation in public exchanges is determined on a statebystate basis each state is evaluated based on factors such as growth opportunities our current local presence our competitive positioning our ability to honor our commitments to our local customers and consumers and the regulatory environment in 2014 we participated in 13 state public exchanges including four individual and nine small group exchanges in 2015 we are participating in 23 individual exchanges and in 12 small group exchanges 

health reform legislation also provided for optional expanded medicaid coverage that became effective in january 2014 we participate in programs in 24 states and the district of columbia and of these 12 states opted to expand medicaid for 2014 for 2015 13 of our state customers have elected to expand medicaid the congressional budget office forecasts that due to medicaid expansion a total of 13 million people will have obtained coverage through medicaid by the end of 2016 and we are actively seeking to build market share serving the needs of these medicaid expansion beneficiaries and their state sponsors

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

the increases in revenues during the year ended   december 31 2014  were primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses and growth across all of optum’s businesses 

medical costs and medical care ratio 

medical costs during the year ended   december 31 2014  increased due to riskbased membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses to the extent possible we included the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing since the aca fees are included in operating costs this decreased our medical care ratio in 2014 this decrease from aca fees was partially offset by the impact of lower levels of favorable medical cost reserve development 

operating cost ratio 

the increase in our operating cost ratio during the year ended   december 31 2014  was due to the introduction of aca fees and services business growth and acquisitions partially offset by productivity and operating performance gains 

income tax rate 

the increase in our income tax rate resulted primarily from the nondeductible industry tax

unitedhealthcare 

the following table summarizes unitedhealthcare revenues by business 



nm not meaningful 

the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our unitedhealthcare businesses by major market segment and funding arrangement 

nm not meaningful 

the decrease in commercial riskbased enrollment was a result of disciplined pricing in a continued competitive environment and a decrease in individual policy customers due to customers moving to public exchanges the decrease in number of people served under commercial feebased arrangements was primarily attributable to the loss of a large state employer account medicare advantage participation increased slightly yearoveryear despite the significant funding reductions which caused us to exit certain markets in january 2014 reduce product offerings adjust networks and reduce benefits for 2014 approximately 60 of the medicaid growth was driven by medicaid expansion under the aca with the remaining growth resulting from the combination of states launching new programs to complement established programs and growth in those traditional programs medicare supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales the number of people served internationally decreased yearoveryear primarily due to price increases in brazil in response to the increasing costs of mandated health care benefits in our medicare part d standalone business the number of people served increased primarily as a result of new product introductions and strong customer retention 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2014  was due to growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses revenues to recover aca fees which resulted in 15 billion of additional annual premiums in 2014 and commercial price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends these increases were partially offset by decreased commercial riskbased enrollment and a reduced level of medicare advantage funding 

unitedhealthcare’s operating earnings for the year ended december 31 2014  were pressured yearoveryear by aca fees medicare advantage funding reductions increased spending on specialty medications to treat hepatitis c and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development partially offsetting these factors were growth in our public and senior markets businesses reduced levels of permember inpatient hospital utilization and revenue trueups 

optum 

total revenues increased for the year ended december 31 2014  primarily due to pharmacy growth at optumrx and growth at optumhealth 

the increases in optum’s earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended december 31 2014  were driven by revenue growth and increased productivity partially offset by investments at optumhealth and optuminsight 

the results by segment were as follows 

optumhealth 

revenue increased at optumhealth during 2014 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in local care delivery and subacute care services 

earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended december 31 2014  increased primarily due to revenue growth and cost efficiencies offset in part by investments to develop future growth opportunities 

optuminsight 

revenue earnings from operations and operating margins at optuminsight for the year ended   december 31 2014  increased primarily due to the growth and expansion in revenue management services and government exchange services partially offset by a reduction in hospital compliance services and investments for future growth 

optumrx 

increased optumrx revenue for the year ended   december 31 2014  was due to growth in people served in unitedhealthcare’s public and senior markets the insourcing of unitedhealthcare’s commercial pharmacy benefit programs which was completed on january 1 2014 growth from external clients and an increase in specialty pharmaceutical revenues 

earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended   december 31 2014  increased primarily due to growth in scale that resulted in greater productivity and better absorption of our fixed costs and improved performance in both drug purchasing and home delivery pharmacy fulfillment 

2013 results of operations compared to 2012 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

the increases in revenues during 2013 were primarily driven by the full year effect of 2012 acquisitions including amil growth in the number of individuals served through benefit products and overall organic growth in each of optum’s major businesses the revenue impact of these factors was partially offset by the reduction in medicare advantage rates also offsetting the revenue increase was the first quarter conversion of a large fullyinsured commercial customer from a riskbased to a feebased arrangement affecting 11 million members while this conversion reduced our fullyear 2013 consolidated revenues by 23 billion the impact to earnings from operations and cash flows was negligible 

medical costs and medical care ratio 

medical costs during 2013 increased due to riskbased membership growth in our international and public and senior markets businesses partially offset by the funding conversion of the large client discussed above the yearoveryear medical care ratio increased primarily due to funding reductions for medicare advantage products changes in business mix favoring governmental benefit programs and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development 

operating costs 

the increase in our operating costs during 2013 was due to business growth including an increase in feebased benefits and feebased service revenues and a greater mix of international business which carry comparatively higher operating costs partially offset by our ongoing cost containment efforts 

reportable segments 

unitedhealthcare 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue growth in 2013 was primarily attributable to the impact of 2012 acquisitions and the growth in the number of individuals served the effect of these factors was partially offset by the government funding reductions described previously and the customer funding conversion discussed above 

unitedhealthcare’s earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 decreased compared to the prior year as operating margins were pressured by the funding reductions that decreased revenues and by decreased levels of favorable reserve development 

optum 

total revenues increased in 2013 primarily due to broadbased growth across optum’s services portfolio with growth in each of optum’s major businesses led by pharmacy growth from the insourcing of unitedhealthcare commercial customers and external clients 

optum’s earnings from operations and operating margin in 2013 increased significantly compared to 2012 reflecting progress on optum’s plan to accelerate growth and improve productivity by strengthening integration and business alignment 

the results by segment were as follows 

optumhealth 

revenue increases at optumhealth in 2013 were primarily due to market expansion including growth related to 2012 acquisitions in local care delivery and organic growth 

earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to revenue growth and an improved cost structure across the business including local care delivery population health and wellness solutions and healthrelated financial services offerings 

optuminsight 

revenues at optuminsight in 2013 increased primarily due to the impact of a 2012 acquisition and growth in services to commercial payers 

the increases in earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 reflected increased revenues changes in product mix and continuing improvements in business alignment and efficiency 

optumrx 

the increase in optumrx revenues in 2013 were due to the insourcing of unitedhealthcare’s commercial pharmacy benefit programs and growth in both unitedhealthcare’s medicare part d members and external clients over the course of 2013 we completed our transition of 12 million migrating and new members to the optumrx platform from a thirdparty 

earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to strong revenue growth pricing disciplines and greater use of generic medications 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the shortterm and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each jurisdiction and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 

in 2014 our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 46 billion for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 our us regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 32 billion see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of longterm debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends andor repurchases of our common stock depending on market conditions 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



2014 cash flows compared to 2013 cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 increased primarily due to an increased level of accounts payable and other liabilities including the collection of reinsurance program fees in advance of remittance in 2015 partially offset by an increase in government receivables 

other significant changes in sources or uses of cash yearoveryear included a a change in investment activity from net purchases in 2013 to net sales in 2014 b an increase in part d subsidy receivables causing a change in customer funds administered and c increased levels of cash used to repurchase common stock 

2013 cash flows compared to 2012 cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2013 decreased due to the net effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities including a an increase in pharmacy rebates receivables stemming from the increased membership at optumrx the effects of which were partially offset by b increases in medical costs payable due to the growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets and international businesses 

other significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash yearoveryear included a decreased investments in acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares the activity in 2013 primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining publicly traded shares of amil during the second quarter of 2013 for 15 billion b a decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper and longterm debt as proceeds from 2013 debt issuances were fully offset by scheduled maturities and the redemption of all of our outstanding subsidiary debt in 2012 the increased cash flows from common stock issuances and proceeds from issuances of commercial paper and longterm debt primarily related to the amil acquisition and c increased net purchases of investments 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2014  our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 276 billion included 75 billion  of cash and cash equivalents of which 738 million  was available for general corporate use 186 billion  of debt 

securities and 15 billion  of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments venture capital funds and dividend paying stocks given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies especially those used in valuing our 384 million  of availableforsale level 3 securities those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs may have an effect on the estimated fair values of our investments due to the subjective nature of these assumptions the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements 

our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 34 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2014  when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper and bank credit facilities  our bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through thirdparty brokerdealers and are available for general corporate purposes for more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

our bank credit facilities contain various covenants including covenants requiring us to maintain a debt to debtplusequity ratio of not more than 50 our debt to debtplusequity ratio calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio was 349  as of december 31 2014  

longterm debt  periodically we access capital markets and issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes for example to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases 

in december 2014 we issued 20 billion in senior unsecured notes which included 750 million of 14 fixedrate notes due december 15 2017 500 million of 23 fixedrate notes due december 15 2019 and 750 million of 2875 fixedrate notes due december 15 2021 

credit ratings  our credit ratings as of december 31 2014  were as follows 

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 

share repurchase program  in june 2014 our board renewed our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million  shares of our common stock as of december 31 2014  we had board authorization to purchase up to an additional 71 million shares of our common stock for more information on our share repurchase program see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

dividends in june 2014  our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of 150  per share for more information on our dividend see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2014 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 



 we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations which include internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2014 we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

recently issued accounting standards 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” asu 201409 will supersede existing revenue recognition standards with a single model unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards eg an insurance entity’s insurance contracts the revenue recognition principle in asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition new and enhanced disclosures will be required companies can adopt the new standard using either the full retrospective approach a modified retrospective approach with practical expedients or a cumulative effect upon adoption approach asu 201409 will become effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 early adoption is not permitted we are currently evaluating the effect of the new revenue recognition guidance 

we have determined that there have been no other recently issued but not yet adopted accounting standards that will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim processing backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption health care professional contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics the introduction of new technologies benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service as of december 31 2014 our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days 

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified therefore in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2014 2013 and 2012 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 420 million  680 million  and 860 million  respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36month period a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation for months prior to the most recent three months we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicatedtodate to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months for the most recent three months we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors 

completion factors  completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods generally periods prior to the most recent three months completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserves may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2014   

medical cost pmpm trend factors  medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as grossdomestic product growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes and epidemics 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31 2014 

  



the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2014 developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2014 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2014 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2014 net earnings would have increased or decreased by 67 million 

revenues 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services 

our medicare advantage and medicare part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the cms risk adjustment payment methodology the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier we and health care providers collect capture and submit available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines cms uses submitted diagnosis codes demographic information and special statuses to determine the risk score for most medicare advantage beneficiaries cms 

also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations the actual amount of cms’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and accordingly our profitability risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments including audit by regulators see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” for additional information regarding these audits our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum mlr rebates payable by us to cms 

us commercial health plans with mlrs on fully insured products as calculated under the definitions in health reform legislation that fall below certain targets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for 

individuals are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts each period we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set eg by state group size and licensed subsidiary the most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix the estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

to determine whether goodwill is impaired we perform a multistep impairment test first we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values if the qualitative analysis is not conclusive or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates for each reporting unit comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

forecasts and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategies key assumptions used in these forecasts include 

 although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units due to the longterm nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections that uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in item 1 “business  government regulation” for additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and other factors could affect our business and the related longterm forecasts see part i item 1a “risk factors” and “regulatory trends and uncertainties” above 

discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts this risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and 

peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples beyond our selection of the most appropriate riskfree rates and equity risk premiums our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unitspecific factors such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and companyspecific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty 

the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future 

we elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of january 1 2015 all of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values 

intangible assets  our recorded separatelyidentifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and represent future expected benefits but they lack physical substance eg membership lists customer contracts trademarks and technology these intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives while indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis both finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment our most significant intangible assets are customerrelated intangibles which represent 71  of our total intangible asset balance of 37 billion  as of december 31 2014 

customerrelated intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition the most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customerrelated assets include projected revenue and earnings growth retention rates perpetuity growth rates and discount rates these initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results eg customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested 

our finitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including changes in the use of the assets changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value experienced or expected operating cashflow deterioration or losses adverse changes in customer populations adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors following the identification of any potential impairment indicators we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finitelived intangible asset or asset group using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets if it is determined that an impairment exists the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist to determine if an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value no impairment exists and no further testing is performed if we conclude otherwise we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value intangible assets were not materially impaired in 2014 

investments 

as of december 31 2014 we had investments with a carrying value of 206 billion  primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments from net earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses net of income tax effects as other comprehensive income and as a separate component in shareholders’ equity we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2014 our availableforsale investments had gross unrealized gains of 423 million  and gross unrealized losses of 66 million  

for debt securities if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security we recognize the entire impairment in earnings if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss and recognized in net earnings and all other causes and recognized in other comprehensive income 

for equity securities we recognize unrealized losses in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period if we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term we recognize the loss in net earnings 

the most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the otherthantemporary impairment assessment 

fair values fair values of availableforsale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices where available we obtain one price for each security primarily from a thirdparty pricing service pricing service which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value the pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information for securities not actively traded the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include but are not limited to benchmark yields credit spreads default rates and prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes as we are responsible for the determination of fair value we perform quarterly analyses of the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value specifically we compare 

 based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service 

otherthantemporary impairment assessment   individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity given the nature of our portfolio primarily investment grade securities historical impairments were largely market related eg interest rate fluctuations as opposed to credit related we do not expect that trend to change in the near term our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security however our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change 

our unrealized losses of 66 million  and 234 million  at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing we believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities mortgagebacked securities and corporate debt obligations substantially all of which are of investmentgrade quality securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy total otherthantemporary impairments for 2014 2013 and 2012 were 26 million  8 million  and 6 million  respectively our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2014 we have minimal securities collateralized by subprime or alta securities and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default 

the judgments and estimates related to fair value and otherthantemporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including circumstances may change over time industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold our assessment of the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including changes to current facts and circumstances or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop 

as discussed further in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” a 1 increase in market interest rates would have the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by 683 million  

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems 

the significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year a hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on our 2014 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by 97 million 

contingent liabilities 

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel if appropriate and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage if any for such matters 

estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters are inherently difficult to predict particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines penalties or punitive damages present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies are in the early stages of the proceedings or could result in a change in business practices accordingly in many cases we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred similarly the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment 

given this inherent uncertainty it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions we evaluate our related disclosures in each reporting period see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” for a discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements” 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base as of december 31 2014 we had an aggregate 18 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005 we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and record the reinsurance receivable only to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery currently the reinsurer is rated by am best as “a” as of december 31 2014 there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt b foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real and c changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 

as of december 31 2014  we had 94 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also as of december 31 2014  126 billion of our financial liabilities which include commercial paper debt and deposit liabilities were at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2014  172 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 77 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities as well as by endeavoring to match our floatingrate assets and liabilities over time either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts unrealized gains and losses on investments in availableforsale securities are reported in comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 point or 2 points as of december 31 2014  and 2013 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 

nm  not meaningful 

 we have an exposure to changes in the value of the brazilian real to the us dollar in translation of amil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and amil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into us dollars are included in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in brazilian real for example as of december 31 2014  a hypothetical 10 and 20 increase in the value of the us dollar against the brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately 430 million and 790 million respectively we manage exposure to foreign currency risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies 

as of december 31 2014  we had 15 billion  of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments venture capital funds and dividend paying stocks valuations in nonus dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions

controls and procedures 

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

in connection with the filing of this annual report on form 10k management evaluated under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2014 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2014 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 

unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries’ the “company” management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 based on our assessment and the coso criteria we believe that as of december 31 2014 the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 as stated in the report of independent registered public accounting firm appearing under item 9a which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and shareholders of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2014 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 based on the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 of the company and our report dated february 10 2015  expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

apply including the requirement to register with the board of pharmacy in the nonresident state these nonresident states generally expect our mail order pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that nonresident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there our mail order pharmacies maintain certain medicare and state medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our pbm businesses 

state privacy and security regulations a number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices for example state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to implement glba or protect credit card account data state and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information state consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers additionally different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations 

corporate practice of medicine and feesplitting laws  certain of our businesses function as direct service providers to care delivery systems and as such are subject to additional laws and regulations some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit certain entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine additionally some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice feesplitting these prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory or may be a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation these laws regulations and interpretations have in certain states been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change

cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words or phrases “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “forecast” “plan” “project” “should” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances including unanticipated events after the date of this report 

the following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify 

if we fail to effectively estimate price for and manage our medical costs the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

through our riskbased benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased benefits products comprise approximately 90 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs in this regard health reform legislation established minimum mlrs for certain health plans and authorized hhs to maintain an annual price increase review process for commercial health plans which could make it more difficult for us to price our products competitively in addition our optumhealth integrated care delivery business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial thirdparty payers under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a thirdparty payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member if we fail to accurately predict price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year although we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services natural catastrophes or other largescale medical emergencies epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2013 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1 higher without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2013 would have been reduced by approximately 200 million excluding any offsetting impact from premium rebates 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove too low our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are regulated by federal state and local governments in the united states and other countries where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements some of our unitedhealthcare and optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and nonus selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds in addition under state guaranty fund laws certain health life and accident insurance companies and in certain cases hmos can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business in these states which would expose our business to the risk of insolvency of a competitor in these states 

certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts among others certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest these laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulations which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries including for example fda regulations state telemedicine regulations debt collection laws and state corporate practice of medicine doctrines and feesplitting rules some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers additionally we participate in the emerging private exchange markets and it is not yet known to what extent the 

states will issue new regulations that apply to private exchanges these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products increase prices for certain regulated products and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance andor managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government and a number of states have enhanced or are proposing to enhance their rate review processes additionally the final market reform rules released in february 2013 require that we submit data on all proposed rate increases to hhs for monitoring purposes on many of our products moreover geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

some of our businesses and operations are international in nature and consequently face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction the regulatory environments and associated requirements and uncertainties regarding tax licensing tariffs intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements management control labor relations fraud and corruption present compliance requirements and uncertainties for us that are different from those faced by usbased businesses we have acquired and may in the future acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states for example our acquisition of amil subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and insurance industries which vary from comparable us laws and regulations and to regulation by brazilian regulators whose approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by us regulators in addition our nonus businesses and operations are also subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation such as the implementation of health reform legislation and associated exchanges negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets 

health reform legislation could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

due to its complexity and ongoing implementation health reform legislation’s impact remains difficult to predict is not yet fully known and could adversely affect us for example if we do not maintain certain minimum mlrs we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers annually beginning in 2014 commercial mlrs will need to factor in the effect of new premium stabilization provisions risk adjustment risk corridor and transitional reinsurance for individual and small group markets these factors along with uncertainties in how mlr rules may be amended to address other changes required by health reform legislation decrease the predictability of medical loss rebates some state medicaid programs are also imposing mlr requirements on medicaid mcos which generally require such plans to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their state customers if they cannot demonstrate they have met the minimum mlrs depending on our calculations of the mlr for each of our plans and the manner in which we adjust our business model in light of these requirements there could be meaningful disruptions in our market share results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

several states have indicated they may not expand their medicaid programs based on concerns over the costs of such programs when expanded federal funding is reduced starting in 2017 the extent to which states expand their medicaid programs or discontinue current expansion programs could adversely impact our medicaid enrollment levels which could in turn materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

health reform legislation also includes a “maintenance of effort” moe provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for adults covered by medicaid until the secretary of hhs determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state and for children covered by medicaid or chip through the end of the 2019 federal fiscal year 

states with or projecting a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the moe provision if states are successful in obtaining moe waivers and allow certain medicaid programs to expire we could experience reduced medicaid enrollment which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition health reform legislation requires the establishment of state based health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers by 2014 the types of exchange participation requirements ultimately enacted by each state the availability of federal subsidies for premiums and costsharing reductions within exchanges the potential for differential imposition of state benefit mandates inside and outside the exchanges the operation of reinsurance risk corridors and risk adjustment mechanisms inside and outside the exchanges and the possibility that certain states may restrict the ability of health plans to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small employers outside of the exchanges could result in disruptions in local health care markets and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

health reform legislation also includes for 2014 specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace including guaranteed availability of coverage adjusted community rating requirements which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors essential health benefit requirements resulting in benefit changes for many members and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing or a combination of both for many policyholders these changes may lead to significant disruptions in local health care markets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows further while risk adjustment will apply to most individual and small group plans in the commercial markets beginning in 2014 the availability of transitional relief makes the full extent of its impact difficult to predict and could further disrupt underlying exchange risk pools impact pricing and market strategies and result in adverse consequences to the marketplace while we have made certain assumptions in our premium rate development relating to projected risk adjustment transfers actual risk adjustment calculations and transfers could materially differ from our assumptions 

premium increases or benefit reductions will be necessary to offset health reform legislation’s impact on our medical and operating costs these premium increases are often subject to state regulatory approval and the federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by commercial health plans and providing funding to assist in those statelevel reviews if we are not able to secure approval for adequate premium increases to offset increases in our cost structure or if consumers forego coverage as a result of such premium increases our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in addition plans deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the statebased exchanges that become active under health reform legislation in 2014 

our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under health reform legislation than we expect if we are unable to attract these new individuals to our unitedhealthcare offerings or if the demand for health reform legislation related products and capabilities offered by our optum businesses is less than anticipated 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care coverage programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs chip and our tricare west region contract with the dod and receive substantial revenues from these programs we also provide services to payers through our optum businesses a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or as is a typical feature of many government contracts termination of the contract for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are expected in the next few years in addition from time to time cms makes changes to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payments for 2014 cms has asked plans to submit additional information indicating whether or not medical conditions were diagnosed in a clinical setting cms has indicated that it will publish further guidance on the treatment of risk adjustment data in early 2015 including with respect to diagnoses made during “risk assessments” that may change the way in which medicare advantage payments are determined although 

we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the medicare advantage program in addition payers in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from cms as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and will not have additional members autoassigned to us in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or other programs on which we bid or our competitors submit bids at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of health reform legislation cms has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level in addition under health reform legislation congress authorized cms and the states to implement mme managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs including medicare medicaid and the mme demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjusting monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for medicare advantage plans as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms in february 2012 cms published a final radv audit and payment adjustment methodology the methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited beginning with 2011 payments using an extrapolation of the “error rate” identified in audit samples and for medicare advantage plans after considering a feeforservice “error rate” adjuster that will be used in determining the payment adjustment depending on the error rate found in those audits if any potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we have been and may in the future become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review including for among other matters compliance with coding and other requirements under the medicare riskadjustment model such investigations audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that among other allegations we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which could result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations for example the hitech amendments to hipaa may further restrict our ability to collect disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose additional compliance requirements on our business while we have prepared for the transition to icd10 as a hipaaregulated entity if unforeseen circumstances arise it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if some providers continue to use icd9 codes on claims after october 1 2014 we will have to reject such claims which may lead to claim resubmissions increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction further providers may use icd10 codes differently than they used icd9 codes in the past which could result in lost revenues under risk adjustment during the transition to icd10 certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be reliable or available in a timely manner 

many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities 

hipaa also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result they collect use disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows     

through our optum businesses including our optum labs business we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically deidentified in accordance with hipaa standards noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business including mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards among other consequences any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pbm industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products  

we provide pbm services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers optumrx also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices 

our pbm businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pbm businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pbm businesses even where our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pbm businesses in connection with services for which our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows   could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate in particular markets our competitors compared to us may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements better existing business relationships or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage in addition our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for services our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract for these services at competitive prices any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain activities related to network design provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly distract managements’ attention and result in negative publicity 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 

the success of certain businesses including optumhealth integrated care delivery and amil depend on maintaining satisfactory physician relationships the primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician 

organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us there is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians or to acquire recruit or in some instances employ physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and hmo competitors of unitedhealthcare our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or hmo companies or to adequately price their contracts with these third party payers 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows   

because of the nature of our business we are routinely subject to various litigation actions which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties andor monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other matters the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers in addition we periodically acquire businesses or commence operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

we cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in select markets and businesses 

any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to medicare beneficiaries if we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows for acquisitions success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we continue to expand our business outside the united states acquired nonus businesses such as amil will present challenges that are different from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments that are different from those with which we are familiar in our us operations adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated benefits or synergies from the acquired businesses these challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to manage successfully our nonus acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and our future revenues costs and cash flows from international operations any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products and services are sold in part through independent producers and consultants who assist in the sales and servicing of our business we typically do not have longterm contracts with our producers and consultants who generally do not provide services to us exclusively but instead typically also market health care products and services of our competitors as a result we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract or retain independent producers and consultants or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to them regarding our product portfolio or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 

producer commissions will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other administrative costs for example such commissions are included as administrative expenses under mlr requirements of health reform legislation and therefore are not included in the minimum mlr calculation our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commissions 

a number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies’ products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment rates have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans and our nonemployer individual plans unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated andor received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hmos hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2013 relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal andor interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our net investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and shareholders’ equity 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations shareholders’ equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

goodwill and other intangible assets were 354 billion  as of december 31 2013 representing 43  of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary for example the manner in or the extent to which health reform legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in our business similarly the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could in turn adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities 

if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate integrate upgrade or expand our existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to price adequately our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer patterns if the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a thirdparty we may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft coordinated attacks by activist entities misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customer’s data 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases software and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states such as the ans in brazil we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us in most states we are required to seek prior approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 

any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s 

opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt and capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs

executive overview 

general 

unitedhealth group is a diversified health and wellbeing company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone we offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms unitedhealthcare which provides health care coverage and benefits services and optum which provides information and technologyenabled health services 

we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms unitedhealthcare and optum 

 further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in item 1 “business” and in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements” 

2014 business realignment on january 1 2014 we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves our optum business platform took responsibility for certain technology operations and business processing activities with the intention of pursuing additional thirdparty commercial opportunities in addition to continuing to serve unitedhealthcare these activities which were historically a corporate function will be included in optuminsight’s results of operations our periodic filings with the sec beginning with our first quarter 2014 form 10q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment and will continue to present the same four reportable segments unitedhealthcare optumhealth optuminsight and optumrx 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the us brazilian and certain other international health economies in the united states health care spending comprises approximately 18 of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes including enacted health care reforms in the united states which could also impact our results of operations 

pricing trends  we seek to price our health care benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends while balancing growth margins and competitive dynamics such as product positioning and price competitiveness and legislative and regulatory changes such as cost increases for the industry fees and tax provisions of health reform legislation we continue to expect premium rates to be under pressure from ongoing market competition in commercial products and from government payment rates aggregating unitedhealthcare’s businesses and before giving effect to health reform legislation taxes we believe the medical care ratio will rise over time as we continue to grow in the senior and public markets and participate in the emerging public health benefit exchange market 

in response to health reform legislation hhs established a review threshold of annual commercial premium rate increases generally at or above 10 and enacted a new rule requiring the production of information for any proposed rate increase hhs review does not supersede existing state review and approval procedures we have experienced regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states including california and new york the competitive forces common in our markets do not support unjustifiable rate increases further our rates and rate filings are developed using methods 

consistent with the standards of actuarial practices and we endeavor to sustain a commercial medical care ratio in a stable range for an equivalent mix of business we have requested and received rate increases above 10 in a number of markets due to the combination of medical cost trends and the incremental costs of health care reform we expect commercial pricing to continue to be highly competitive the intensity of pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics overall the industry has experienced lower medical costs trends due to moderated utilization which has impacted pricing trends conversely carriers are generally reflecting the 2014 health reform legislation industry fees in their pricing in some markets competitors have adjusted their pricing to reflect recent medical cost trend experience as well as the implication of rate review rules and new benefit changes from health reform legislation in other areas we are seeing greater price competition due to pricing adjustments and other varied approaches used by competitors 

the medicare advantage rate structure is changing and funding has been cut in recent years with additional reductions to take effect in 2014 and 2015 as discussed below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties” we expect these factors to result in yearoveryear pressure on gross margin percentages for our medicare business during 2014 

states are struggling to balance budget pressures with increases in their medicaid expenditures during 2013 rate changes for some medicaid programs were slightly negative yearoveryear in general we expect continued pressure on net margin percentages due to the medicaid reimbursement rate environment which we expect will remain tight due to the potential noncollectability of the insurer fee primarily related to medicare dual snp programs and medicaid we continue to work with our state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends including fees and related taxes and to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing medicaid contracts 

medical cost trends we expect our 2014 commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 60 plus or minus 50 basis points compared to approximately 5 in 2013 in 2014 we expect relatively consistent unit cost and utilization trends compared to 2013 before taking into account reform impacts the impact of health reform legislation and mandates is expected to pressure 2014 medical cost trends driving the increases are mandated essential health benefits and limits on outofpocket maximums consistent with recent years our 2014 trend is expected to be driven primarily by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers we expect 2014 pharmacy trends to be consistent with 2013 the primary drivers of prescription drug trends continue to be unit cost pressure on brand name drugs and a shift towards expensive new specialty drugs in recent years the recent weak economic environment combined with our medical cost management strategies has had a favorable impact on utilization trends we believe the expected stability in the utilization trends in 2014 is influenced by our medical management strategies our continued focus on valuebased contracting arrangements and greater consumer engagement 

delivery system and payment modernization  the health care market is changing based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care for people improve the health of populations and reduce costs the focus on delivery system modernization and payment reform is critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme 

through expansion of our existing programs and the creation of new programs we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and costefficiency as of december 31 2013 more than 2 million people we serve were directly aligned through the most progressive of these arrangements including full risk shared risk and bundled episode of care payment approaches 

this trend is also creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician including new primary care channels and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems providing growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

government reliance on private sector the government as a benefit sponsor has been increasingly relying on private sector programs we expect this trend to continue as we believe the private sector provides a more flexible better managed higher quality health care experience than do traditional passive indemnity programs typically used in governmental benefit programs 

many states are expanding their interest in managed care with particular emphasis on consumers who have complex and expensive health care needs medicaid managed care is increasingly viewed as an effective method to improve quality and manage costs for example there are nearly 10 million dually eligible beneficiaries who typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than those of a typical medicare or medicaid beneficiary similarly a small but complex group of nearly 4 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under ltc programs represent only 6 of the total medicaid population yet account for more than 30 of total medicaid expenditures the longterm care market represents a portion of the more than 15 million abd americans while these individuals’ health needs are more complex and more costly 

they have primarily been historically served in unmanaged environments these markets provide unitedhealthcare and optum with an opportunity to work with governments to improve the health status of these populations through coordination of care as of december 31 2013 unitedhealthcare served more than 275000 people in legacy dually eligible programs through medicare advantage and snps in the first half of 2014 unitedhealthcare community  state will help implement integrated mme program awards in three states 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of health reform legislation and other regulatory items for additional information regarding health reform legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties see item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 1a “risk factors” 

medicare advantage rates and minimum loss ratios  medicare advantage payment benchmarks have been cut over the last several years including 2013 with additional funding reductions to be phasedin through 2017 additionally congress passed the budget control act of 2011 which as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 triggered automatic acrosstheboard budget cuts known as sequestration including a 2 reduction in medicare advantage and medicare part d payments beginning april 1 2013 the cms final notice of 2014 medicare advantage benchmark rates and payment policies includes significant reductions to 2014 medicare advantage payments including the benchmark reductions described previously these reductions and health reform legislation insurance industry tax described below result in revenue reductions and incremental assessments totaling more than 4 in 2014 against a typical industry forward medical cost trend outlook of 3 the impact of these cuts to our medicare advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to medicare advantage revenues or medicare feeforservice reimbursement rates compared to 2013 and prior to any efforts to mitigate these funding reductions we estimate that the net impact on our 2014 consolidated aftertax earnings will be approximately 09 billion these factors affected our plan benefit designs market participation growth prospects and earnings potential for our medicare advantage plans in 2014 further beginning in 2014 medicare advantage and medicare part d plans will be required to have minimum mlrs of 85 we do not believe the minimum mlr standard will have a material impact on our earnings cms is expected to release the proposed 2015 medicare advantage rates on february 21 2014 we expect sustained medicare advantage rate pressures in 2015 due to the continuing effect of the factors described above 

health reform legislation directed hhs to establish a program to reward highquality medicare advantage plans beginning in 2012 accordingly our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on a plan’s star rating the level of star ratings from cms based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses in addition star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan has to generate to offer supplemental benefits which ultimately may affect the plan’s revenue the current expanded stars bonus program that pays bonuses to qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher is set to expire after 2014 in 2015 quality bonus payments will only be paid to 4 and 5 star plans for the 2014 payment year approximately 57 of our current medicare advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 35 stars or higher and approximately 9 are enrolled in plans that will be rated 4 stars or higher for the 2015 payment year based on scoring released by cms in october 2013 approximately 70 of our current medicare advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 35 stars or higher and approximately 24 are enrolled in plans that will be rated 4 stars or higher 

the ongoing reductions to medicare advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency there are a number of adjustments we can make and are making to partially offset these rate reductions these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks adjust members benefits implement or increase member premiums over and above the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a countybycounty basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans the depth of the underfunding of these benefits has caused us to exit certain plans and market areas for 2014 in which we served approximately 150000 medicare advantage beneficiaries in 2013 in other markets we may experience some reduction in membership in the plans with the greatest benefit cuts but expect stable or growing membership in our strongest markets we are dedicating substantial resources to improving our quality scores and star ratings to improve the performance and sustainability of our local market programs for 2016 and beyond 

in the longer term we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due in part to the increasing number of people eligible for medicare in coming years as medicare advantage reimbursement changes other products may become relatively more attractive to medicare beneficiaries increasing the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our medicare supplement and medicare part d insurance offerings 

industry fees and taxes  health reform legislation includes an annual nondeductible insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for riskbased products beginning january 1 2014 the industrywide amount of 

the annual tax is 8 billion in 2014 113 billion in 2015 and 2016 139 billion in 2017 and 143 billion in 2018 for 2019 and beyond the amount will equal the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year the annual tax will be allocated to each market participant based on the ratio of the entity’s net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance industry’s net premiums written for any us health riskbased products during the preceding calendar year subject to certain exceptions this tax will first be expensed ratably throughout 2014 and our first payment will be made in september 2014 

with the introduction of state health insurance exchanges and other significant market reforms in the individual and small group markets in 2014 health reform legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets these programs encompass a transitional reinsurance program a temporary risk corridors program and a permanent risk adjustment program the transitional reinsurance program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and selffunded arrangements 25 billion over a threeyear period beginning in 2014 of which 20 billion subject to increases based on state decisions will fund the reinsurance pool and 5 billion will fund the us treasury reinsurance program while funding for the reinsurance program will come from all commercial lines of business only nongrandfathered market reform compliant individual business will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries 

we expect our share of the industry fee to be approximately 13 billion to 14 billion in 2014 we estimate a significant increase of approximately 500 basis points in our 2014 effective income tax rate because this fee is not deductible we estimate that the 2014 effect on earnings from operations due to our tax deductible contributions to the reinsurance program will be approximately 05 billion in 2014 payable in 2015 we do not expect material payments or receipts related to the temporary risk corridors program permanent risk adjustment program or reinsurance recoveries in 2014 our 2014 results of operations will include estimates related to these fees and programs to the extent possible we include the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing which is expected to result in 14 billion to 16 billion of additional premium in 2014 since the industry fee will be included in operating costs we expect our medical care ratio to decrease in 2014 compared to historical results the industry fee cost will be factored in however when calculating minimum mlr rebates 

exchanges and coverage expansion  across markets we and our competitors are adapting product network and marketing strategies to anticipate new distribution or expanding distribution channels including public exchanges private exchanges and off exchange purchasing effective in 2014 states may create their own public exchange enter a partnership exchange or rely on the federally facilitated exchange for individuals and small employers with enrollment processes that commenced in october 2013 exchanges create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market the pace of migration in the market and the impact of the migration on our established membership for example over time certain employers may no longer offer health benefits to their employees and some employers purchasing full risk products could convert to selffunded programs our level of participation in public exchanges has been and will continue to be determined on a statebystate basis each state is evaluated based on factors such as growth opportunities our current local presence our competitive positioning our ability to honor our commitments to our local customers and members and the regulatory environment in 2014 we are participating in 13 exchanges in 10 states and the district of columbia including four individual and nine shop exchanges 

health reform legislation and related us supreme court ruling also provide for optional expanded medicaid coverage effective in january 2014 these measures remain subject to implementation at the state level with varying levels of state adoption planned for january 1 2014 we participate in programs in 24 states and the district of columbia and of these more than half have opted to expand medicaid 

individual  small group market reforms  health reform legislation includes several provisions for most individual and small group plans with plan years beginning on january 1 2014 that are expected to alter the individual and small group marketplace including among other matters 1 adjusted community rating requirements which will change how individual and small group plans are priced in many states 2 essential health benefit requirements which will result in benefit changes for many individual and small group policyholders 3 actuarial value requirements which will significantly impact benefit designs in the individual market such as member cost sharing requirements and 4 guaranteed issue requirements which will require carriers to provide coverage to any qualified group or individual these changes have resulted in significant benefit design and pricing changes for a substantial portion of the fully insured individual and small group markets in 2014 we expect a decrease in individual membership due to a reduction in the number of states in which we will offer policies to new customers

2013 results of operations compared to 2012 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

the increases in revenues during 2013  were primarily driven by the full year effect of 2012 acquisitions including amil growth in the number of individuals served through benefit products and overall organic growth in each of optum’s major businesses the revenue impact of these factors was partially offset by the reduction in medicare advantage rates also offsetting the revenue increase was the first quarter conversion of a large fullyinsured commercial customer from a riskbased to a feebased arrangement affecting 11 million members while this conversion reduced our fullyear 2013 consolidated revenues by 23 billion the impact to earnings from operations and cash flows was negligible 

medical costs and medical care ratio 

medical costs during 2013  increased due to riskbased membership growth in our international and public and senior markets businesses partially offset by the funding conversion of the large client discussed above the yearoveryear medical care ratio increased primarily due to funding reductions for medicare advantage products changes in business mix favoring governmental benefit programs and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development for the year ended december 31 2013  of 680 million  compared to 860 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

operating costs 

the increase in our operating costs during 2013  was due to business growth including an increase in feebased benefits and feebased service revenues and a greater mix of international business which carry comparatively higher operating costs partially offset by our ongoing cost containment efforts

unitedhealthcare 

the following table summarizes unitedhealthcare revenue by business 



nm not meaningful 

the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our unitedhealthcare businesses by major market segment and funding arrangement 



nm not meaningful 

the number of people served under commercial riskbased arrangements decreased in 2013 primarily due to the conversion of 11 million riskbased consumers of a large public sector client to a feebased arrangement the number of individuals in commercial feebased arrangements increased due to this conversion as well as new business awards and strong customer retention on april 1 2013 unitedhealthcare military  veterans began service under the tricare west region managed care support contract this administrative services contract for health care operations added 29 million people and includes a transition period and five oneyear renewals at the government’s option medicare advantage participation increased due to solid execution in product design marketing and local engagement which drove sales growth medicaid growth was due to a combination of winning new state accounts and growth within existing state customers partially offset by the first quarter 2013 divestiture of our medicaid business in south carolina and a fourth quarter 2012 market withdrawal from one product in wisconsin which combined affected 235000 medicaid beneficiaries medicare supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales in our medicare part d standalone business the number of people served increased primarily as a result of new product introductions and strong customer retention in the market international represents commercial customers in brazil added in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the amil acquisition and subsequent organic growth 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue growth in 2013  was primarily attributable to the impact of 2012 acquisitions and the growth in the number of individuals served the effect of these factors was partially offset by the government funding reductions described previously and the customer funding conversion discussed above 

unitedhealthcare’s earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013  decreased compared to the prior year as operating margins were pressured by the funding reductions that decreased revenues and by decreased levels of favorable reserve development 

optum 

total revenues increased in 2013  primarily due to broadbased growth across optum’s services portfolio with growth in each of optum’s major businesses led by pharmacy growth from the insourcing of unitedhealthcare commercial customers and external clients

optumrx 

the increase in optumrx revenues in 2013  were due to the insourcing of unitedhealthcare’s commercial pharmacy benefit programs and growth in both unitedhealthcare’s medicare part d members and external clients over the course of 2013 we completed our transition of 12 million migrating and new members to the optumrx platform from a third party 

earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013  increased primarily due to strong revenue growth pricing disciplines and greater use of generic medications 

2012 results of operations compared to 2011 results 

c onsolidated financial results 

revenues 

revenue increases in 2012 were driven by growth in the number of individuals served and premium rate increases related to underlying medical cost trends in our unitedhealthcare businesses and growth in our optum health service and technology offerings 

medical costs 

medical costs increased in 2012 due to riskbased membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses unit cost inflation across all businesses and continued moderate increases in health system use partially offset by an increase in favorable medical reserve development unit cost increases represented the primary driver of our medical cost trend with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals 

operating costs 

the increases in operating costs for 2012 were due to business growth including increases in revenues from unitedhealthcare feebased benefits and optum services which carry comparatively higher operating costs as well as investments in the optumrx pharmacy management services and unitedhealthcare military  veterans businesses 

income tax rate 

the increase in our effective income tax rate for 2012 was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2011 which lowered the 2011 effective income tax rate 

reportable segments 

unitedhealthcare 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue growth in 2012 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served commercial premium rate increases related to expected increases in underlying medical cost trends and the impact of lower premium rebates 

unitedhealthcare’s earnings from operations for 2012 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the factors that increased revenues combined with an improvement in the medical care ratio that was driven by effective management of medical costs and increased favorable medical reserve development the favorable development for 2012 was driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels and increased efficiency in claims handling and processing 

optum  total revenues increased in 2012 due to business growth and 2011 acquisitions at optumhealth partially offset by a reduction in pharmacy service revenues related to reduced levels of unitedhealthcare medicare part d prescription drug membership and related prescription volumes 

optum’s earnings from operations and operating margin for 2012 increased compared to 2011 due to improvements in operating cost structure stemming from advances in business simplification integration and overall efficiency and revenue growth in higher margin products

the increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 reflect an improved mix of services and advances in operating efficiency and cost management 

optumrx 

the decreases in optumrx revenues in 2012 were due to the reduction in unitedhealthcare medicare part d plan participants 

optumrx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 decreased primarily due to decreased prescription volume in the medicare part d business and investments to support growth initiatives which were partially offset by earnings contributions from specialty pharmacy growth and greater use of generic medications 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the shortterm and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each jurisdiction and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies in the united states most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the naic except in the case of extraordinary dividends these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus these dividends are referred to as “ordinary 

dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval if the dividend together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus the entire dividend is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval 

in 2013 based on the 2012 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid by our us regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was 43 billion  in 2013  our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 32 billion  including 430 million  of extraordinary dividends this level of dividends maintained our target consolidated riskbased capital level in 2012  our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 49 billion  including 12 billion  of extraordinary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of longterm debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends andor repurchases of our common stock depending on market conditions 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash 



nm not meaningful 

2013 cash flows compared to 2012 cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2013 decreased due to the net effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities including a an increase in pharmacy rebates receivables stemming from the increased membership at optumrx the effects of which were partially offset by b increases in medical costs payable due to the growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets and international businesses 

other significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash yearoveryear included a decreased investments in acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares the activity in 2013 primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining publicly traded shares of amil during the second quarter of 2013 for 15 billion b a decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper and longterm debt as proceeds from 2013 debt issuances were fully offset by scheduled maturities and the redemption of all of our outstanding subsidiary debt in 2012 the increased cash flows from common stock issuances and proceeds from issuances of commercial paper and longterm debt primarily related to the amil acquisition and c increased net purchases of investments 

2012 cash flows compared to 2011 cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities for 2012 increased due to increased net income and related tax accruals which were partially offset by the payment in 2012 of 2011 premium rebate obligations as 2012 was the first year in which rebate payments were made under health reform legislation 

other significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash yearoveryear included a increased investments in acquisitions in 2012 b increases in longterm debt commercial paper and common stock issuances primarily related to the amil acquisition c increases in cash paid for customer funds related to medicare part d and increased shareholder dividend payments 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2013  our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 283 billion  included 73 billion  of cash and cash equivalents of which 10 billion  was available for general corporate use 194 billion  of debt securities and 16 billion  of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies especially those used in valuing our 311 million  of availableforsale level 3 securities those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments due to the subjective nature of these assumptions the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements 

our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 25 years our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 36  years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2013  included in the debt securities balance was 14 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers the weightedaverage credit rating of these securities with and without the guarantee was “aa” as of december 31 2013  we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor neither indirect through the guarantees nor direct through investment in the guarantor when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper  we maintain a 40 billion commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through thirdparty brokerdealers the commercial paper program is supported by the bank credit facilities described below as of december 31 2013  we had 11 billion  of commercial paper outstanding at a weightedaverage annual interest rate of 02  

bank credit facilities   we have 30 billion  fiveyear and 10 billion  364day revolving bank credit facilities with 23  banks which mature in november 2018  and november 2014  respectively these facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes there were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of december 31 2013  the interest rates on borrowings are variable depending on term and are calculated based on the libor plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings as of december 31 2013  the annual interest rates on both bank credit facilities had they been drawn would have ranged from 10  to 12  

our bank credit facilities contain various covenants including covenants requiring us to maintain a debt to debtplusequity ratio of not more than 50 our debt to debtplusequity ratio calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio was 344  as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of december 31 2013  

longterm debt  periodically we access capital markets and issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes for example to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases 

in february 2013 we issued 225 billion in senior unsecured notes which included 250 million of floatingrate notes due august 2014 500 million of 1625 fixedrate notes due march 2019 750 million of 2875 fixedrate notes due march 2023 and 750 million of 4250 fixedrate notes due march 2043 

in march and april of 2013 we redeemed all of our outstanding subsidiary variable rate debt for 619 million 

credit ratings  our credit ratings at december 31 2013  were as follows 



the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital we have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital 

share repurchase program under our board of directors’ authorization we maintain a share repurchase program the objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize our capital structure and cost of capital thereby improving returns to shareholders as well as to offset the dilutive impact of sharebased awards repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions including structured share repurchase programs subject to certain board restrictions in june 2013 our board renewed and expanded our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million  shares of our common stock as of december 31 2013  we had board authorization to purchase up to an additional 83 million shares of our common stock 

dividends in june 2013  our board of directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of 112  per share paid quarterly since june 2012  we had paid an annual cash dividend of 085  per share paid quarterly declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change 

amil tender offer  we acquired all of amil’s remaining public shares for 15 billion in the second quarter of 2013 bringing our ownership in amil to 90 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2013 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 



 41 

 we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations which include internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2013 we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

recently issued accounting standards 

we have determined that there have been no recently issued but not yet adopted accounting standards that will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim processing backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption health care professional contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics the introduction of new technologies benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service as of december 31 2013 our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days 

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified therefore in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2013 2012 and 2011 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 680 million  860 million  and 720 million  respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36month period a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated 

by us at the date of estimation for months prior to the most recent three months we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicatedtodate to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months for the most recent three months we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors 

completion factors  completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods generally periods prior to the most recent three months completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserves may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2013   

medical cost pmpm trend factors  medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as grossdomestic product growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes and epidemics 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31 2013 

  



the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2013 developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2013 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2013 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare 

supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2013 net earnings would have increased or decreased by 65 million 

revenues 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services 

our medicare advantage and medicare part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under cms’ risk adjustment payment methodology the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier we and health care providers collect capture and submit available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines cms uses submitted diagnosis codes demographic information and special statuses to determine the risk score for most medicare advantage beneficiaries cms also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations the actual amount of cms’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and accordingly our profitability risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments including audit by regulators see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” for additional information regarding these audits additionally beginning in 2014 medicare advantage and medicare part d plans will be subject to a minimum mlr threshold of 85 we will include in our estimates of premiums to be recognized the expected premium minimum mlr rebates if any 

us commercial health plans with mlrs on fully insured products as calculated under the definitions in health reform legislation that fall below certain targets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for 

individuals are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts each period we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set eg by state group size and licensed subsidiary the most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix the estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

to determine whether goodwill is impaired we perform a multistep impairment test first we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values if the qualitative analysis is not conclusive or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates for each reporting unit comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

forecasts and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategies key assumptions used in these forecasts include 

 44 

similar factors including historical and expected medical cost trend levels are considered in estimating our longterm medical trends at the reporting unit level 

 although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units due to the longterm nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections that uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in item 1 “business  government regulation” for additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and other factors could affect our business and the related longterm forecasts see item 1a “risk factors” in part i and “regulatory trends and uncertainties” above 

discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts this risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples beyond our selection of the most appropriate riskfree rates and equity risk premiums our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unitspecific factors such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and companyspecific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty 

the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future 

we elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of january 1 2014 all of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values 

intangible assets  our recorded separatelyidentifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and represent future expected benefits but they lack physical substance eg membership lists customer contracts trademarks and technology these intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives while indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis both finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment our most significant intangible assets are customerrelated intangibles which represent 73  of our total intangible asset balance of 38 billion  as of december 31 2013 

customerrelated intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition the most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customerrelated assets include projected revenue and earnings growth retention rates perpetuity growth rates and discount rates these initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results eg customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested 

our finitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including changes in the use of the assets changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value experienced or expected operating cashflow deterioration or losses adverse changes in customer populations adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors following the identification of any potential impairment indicators we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finitelived intangible asset or asset group using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets if it is determined that an impairment exists the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist to determine if an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value no impairment exists and no further testing is performed if we conclude otherwise we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value intangible assets were not materially impaired in 2013 

investments 

as of december 31 2013 we had investments with a carrying value of 215 billion  primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments from net earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses net of income tax effects as other comprehensive income and as a separate component in shareholders’ equity we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2013 our availableforsale investments had gross unrealized gains of 326 million  and gross unrealized losses of 234 million  

for debt securities if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security we recognize the entire impairment in earnings if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss and recognized in net earnings and all other causes and recognized in other comprehensive income 

for equity securities we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period if we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term we recognize the impairment in net earnings 

the most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the otherthantemporary impairment assessment 

fair values fair values of availableforsale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices where available we obtain one price for each security primarily from a thirdparty pricing service pricing service which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value the pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information for securities not actively traded the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include but are not limited to benchmark yields credit spreads default rates and prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes as we are responsible for the determination of fair value we perform quarterly analyses of the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value specifically we compare 

 based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service 

otherthantemporary impairment assessment   individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity given the nature of our portfolio primarily investment grade securities historical impairments were largely market related eg interest rate fluctuations as opposed to credit related we do not expect that trend to change in the near term our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security however our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change 

the unrealized losses of 234 million  and 9 million  at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing we believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities mortgagebacked securities and corporate debt obligations substantially all of which are of investmentgrade quality securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy total otherthantemporary impairments during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 8 million  6 million  and 12 million  respectively our availableforsale debt portfolio had a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2013 we have minimal securities collateralized by subprime or alta securities and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default 

the judgments and estimates related to fair value and otherthantemporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including circumstances may change over time industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold our assessment of the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including changes to current facts and circumstances or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop 

as discussed further in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” a 1 increase in market interest rates would have the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by 756 million  

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems 

the significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year a hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on our 2013 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by 89 million 

contingent liabilities 

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel if appropriate and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage if any for such matters 

estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters are inherently difficult to predict particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines penalties or punitive damages present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies are in the early stages of the proceedings or could result in a change in business practices accordingly in many cases we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred similarly the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment 

given this inherent uncertainty it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions we evaluate our related disclosures in each reporting period see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” for a discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and 

other customers that constitute our client base as of december 31 2013  we had an aggregate 18 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005 we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and record the reinsurance receivable only to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery currently the reinsurer is rated by am best as “a” as of december 31 2013  there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt b foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real and c changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 

as of december 31 2013  we had 87 billion  of cash cash equivalents and investments on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also 96 billion of our commercial paper debt and deposit liabilities as of december 31 2013  were at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2013  185 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 102 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities as well as by endeavoring to match our floatingrate assets and liabilities over time either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts 

the following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 or 2 as of december 31 2013  on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 



nm  not meaningful 

 we have an exposure to changes in the value of the brazilian real to the us dollar in translation of amil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and amil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars are included in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in brazilian real for example as of december 31 2013  a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against the 

brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately 490 million we manage exposure to foreign currency risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies 

as of december 31 2013  we had 16 billion  of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in nonus dollar fixedincome funds employee savings plan related investments private equity funds and dividend paying stocks valuations in nonus dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates valuations in private equity are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions

in connection with the filing of this annual report on form 10k management evaluated under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2013 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2013 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 

unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries’ the “company” management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 1992 based on our assessment and the coso criteria we believe that as of december 31 2013 the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 as stated in the report of independent registered public accounting firm appearing under item 9a which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and shareholders of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2013 based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 1992  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 1992  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2013 of the company and our report dated   february 12 2014   expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

government regulation 

most of our health and wellbeing services are regulated by us federal and state as well as nonus regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically the patient protection and affordable care act and a reconciliation measure the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we refer to together as the health reform legislation were signed into law in the first quarter of 2010 and after being 

challenged were substantially upheld in a us supreme court decision in the second quarter of 2012 the health reform legislation portions of which are summarized below alters the regulatory environment in which we operate in some cases to a significant degree us federal and state governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system new laws regulations and rules or changes in the interpretation of existing laws regulations and rules as well as a result of changes in the political climate could adversely affect our business 

in the event we fail to comply with or we fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in applicable laws regulations and rules our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal state and international laws and regulations 

health care reforms 

the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market as well as the medicaid and medicare programs chip and other aspects of the health care system certain provisions of the health reform legislation have already taken effect and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years the us department of labor dol hhs and the us treasury department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation remain pending 

the following outlines certain provisions of the health reform legislation that are currently effective currently effective with phased implementation or are expected to take effect in the coming years 

 commercial fully insured health plans in the large employer group small employer group and individual markets with medical loss ratios below certain targets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for individuals as calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and regulations subject to state specific exceptions are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually 

the health reform legislation also mandated certain changes to coverage determination and appeals processes including expanding the definition of “adverse benefit determination” to include rescissions extending external review rights of adverse benefit determinations to insured and selffunded plans and improving the clarity of and expanding the types of information in adverse benefit determination notices 

 in addition as required under the health reform legislation hhs established a federal premium rate review process which generally applies to proposed rate increases equal to or exceeding 10 the regulations further require commercial health plans to provide to the states and hhs extensive information supporting any rate increases subject to the new federal rate review process the regulations clarify that hhs review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes but plans deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the statebased exchanges that are scheduled to become active under the health reform legislation in 2014 under current regulations the hhs rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets 

  cms reduced or froze benchmarks which affect our medicare advantage reimbursements from cms between 2009 and 2011 and in 2012 additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks began to take effect benchmarks will ultimately range from 95 of medicare feeforservice rates in high cost areas to 115 in low cost areas with changes continuing to be phasedin over the next one to five years depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county in addition to other measures quality bonuses may partially offset these anticipated benchmark reductions cms quality rating 

bonuses are paid to certain qualifying plans for a three year period that began in 2012 quality bonuses are based upon star ratings at the local plan level as determined by cms and are dependent on numerous factors including member satisfaction and member behavior in the context of obtaining preventive screens 

 the health reform legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments increase our medical and administrative costs expose us to an increased risk of liability including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our results of operations financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by such changes the health reform legislation may also create new or expand existing opportunities for business growth but due to its complexity the impact of the health reform legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known see also item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to the health reform legislation and related matters 

other federal laws and regulation 

we are subject to various levels of us federal regulation for example when we contract with the federal government we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts cms regulates our unitedhealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our optum businesses our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement unitedhealthcare community  state and optumhealth businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms also has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care given to medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2014 our commercial business may be subject to audit related to the risk adjustment and reinsurance data see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” and item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of audits by cms 

our unitedhealthcare reportable segment through unitedhealthcare community  state also has medicaid and chip contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services and other aspects of these programs there are many regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs has become and will continue to become increasingly complex as a result of the health reform legislation in addition our unitedhealthcare military  veterans business and certain of optum’s businesses hold contracts with federal agencies including the dod and we are subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of these contracts 

certain of unitedhealthcare’s and optum’s businesses such as unitedhealthcare’s eyeglass manufacturing activities and optum’s high acuity clinical workflow software hearing aid products and clinical research activities are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and the clinical research activities are also subject to laws and regulations outside of the united states that regulate clinical trials laws and regulations relating to consumer protection antifraud and abuse antikickbacks false claims prohibited referrals inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services antimoney laundering securities and antitrust also affect us 

hipaa glba and other privacy and security regulation the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended hipaa apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets including selffunded employee benefit plans hipaa requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers and certain eligible individuals it also requires guaranteed renewability for employers and individuals and limits exclusions based on preexisting conditions federal regulations related to hipaa include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information the hipaa privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us 

federal privacy and security requirements change frequently because of legislation regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation for example the us congress enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra which significantly amends and adds new privacy and security provisions to hipaa and imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information arra includes new contracting requirements for hipaa business associate agreements extends parts of hipaa privacy and security provisions to business associates adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to hhs and the federal trade commission ftc and in some cases to the local media strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for hipaa violations and in certain cases imposes criminal penalties for individuals including employees in january 2013 hhs issued its final regulations implementing the arra amendments to hipaa and updating the hipaa privacy security and enforcement rules in the conduct of our business we may act depending on the circumstances as either a covered entity or a business associate federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws including the grammleachbliley act glba or state statutes implementing glba which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with hipaa glba and other privacyrelated regulations 

erisa the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employersponsored health benefit plans erisa is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the dol as well as the federal courts erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans particularly those that maintain selffunded plans regulations established by the dol provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by erisa additionally some states require licensure or registration of companies providing thirdparty claims administration services for health care plans 

state laws and regulation 

health care regulation  our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate those products and operations these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted model regulations that when implemented by states would require certain governance practices substantially similar to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and expand insurance company and hmo risk and solvency assessment reporting we expect that states will adopt these or similar measures over the next few years expanding the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of hmos and insurance companies certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum medical loss ratios with which health plans must comply in addition a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the health reform legislation we expect the states to continue to introduce and pass similar laws in 2013 and this will affect our operations and our financial results 

health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state 

insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates these laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies 

in addition some of our business and related activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including ppo managed care organization mco utilization review ur or tparelated regulations and licensure requirements these regulations differ from state to state and may contain network contracting product and rate and financial and reporting requirements there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services appeals grievances and payment of claims adequacy of health care professional networks fraud prevention protection of consumer health information pricing and underwriting practice and covered benefits and services state health care antifraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members billing unnecessary medical services and improper marketing certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent broker and sales distributions laws and regulations our unitedhealthcare community  state unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and certain optum businesses are subject to regulation by state medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our medicaid and chip beneficiaries and to our dually eligible beneficiaries we also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of state government contracts 

guaranty fund assessments   under state guaranty fund laws certain insurance companies and hmos in some states including those issuing health longterm care life and accident insurance policies doing business in those states can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business assessments generally are based on a formula relating to premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 

pharmacy regulation optumrx’s mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our mail order pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state our mail order pharmacies maintain certain medicare and state medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our pbm businesses 

privacy and security laws states have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the glba like hipaa glba allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection a number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices for example state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to protect credit card account data state and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information state consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers additionally different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and securityrelated regulations 

corporate practice of medicine and feesplitting laws  certain of our businesses function as direct service providers to care delivery systems and as such are subject to additional laws and regulations some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit certain entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine additionally some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice feesplitting these prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory or may be a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation these laws regulations and interpretations have in certain states been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change 

consumer protection laws  certain businesses participate in directtoconsumer activities and are subject to emerging regulations applicable to online communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations

certain of our businesses and operations are international in nature and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business these regulatory regimes encompass tax licensing tariffs intellectual property investment management control labor antifraud anticorruption and privacy and data protection regulations including requirements for crossborder data transfers that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction among other matters we have recently acquired and may in the future acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states increasing our exposure to nonus regulatory regimes for example our acquisition of amil subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and insurance industries and regulation by brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans the agência nacional de saúde suplementar ans whose approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by us regulators for more information about the amil acquisition see note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statement included in item 8 “financial statements” in addition our nonus businesses and operations are also subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act 

audits and investigations 

we have been and may in the future become involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments state attorneys general the office of the inspector general oig the office of personnel management the office of civil rights the ftc us congressional committees the us department of justice doj us attorneys the securities and exchange commission sec the brazilian securities regulator the comissão de valores mobiliários cvm the internal revenue service irs the brazilian federal revenue service  the secretaria da receita federal srf the dol the fdic and other governmental authorities certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review including for among other things compliance with coding and other requirements under the medicare riskadjustment model such government investigations audits and reviews can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation audit results or sanctions could adversely affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services while retaining our current business 

competition 

as a diversified health and wellbeing services company we operate in highly competitive markets our competitors include managed health care companies insurance companies hmos tpas and business services outsourcing companies health care professionals that have formed networks to directly contract with employers or with cms specialty benefit providers government entities disease management companies and various health information and consulting companies for our unitedhealthcare businesses competitors include aetna inc cigna corporation coventry health care inc health net inc humana inc kaiser permanente wellpoint inc numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and with respect to our brazilian operations several established competitors in brazil and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas for our optumrx businesses competitors include cvs caremark corporation express scripts inc and catamaran corporation our optumhealth and optuminsight reportable segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses new entrants into the markets in which we compete as well as consolidation within these markets also contribute to a competitive environment we believe the principal competitive factors that can impact our businesses relate to the sales marketing and pricing of our products and services product innovation consumer engagement and satisfaction the level and quality of products and services care delivery network and clinical management capabilities market share product distribution systems efficiency of administration operations financial strength and marketplace reputation if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected see item 1a “risk factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to competition

cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections guidance or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words or phrases “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “plan” project” “should” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements 

the following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address or update forwardlooking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications 

if we fail to effectively estimate price for and manage our medical costs the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

under our riskbased benefit product arrangements we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased benefits products comprise approximately 90 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of these products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs in this regard the health reform legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for certain health plans and authorized hhs to maintain an annual price increase review process for commercial health plans which could make it more difficult for us to price our products competitively see the risk factor below relating to health care reform for further discussion of these provisions in addition our optumhealth collaborative care business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third party payers under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third party payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member if we fail to accurately predict price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each 

service our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period however many factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include medical cost inflation increased use of services increased cost of individual services natural catastrophes or other largescale medical emergencies epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if our 2012 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1 higher without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2012 would have been reduced by approximately 215 million excluding any offsetting impact from premium rebates 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove too low our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos utilization review and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements some of our unitedhealthcare and optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to us federal and state and nonus selfreferral antikickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claims debt collection and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds in addition under state guaranty fund laws certain health life and accident insurance companies and in certain cases hmos can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business in these states which would expose our business to the risk of insolvency of a competitor in these states 

certain of our optum businesses are also subject to regulatory and other risks and uncertainties some of which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiaries including for example fda regulations state telemedicine regulations and state corporate practice of medicine doctrines and feesplitting rules some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers additionally optumhealth participates in the emerging private exchange markets and it is not yet known to what extent the states will issue new regulations that apply to private exchanges these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted margins or increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us the broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products increase prices for certain regulated products and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance andor managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government and a number of states have enhanced or are proposing to enhance their rate review processes in addition geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

some of our businesses and operations are international in nature and consequently face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction the regulatory environments and associated requirements and uncertainties regarding tax licensing tariffs intellectual property privacy data protection investment management control labor relations fraud and corruption present compliance requirements and uncertainties for us that are different from those faced by usbased businesses we have recently acquired and may in the future acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the united states for example our acquisition of amil in october 2012 

subjects us to brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and insurance industries which vary from comparable us laws and regulations and regulation by brazilian regulators whose approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by us regulators for more information about the amil acquisition see note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” in addition our nonus businesses and operations are also subject to us laws that regulate the conduct and activities of usbased businesses operating abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act our failure to comply with us or nonus laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of governmental investigations adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price damage our reputation in various markets or foster an increasingly active regulatory environment which in turn could further increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and our costs of doing business 

for a discussion of various laws and regulations that impact our businesses see item 1 “business  government regulation” 

the implementation of the health reform legislation and other reforms could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market as well as the medicaid and medicare programs chip and other aspects of the health care system among other things the health reform legislation includes guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded establishes minimum medical loss ratios creates a federal premium review process imposes new requirements on the format and content of communications such as explanations of benefits or eobs between health insurers and their members grants to members new and additional appeal rights imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits reduces the medicare part d coverage gap and reduces payments to private plans offering medicare advantage 

certain provisions of the health reform legislation have already taken effect and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years hhs the dol and the treasury department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation remain pending due to the complexity of the health reform legislation the impact of the health reform legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known for example effective in 2011 the health reform legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for all commercial health plans in the large employer group small employer group and individual markets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for individuals calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and regulations subject to state specific exceptions companies with medical loss ratios below these targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually the medical loss ratios that determine the size of the rebates will be measured by state by group size and by licensed subsidiary this disaggregation of insurance pools into much smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in the estimates of rebates owed in total effective in 2014 medicare advantage plans will be required to maintain a minimum medical loss ratio of 85 although the rules expected to set forth the basis for calculating this medical loss ratio have not yet been issued some state medicaid programs are also imposing medical loss ratio requirements on medicaid managed care organizations which generally require such plans to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their state customers if they cannot demonstrate they have met the minimum medical loss ratios depending on our calculations of the medical loss ratios for each of our plans and the manner in which we adjust our business model in light of these requirements there could be meaningful disruptions in local health care markets and our market share results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition the health reform legislation requires the establishment of statebased health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers by 2014 the types of exchange participation requirements ultimately enacted by each state the availability of federal subsidies for premiums and costsharing reductions within exchanges the potential for differential imposition of state benefit mandates inside and outside the exchanges the operation of reinsurance risk corridors and risk adjustment mechanisms inside and outside the exchanges and the possibility that certain states may restrict the ability of health plans to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small employers outside of the exchanges could result in disruptions in local health care markets and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the health reform legislation also includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace scheduled to take effect in january 2014 including adjusted community rating requirements which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors essential health benefit requirements expected to result in benefit changes for many members and actuarial value requirements likely to result in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing or a combination of both for some policyholders although hhs issued proposed regulations related to these provisions in late 2012 the federal regulations 

are not yet final and most states have not issued implementing regulations or guidance with respect to these provisions depending on the timing and outcome of the final federal regulations and required state regulations or guidance there could be disruptions in local health care markets and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the health reform legislation includes a “maintenance of effort” moe provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for adults covered by medicaid until the secretary of hhs determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state scheduled for january 2014 and for children covered by medicaid or chip through federal fiscal year 2019 states with or projecting a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the moe provision if states are successful in obtaining moe waivers and allow certain medicaid programs to expire we could experience reduced medicaid enrollment which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

under the us supreme court’s june 2012 decision state participation in the health reform legislation’s medicaid expansion is voluntary several states have indicated they may not expand their medicaid programs based on concerns over costs when expanded federal funding pares down starting in 2017 the extent to which states expand their medicaid programs or discontinue current expansion programs could adversely impact our medicaid enrollment levels which could in turn materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

several of the provisions in the health reform legislation will likely increase our medical cost trends examples of these provisions are the excise tax on medical devices annual fees on prescription drug manufacturers enhanced coverage requirements including essential health benefit requirements and phasedin closing of the coverage gap for medicare part d participants the prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions and the implementation of adjusted community rating requirements the annual insurance industry assessment 8 billion to be levied on the insurance industry in 2014 increasing to 143 billion by 2018 with increasing annual amounts thereafter which is not deductible for income tax purposes and the temporary reinsurer’s fee 25 billion to be levied on all commercial lines of business including insured and selffunded arrangements over a threeyear period starting in 2014 will increase our operating costs premium increases or benefit reductions will be necessary to offset the impact these and other provisions will have on our medical and operating costs these premium increases are often subject to state regulatory approval and the federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by commercial health plans and providing funding to assist in those statelevel reviews we have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states including california and new york in addition as required under the health reform legislation hhs established a federal premium rate review process which became effective in september 2011 and generally applies to proposed rate increases equal to or exceeding 10 the regulations further require commercial health plans in the individual and small group markets to provide to the states and hhs extensive information supporting rate increases if we are not able to secure approval for adequate premium increases to offset increases in our cost structure or if consumers forego coverage as a result of such premium increases our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in addition plans deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the statebased exchanges that become active under the health reform legislation in 2014 under the regulations the hhs rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets 

we also expect that implementation of the health reform legislation will increase the demand for products and capabilities offered by our optum businesses we have made and will continue to make strategic decisions and investments based in part on these assumptions and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under the health reform legislation than we expect or we are unable to attract these new individuals to our unitedhealthcare offerings or if the demand for our optum businesses does not increase 

future regulatory or legislative action could further impact the implementation of health reform legislation for example congress may attempt to amend or withhold the funding necessary to implement the health reform legislation in addition a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the health reform legislation new federal or state laws and regulations could force us to materially change how we do business and any amendment withholding of funding extended delays in the issuance of necessary federal and state implementing regulations or guidance or other uncertainty regarding the health reform legislation could materially and adversely impact our ability to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the legislation or cause us to incur additional costs of compliance or reverse some of the changes we have already implemented in addition our market share our results of operations our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by legislative and regulatory changes 

for additional information regarding the health reform legislation see item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview  regulatory trends and uncertainties” 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care coverage programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs chip and our tricare west contract with the dod and receive substantial revenues from these programs we also provide services to payers through our optum businesses these programs generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities for example cms has in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks are expected in the next few years although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis terminated benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these benchmark reductions there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the medicare advantage program a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and we will not have additional members autoassigned to us for example we lost approximately 470000 of our autoenrolled lowincome subsidy members in 2012 because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or other programs on which we bid or our competitors submit bids at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks for example as part of the health reform legislation cms has developed a system entitling plans that meet certain quality ratings at the local plan level to various quality bonus payments in addition under the health reform legislation congress authorized cms and the states to implement mme managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs including medicare medicaid and the mme demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries or our inability to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjusting monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers as well as for medicare part d plans risksharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and certain of our local plans have been audited such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by cms in february 2012 cms published a final radv audit and payment adjustment methodology the methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited beginning with 2011 payments using an extrapolation of the “error rate” identified in audit samples and for medicare advantage plans after considering a feeforservice ffs “error rate” adjuster that will be used in determining the payment 

adjustment depending on the plans selected for audit if any and the error rate found in those audits if any potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we have been and may in the future become involved in various governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments state attorneys general the oig the office of personnel management the office of civil rights the ftc us congressional committees the doj us attorneys the sec the cvm the irs the srf the dol the fdic and other governmental authorities certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review including for among other things compliance with coding and other requirements under the medicare riskadjustment model such investigations audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that among other things we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false claims to the government governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could expand to subjects beyond those targeted by the original investigation audit review assessment or private action and could lead to government actions which could result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” for a discussion of certain of these matters 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf or if we fail to address emerging security threats or detect and prevent privacy and security incidents our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change further many of our businesses are subject to the payment card industry data security standards pci dss which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities see item 1 “business  government regulation” for additional information hipaa also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we still have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices 

our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents security attacks and breaches acts of vandalism or theft computer viruses coordinated attacks by activist entities emerging cybersecurity risks misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events emerging and advanced security threats including coordinated attacks require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations 

compliance with new privacy and security laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain our ability to manage our business model for example final hhs regulations released in january 2013 implementing the arra amendments to hipaa may further restrict our ability to collect disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose additional compliance requirements on our business in addition hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities although we are not aware of hhs plans to audit any of our covered entities an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business including mandatory disclosure to the media significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards among other consequences any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pbm industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products  

we provide pbm services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers optumrx also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average 

wholesale prices see item 1 “business  government regulation” for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our pbm businesses 

our pbm businesses would also be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to timely process and dispense prescriptions and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pbm businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pbm businesses even where our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pbm businesses in connection with services for which our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions 

unitedhealthcare employer  individual recently began to transition pharmacy benefit management for approximately 12 million of its commercial members including pharmacy claims adjudication and customer service from express scripts’ subsidiary medco health solutions inc to optumrx if our customers are not satisfied with our pharmacy benefit management services as a result of this transition unitedhealthcare employer  individual could face loss of business which could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows   could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate we compete with other companies on the basis of many factors including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives location and choice of health care providers quality of customer service comprehensiveness of coverage offered reputation for quality care financial stability and diversity of product offerings for our unitedhealthcare businesses competitors include aetna inc cigna corporation coventry health care inc health net inc humana inc kaiser permanente wellpoint inc numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and with respect to our brazilian operations several established competitors in brazil and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas for our optumrx businesses competitors include cvs caremark corporation express scripts inc and catamaran corporation our optumhealth and optuminsight reportable segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses 

in particular markets competitors may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements better existing business relationships or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate both among our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or maintain or increase profitability if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for services our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract for these services at competitive prices failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital 

organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition accountable care organizations acos practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way that these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which may impact our relationships with these providers or affect the way that we price our products and estimate our costs and may require us to incur costs to change our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us for example we are involved in litigation with outofnetwork providers as described in more detail in “litigation matters” in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” 

the success of certain optum businesses particularly collaborative care depends on maintaining satisfactory physician relationships the primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and hmo competitors of unitedhealthcare if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or hmo companies or to adequately price their contracts with these third party payers our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows   

because of the nature of our business we are routinely subject to various litigation actions which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties andor monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other things the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort including claims related to the delivery of health care services such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us have contractual relationships with us or serve as providers to our managed care networks contract and labor disputes tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers in addition we periodically acquire businesses or commence operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess 

liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters however it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

a description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in select markets and businesses 

any failure by us to successfully manage our strategic alliances or complete manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions for example we have a strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance to aarp members and other aarpbranded products and services to both aarp members and nonmembers if we fail to meet the needs of aarp and its members including by developing additional products and services pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliance with the aarp could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and results of operations further if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows for acquisitions success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

as we continue to expand our business outside the united states acquired foreign businesses such as amil will present challenges that are different from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including adapting to new markets business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments that are materially different from what we have experienced in our us operations for more information on the amil acquisition see note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated benefits or synergies from the acquired businesses these challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into us dollars or other currencies if we are unable to successfully manage our foreign acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debtplusequity ratio and the future costs of or revenues and cash flows from our international operations and any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective 

sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products are sold in part through independent producers and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business we typically do not have longterm contracts with our producers and consultants who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend andor market health care products and services of our competitors as a result we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract or retain independent producers and consultants or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to them regarding our product portfolio or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 

because producer commissions are included as administrative expenses under the medical loss ratio requirements of the health reform legislation these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other administrative costs our 

relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commissions 

in addition there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling these companies’ products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services for example high unemployment rates have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans and our nonemployer individual plans unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated andor received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hmos hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optum’s financial results 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2012 relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income and a prolonged low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal andor interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our net investment income and we may be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and shareholders’ equity 

we also allocate a small proportion of our portfolio to equity investments which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments general economic conditions stock market conditions and many other factors beyond our control can materially and adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations shareholders’ equity and debt ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

goodwill and other intangible assets were 360 billion  as of december 31 2012 representing 44  of our total consolidated assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary for example the manner in or the extent to which the health reform legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other 

intangible assets in our business similarly the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could in turn adversely impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with our debt covenants 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to adequately price our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we periodically consolidate integrate upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards emerging cybersecurity risks and threats and changing customer patterns if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting our systems against cybersecurity risks and threats enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products and these products may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition uncertain and rapidly evolving us federal and state nonus and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that 

exceed specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements thereto readers are cautioned that the statements estimates projections or outlook contained in this report including discussions regarding financial prospects economic conditions trends and uncertainties contained in this item 7 may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements a description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this item 7 and in item 1a “risk factors” 

executive overview 

general 

unitedhealth group is a diversified health and wellbeing company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making health care work better we offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms unitedhealthcare which provides health care coverage and benefits services and optum which provides information and technologyenabled health services further information on our business is included in item 1 “business” and additional information on the our segments can be found in this item 7 and in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements” 

revenues 

our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from riskbased health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a oneyear period and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs we also generate revenues from feebased services performed for customers that selfinsure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependants for both riskbased and feebased health care benefit arrangements we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services transaction processing health care professional services and access to contracted networks of physicians hospitals and other health care professionals we also generate service revenues from our optum businesses relating to care management consumer engagement and support distribution of benefits and services health financial services operational services and support health care information technology and pharmacy services product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business we derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold or otherthantemporarily impaired 

pricing trends  we seek to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends while balancing growth margins competitive dynamics cost increases for the industry fees and tax provisions of health reform legislation and premium rebates at the local market level we endeavor to sustain a commercial medical care ratio in a stable range for an equivalent mix of business changes in business mix and health reform legislation may impact our premiums medical costs and medical care ratio further we continue to expect premium rates to be under pressure through continued market competition in commercial products and government payment rates aggregating unitedhealthcare’s businesses we expect the medical care ratio to rise over time as we continue to grow in the senior and public markets and participate in the health benefit exchange market in 2014 

in the commercial market segment we expect pricing to continue to be highly competitive in 2013 we plan to hold to our pricing disciplines and considering the competitive environment and persistently weak employment and new business formation rates we expect continued pressure on our commercial riskbased product membership in 2013 additionally selfinsured membership as a percent of total commercial membership is expected to continue to increase at a modest pace in 2013 and beyond due in part to the emerging popularity of midsize employers moving to selffunded arrangements 

in government programs we are seeing continuing rate pressures and rate changes for some medicaid programs are slightly negative unlike in prior years recent medicaid reductions have generally not been mitigated by corresponding benefit reductions or care provider fee schedule reductions by the state sponsor we continue to take a prudent marketsustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing medicaid contracts medicare funding is similarly pressured see further discussion below in “regulatory trends and uncertainties” we expect these factors to result in pressure on gross margin percentages for our medicare and medicaid programs in 2013 

in 2013 unitedhealthcare created a new affordable “basic plan” for medicare part d consumers and reclassified its large 4 million member medicare part d plan to an “enhanced plan” status with cms the change to enhanced plan status changes the seasonal pattern of earnings to later in the year with no material impact expected on full year profitability 

operating costs 

medical costs  medical costs represent the costs of our obligations for claims andor benefits of our riskbased insurance arrangements our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patientsconsumers health professionals hospitals pharmaceuticaltechnology manufacturers and other key stakeholders 

medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims and our estimates for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 

our medical care ratio calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues reflects the combination of pricing rebates benefit designs consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts 

medical cost trends in 2012 we managed our commercial medical cost trend to a level under 55 percent in 2013 we expect a slight increase in trend from 2012 albeit with relatively consistent unit cost and utilization trends compared to 2012 we expect our total trend will be driven primarily by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers as they try to compensate for soft utilization trends and crosssubsidization pressure due to their government reimbursement levels 

underlying utilization trends declined significantly in 2010 and increased modestly in 2011 and 2012 use of outpatient services has been the primary driver of utilization trend increase with inpatient utilization declining we also experienced an increase in prescription drug costs in 2012 and expect that trend to continue due to unit cost pressure and a trend towards expensive new specialty drugs as we move into 2013 we believe current utilization trends are slightly below what we believe to be normal utilization levels the weak economic environment combined with our medical cost management has had a favorable impact on utilization trends we believe our alignment of progressive benefit designs consumer engagement clinical management payforperformance reimbursement programs for care providers and network resources is favorably controlling medical and pharmacy costs enhancing affordability and quality for our customers and members and helping to drive strong market response and growth 

operating costs  operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits agent and broker commissions premium taxes and assessments professional fees advertising and occupancy costs we seek to improve our operating cost ratio calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues for an equivalent mix of business however changes in business mix such as increases in the size of our health services businesses or an increase in the delivery of medical services on an integrated basis may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio 

other business trends 

our businesses participate in the us brazilian and certain other health economies in the us health care spending comprises approximately 18 of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes including in the us enacted health care reforms which could also impact our results of operations 

delivery system and payment modernization the market is changing based on demographic shifts new regulations political forces and both payer and patient expectations these factors are creating market pressures to change from feeforservice models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer integrated care across care providers and payforperformance payment structures health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve the overall care for people improve the health of a population and reduce the cost of care the focus on delivery system modernization and payment reform is critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme we have seen increased participation in incentivebased payment models such as pay for performance shared savings bundledepisode payment and patientcentered medical home models pcmhs we also have seen continued development and deployment of riskbased accountable care models designed to modernize local delivery systems by better coordinating care reducing the fragmentation of treatments between multiple care providers in the current system limiting unnecessary hospital admissions and readmissions focusing on preventive care breaking down reimbursement and treatment “silos” and improving quality and outcomes 

this trend is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems providing growth opportunities for our optum business platform 

government reliance on private sector the government as a benefit sponsor has been increasingly relying on private sector solutions we expect this trend to continue as we believe the private sector provides a more flexible better managed higher quality health care experience than do traditional passive indemnity programs typically used in governmental benefit programs 

states are struggling to balance unprecedented budget pressures with increases in their medicaid expenditures at the same time many are expanding their interest in managed care with particular emphasis on consumers who have complex and expensive health care needs more and more medicaid managed care is being viewed as an effective method to improve quality and manage costs additionally there are more than nine million individuals eligible for both medicare and medicaid dually eligible beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than a typical medicare or medicaid beneficiary while these individuals’ health needs are more complex and more costly they have historically been in unmanaged environments this provides unitedhealthcare an opportunity to integrate medicare and medicaid financing to fund efforts to optimize the health status of this frail population through close coordination of care as of december 31 2012 unitedhealthcare served more than 250000 members in legacy dually eligible programs through medicare advantage and snps in 2013 unitedhealthcare community  state will help implement ohio’s mme program one of the first in the country under the new cms design 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the health reform legislation and other regulatory items for additional information regarding the health reform legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties see item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 1a “risk factors” 

commercial rate increase review  the health reform legislation requires hhs to maintain an annual review of “unreasonable” increases in premium rates for commercial health plans hhs established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10 and clarified that hhs review will not supersede existing state review and approval procedures premium rate review legislation ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states as of the date of this report 

the competitive forces common in our markets do not support unjustifiable rate increases we have experienced and expect to continue to experience a tight competitive commercial pricing environment further our rates and rate filings are developed using methods consistent with the standards of actuarial practices we anticipate requesting rate increases above 10 in a number of markets due to the combination of medical cost trends and the incremental costs of health care reform we have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states including california and new york depending on the level of scrutiny by the states there is a broad range of potential business impacts for example it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends leading to the risk of operating margin compression in the commercial health benefits business 

medicare advantage rates and minimum loss ratios  medicare advantage pricing benchmarks have been cut over the last several years and additional cuts were implemented in 2012 with changes to continue to be phased in over the next one to five years benchmarks will ultimately range from 95 of medicare feeforservice rates in high cost areas to 115 in low cost areas depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county additionally congress passed the budget control act of 2011 which as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 would trigger automatic acrosstheboard budget cuts sequestration including a reduction in outlays for medicare starting in march 2013 absent further congressional action further beginning in 2014 medicare advantage plans will be required to have a minimum medical loss ratio of 85 cms has not yet issued guidance as to how this requirement will be calculated for medicare advantage plans 

a significant portion of our network contracts are tied to medicare reimbursement levels however future medicare advantage rates may be outpaced by underlying medical cost trends placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs there are a number of annual adjustments we can and are making to our operations which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions for example we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management adjust members’ benefits and decide on a countybycounty basis in which geographies to participate additionally achieving high quality scores from cms for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions the expanded stars bonus program is set to expire in 2014 in 2015 quality bonus payments will only be paid to 4 and 5 star plans per ppaca compared to current bonuses that are available to certain qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher approximately 60 and 10 of our current medicare advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 35 stars or higher and 4 stars or 

higher respectively for the 2014 payment year based on scoring released by cms in october 2012 updated scores to be released in october 2013 will determine what portion of our medicare advantage membership will reside in a 4 star or 5 star plan and qualify for quality bonus payments in 2015 although we are dedicating substantial resources to improving our quality scores and star ratings if we are unable to significantly increase the level of membership in plans with a rating of 4 stars or higher for the 2015 payment year our 2015 results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due in part to the increasing number of people eligible for medicare in coming years compared to 2011 our 2012 medicare advantage membership has increased by 400000  consumers or 18  including acquisitions longer term market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of medicare advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our medicare supplement and medicare part d insurance offerings 

industry fees and taxes  the health reform legislation includes an annual nondeductible insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for riskbased products beginning january 1 2014 the amount of the annual tax is 8 billion in 2014 113 billion in 2015 and 2016 139 billion in 2017 and 143 billion in 2018 for 2019 and beyond the amount will be equal to the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year the annual tax will be allocated based on the ratio of an entity’s net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance industry’s net premiums written for any us health riskbased products during the preceding calendar year subject to certain exceptions this tax will first be paid and expensed in 2014 however because our policies are annual we have included the tax and other health reform legislation cost factors in our 2013 rate filings relating to 2014 rate periods and any related premium increases for 2013 policies that have coverage into 2014 will increase the amount of premium recognized in 2013 our effective income tax rate will increase significantly in 2014 as a result of the nondeductibility of these taxes 

with the introduction of state health insurance exchanges in 2014 the health reform legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets these programs are a transitional reinsurance program a temporary risk corridors program and a permanent risk adjustment program the transitional reinsurance program is a temporary program which will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and selffunded arrangements 25 billion over a threeyear period beginning in 2014 of which 20 billion subject to increases based on state decisions will fund the state reinsurance pools and 5 billion funds the us treasury the terms of the specific reinsurance programs to be used in each state are not yet known 

it is our intention to pass these taxes and fees on to customers through increases in rates andor decreases in benefits subject to regulatory approval 

statebased exchanges and coverage expansion  effective in 2014 statebased exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers with enrollment processes scheduled to commence in october of 2013 we expect to selectively respond and participate in exchanges as they are introduced to the market our level of participation in statebased exchanges will be driven by how we assess each local market’s current and future prospects including how the exchange and its rules are set up statebystate and our market position relative to others in the market our participation will likely evolve and change over time as the exchange markets mature exchanges will create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market its pace and its impact on our established membership for example certain small employers may no longer offer health benefits to their employees and larger employers may elect to convert their benefit plans from riskbased to selffunded programs 

the health reform legislation also provides for expanded medicaid coverage effective in january 2014 these measures remain subject to implementation at the state level 

individual  small group market reforms  the health reform legislation includes several provisions that will take effect on january 1 2014 and are expected to alter the individual and small group marketplace although hhs issued proposed regulations in late 2012 these regulations are not yet final key provisions include 1 adjusted community rating requirements which will change how individual and small group plans are rated in many states and are expected to result in significant adjustments in some policyholders’ rates during the transition period 2 essential health benefit requirements which will result in benefit changes for many individual and small group policyholders and will also impact rates and 3 actuarial value requirements which will significantly impact benefit designs eg member cost sharing requirements and could also significantly impact rates for some policyholders

 2012 results of operations compared to 2011 results 

c onsolidated financial results 

revenues 

revenue increases in 2012  were driven by growth in the number of individuals served and premium rate increases related to underlying medical cost trends in our unitedhealthcare businesses and growth in our optum health service and technology offerings 

medical costs 

medical costs increased in 2012  due to riskbased membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses unit cost inflation across all businesses and continued moderate increases in health system use partially offset by an increase in favorable medical reserve development unit cost increases represented the primary driver of our medical cost trend with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals 

operating costs 

the increases in our operating costs for 2012  were due to business growth including increases in revenues from unitedhealthcare feebased benefits and optum services which carry comparatively higher operating costs as well as investments in the optumrx pharmacy management services and unitedhealthcare military  veterans businesses 

income tax rate 

the increase in our effective income tax rate for 2012  was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2011 which lowered the 2011  effective income tax rate 

reportable segments 

we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms unitedhealthcare and optum 

 see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” and item 1 “business” for a description of how each of our reportable segments derives its revenues 

transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to unitedhealthcare customers by optumrx certain product offerings and care management and integrated care delivery services sold to unitedhealthcare by optumhealth and health information and technology solutions consulting and other services sold to unitedhealthcare by optuminsight these transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation

nm not meaningful 

 commercial riskbased membership decreased in 2012 due to a competitive market environment conversions to feebased products by large public sector clients that we retained and other decreases in the public sector in feebased commercial products the increase was due to a number of new business awards and strong customer retention medicare advantage increased due to strengthened execution in product design marketing and local engagement which drove sales growth combined with the addition of 185000 medicare advantage members from 2012 acquisitions medicaid growth was due to a combination of winning new state accounts and growth within existing state customers partially offset by a fourth quarter market withdrawal from one product in a specific region affecting 175000 beneficiaries medicare supplement growth was due to strong retention and new sales in our medicare part d standalone business membership decreased primarily as a result of the first quarter 2012 loss of approximately 470000 autoassigned lowincome subsidy medicare part d beneficiaries due to pricing benchmarks for the governmentsubsidized low income medicare part d market coming in below our bids in a number of regions international represents commercial membership in brazil added as a result of the amil acquisition in 2012 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue growth in 2012  was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served commercial premium rate increases related to expected increases in underlying medical cost trends and the impact of lower premium rebates 

unitedhealthcare’s earnings from operations for 2012  increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the factors that increased revenues combined with an improvement in the medical care ratio driven by effective management of medical costs and increased favorable medical reserve development the favorable development for 2012  was driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels and increased efficiency in claims handling and processing 

in march 2012 unitedhealthcare military  veterans was awarded the tricare west region managed care support contract the contract for health care operations includes a transition period and five oneyear renewals at the government’s option the first year of operations is anticipated to begin april 1 2013 the base administrative services contract is expected to generate a total of 14 billion in revenues over the five years 

optum  total revenues increased in 2012  due to business growth and 2011 acquisitions at optumhealth partially offset by a reduction in pharmacy service revenues related to reduced levels of unitedhealthcare part d prescription drug membership and related prescription volumes 

optum’s earnings from operations and operating margin for 2012  increased compared to 2011 due to improvements in operating cost structure stemming from advances in business simplification integration and overall efficiency and revenue growth in higher margin products 

the results by segment were as follows 

optumhealth 

revenue increases at optumhealth for 2012  were primarily due to market expansion including growth related to 2011 acquisitions in integrated care delivery and strong overall business growth 

earnings from operations for 2012  and operating margins increased compared to 2011 primarily due to gains in operating efficiency and cost management as well as increases in earnings from integrated care operations 

optuminsight 

revenues at optuminsight for 2012  increased primarily due to the impact of growth in compliance services for care providers and payment integrity offerings for commercial payers which was partially offset by the june 2011 divestiture of the clinical trials services business 

the increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012  reflect an improved mix of services and advances in operating efficiency and cost management 

optumrx 

the decreases in optumrx revenues in 2012  were due to the reduction in unitedhealthcare medicare part d plan participants intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were 156 billion  for 2012  and 167 billion  for 2011  

optumrx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012  decreased primarily due to decreased prescription volume in the medicare part d business and investments to support growth initiatives which were partially offset by earnings contributions from specialty pharmacy growth and greater use of generic medications 

over the course of 2013 we will consolidate and manage our commercial pharmacy benefit programs from express scripts’ subsidiary medco health solutions inc as a result of this transition optumrx expects to add approximately12 million members throughout 2013 

2011 results of operations compared to 2010 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

the increases in revenues for 2011  were driven by strong organic growth in the number of individuals served in our unitedhealthcare businesses commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends and revenue growth across all optum businesses 

medical costs 

medical costs for 2011  increased due to riskbased membership growth in our commercial and public and senior markets businesses and continued increases in the cost per service paid for health system use and a modest increase in health system utilization mainly in outpatient and physician office settings 

for each period our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period are included in total medical costs reported for the current period for 2011  and 2010  there was 720 million  and 800 million  respectively of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years the favorable development in both periods was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness which resulted in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels the favorable development in 2010 also benefited from a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers and favorable resolution of certain statebased assessments 

operating costs 

the increase in our operating costs for 2011  was due to business growth including an increased mix of optum and unitedhealthcare feebased and service revenues which have higher operating costs and increased spending related to reform readiness and compliance these factors were partially offset by overall operating cost management and the increase in 2010 operating costs due to the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3branded clinical trial service businesses 

income tax rate 

the effective income tax rate for 2011  decreased compared to the prior year due to favorable resolution of various historical tax matters in the current year as well as a higher effective income tax rate in 2010 due to the cumulative implementation of certain changes under the health reform legislation 

reportable segments 

unitedhealthcare 

unitedhealthcare’s revenue growth for 2011  was due to growth in the number of individuals served across our businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting expected underlying medical cost trends 

unitedhealthcare’s earnings from operations for 2011  increased compared to the prior year as revenue growth and improvements in the operating cost ratio more than offset increased compliance costs and an increase to the medical care ratio which was primarily due to the initiation of premium rebate obligations in 2011 and lower favorable reserve development levels 

optum  total revenue for these businesses increased in 2011 due to business growth and acquisitions at optumhealth and optuminsight and growth in customers served through pharmaceutical benefit management programs at optumrx 

optum’s operating margin for 2011  was down compared to 2010 the decrease was due to changes in business mix within optum’s businesses and realignment of certain internal business arrangements 

the results by segment were as follows 

optumhealth 

increased revenues at optumhealth for 2011  were primarily due to expansions in service offerings through acquisitions in clinical services as well as growth in consumer and population health management offerings 

earnings from operations for 2011  and operating margin decreased compared to 2010 the decreases reflect the impact from internal business and service arrangement realignments and the mix effect of growth and expansion in newer businesses such as clinical services 

optuminsight 

increased revenues at optuminsight for 2011  were due to the impact of organic growth and the fullyear impact of 2010 acquisitions which were partially offset by the divestiture of the clinical trials services business in june 2011 

the increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011  reflect an increased mix of higher margin services in 2011 as well as the effect on 2010 earnings from operations and operating margin of the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3branded clinical trial service businesses 

optumrx 

the increase in optumrx revenues for 2011  was due to increased prescription volumes primarily due to growth in customers served through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement business and a favorable mix of higher revenue specialty drug prescriptions intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were 167 billion  and 144 billion  for 2011  and 2010  respectively 

optumrx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011  decreased as the mix of lower margin specialty pharmaceuticals and medicaid business and investments to support growth initiatives including the insourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs more than offset the earnings contribution from higher revenues and greater use of generic medications 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each jurisdiction and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies in the united states most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the naic except in the case of extraordinary dividends these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus these dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval if the dividend together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus the entire dividend is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval in 2012 based on the 2011 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid by our us regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was 46 billion  

in 2012  our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 49 billion  including 12 billion  of extraordinary dividends in 2011  our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 45 billion  including 11 billion  of extraordinary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or drawings under our committed credit facility further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends andor repurchases of our common stock depending on market conditions 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash 



2012 cash flows compared to 2011 cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities for 2012  increased 187 million  or 3  from 2011 due to increased net income and related tax accruals which were partially offset by the payment in 2012 of 2011 premium rebate obligations as 2012 was the first year rebate payments were made under the health reform legislation 

cash flows used for investing activities increased 45 billion  or 107  primarily due to increased investments in acquisitions in 2012 see note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” for further information on 2012 acquisitions 

cash flows from financing activities increased 30 billion  primarily due to increases in longterm debt commercial paper and common stock issuances partially offset by increases in cash paid for customer funds related to part d and increased shareholder dividend payments the increases in longterm debt commercial paper and common stock issuances were primarily related to the amil acquisition 

2011 cash flows compared to 2010 cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased 695 million  or 11  from 2010 the increase was primarily driven by growth in net earnings and changes in various working capital accounts which were partially offset by a reduction in unearned revenues due to the early receipt of certain 2011 state medicaid premium payments in 2010 which increased 2010 cash from operating activities 

cash flows used for investing activities decreased 12 billion  or 22  primarily due to relatively lower investments in acquisitions in 2011 and a decrease in net purchases of investments 

cash flows used for financing activities increased 879 million  or 55  primarily due to increased share repurchases and cash dividends in 2011 partially offset by an increase in net borrowings 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2012  our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 283 billion  included 84 billion  of cash and cash equivalents of which 11 billion  was held by nonregulated entities 192 billion  of debt securities and 677 million  of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies especially those used in valuing our 241 million  of availableforsale level 3 securities those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments due to the subjective nature of these assumptions the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facilities reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” for further detail of our fair value measurements 

our cash equivalent and investment portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 21 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2012  included in the debt securities balance was 19 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers the weightedaverage credit rating of these securities with and without the guarantee was “aa” as of december 31 2012  we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor neither indirect through the guarantees nor direct through investment in the guarantor when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper  we maintain a commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through thirdparty brokerdealers the commercial paper program is supported by the bank credit facilities described below as of december 31 2012  we had 16 billion  of commercial paper outstanding at a weightedaverage annual interest rate of 03  

bank credit facilities   we have 30 billion  fiveyear and 10 billion 364day revolving bank credit facilities with 21  banks which mature in november 2017  and november 2013 respectively these facilities provide liquidity support for our 40 billion commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes there were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of december 31 2012  the interest rates on borrowings are variable depending on term and are calculated based on the libor plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings as of december 31 2012  the annual interest rates on these facilities had they been drawn would have ranged from 10  to 13  

our bank credit facilities contain various covenants including requiring us to maintain a debt to debtplusequity ratio of not more than 50 our debt to debtplusequity ratio calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ 

equity which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio was 350  as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of december 31 2012  

longterm debt  periodically we access capital markets and issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes for example to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases 

in connection with the amil acquisition we assumed variable rate debt denominated in brazilian reais amil’s functional currency the total brazilian real denominated longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2012 was 611 million  and had an aggregate weighted average interest rate of approximately 9 for more detail on the amil debt see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” 

in october 2012 we issued 25 billion  in senior unsecured notes which included 625 million  of 0850  fixedrate notes due october 2015  625 million  of 1400  fixedrate notes due october 2017  625 million  of 2750  fixedrate notes due february 2023  and 625 million  of 3950  fixedrate notes due october 2042  

in august 2012 we completed an exchange of 11 billion  of our zero coupon senior unsecured notes due november 2022 for 05 billion  additional issuance of our 2875  notes due in march 2022  01 billion  additional issuance of our 4375  notes due march 2042  and 01 billion  in cash the transaction was undertaken to increase financial flexibility and reduce interest expense 

in march 2012  we issued 10 billion  in senior unsecured notes the issuance included 600 million  of 2875  fixedrate notes due march 2022  and 400 million  of 4375  fixedrate notes due march 2042  

credit ratings  our credit ratings at december 31 2012  were as follows 



the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital we have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital 

share repurchase program under our board of directors’ authorization we maintain a share repurchase program repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs subject to certain board restrictions in june 2012  our board renewed and expanded our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million  shares of our common stock as of december 31 2012  we had board authorization to purchase up to an additional 85 million shares of our common stock for details of our 2012 share repurchases see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” 

dividends in june 2012  our board of directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of 085  per share paid quarterly since may 2011  we had paid an annual dividend of 065  per share paid quarterly declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change for details of our dividend payments see note 10 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” 

amil tender offer during the fourth quarter of 2012 we purchased approximately 65 of the outstanding shares of amil for 35 billion we expect to acquire an additional 25 ownership interest during the first half of 2013 through a tender offer for amil’s publicly traded shares the tender offer price will be at the same price paid to amil’s controlling shareholders adjusted for statutory interest under brazilian law from the date of payment to the controlling shareholders to the date of payment to the tendering minority shareholders 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2012  under our various contractual obligations and commitments 



 we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations this includes internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2012 we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as that phrase is defined by sec rules applicable to this report which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

recently issued accounting standards 

we have determined that there have been no recently issued but not yet adopted accounting standards that will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent 

periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs payable 

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim processing backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption health care professional contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics the introduction of new technologies benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service as of december 31 2012 our days outstanding in medical payables was 49 days 

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2012  2011  and 2010  included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of 860 million  720 million  and 800 million  respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36month period a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation for months prior to the most recent three months we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicatedtodate to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months for the most recent three months we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors this approach is consistently applied from period to period 

completion factors  completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods generally periods prior to the most recent three months the completion factor includes judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserves may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2012  

  



medical cost pmpm trend factors  medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and by reviewing a 

broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as grossdomestic product growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes and epidemics 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31 2012  

  



the analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2012  developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2012  however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2012  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2012  net earnings would have increased or decreased by 62 million 

revenues 

revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services as recorded in our records 

effective in 2011 us commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products as calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts each period we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set eg by state group size and licensed subsidiary the most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix the estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience 

our medicare advantage and part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under cms’ risk adjustment payment methodology the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier we and health care providers collect capture and submit available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines cms uses submitted diagnosis codes demographic information and special statuses to determine the risk score for most medicare advantage beneficiaries cms also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations the actual amount of cms’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and accordingly our profitability risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the government including audit by regulators see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” for additional information regarding these audits 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

to determine whether goodwill is impaired we perform a multistep impairment test first we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values if the qualitative analysis is not conclusive or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates for each reporting unit comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

forecasts and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategy key assumptions used in these forecasts include 

 although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units due to the longterm nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections that uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in item 1 “business  government regulation” for additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and how other factors could affect our business and the related longterm forecasts see item 1a “risk factors” in part i and “regulatory trends and uncertainties” above 

discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts this risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples beyond our selection of the most appropriate riskfree rates and equity risk premiums our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unitspecific factors such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and companyspecific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty 

the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future 

we elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of january 1 2013 all of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values thus we concluded that there was no need for any impairment of our goodwill balances as of december 31 2012  

intangible assets  separatelyidentifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance eg membership lists customer contracts trademarks and technology our intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives while indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis both finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment our most significant intangible assets are customerrelated intangibles which represent 77  of our total intangible asset balance of 47 billion  

customerrelated intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition the most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customerrelated assets include projected revenue and earnings growth retention rate perpetuity growth rate and discount rate these initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results eg customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested 

our finitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including changes in the use of the assets changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value experienced or expected operating cashflow deterioration or losses adverse changes in customer populations adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors following the identification of any potential impairment indicators we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finitelived intangible asset or asset group using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets if it is determined that an impairment exists the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist to determine if an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value no impairment exists and no further testing is performed if we conclude otherwise we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 

intangible assets were not impaired in 2012  

investments 

as of december 31 2012  we had investments with a carrying value of 21 billion  primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses net of income tax effects as a separate component in shareholders’ equity we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2012  our investments had gross unrealized gains of 825 million  and gross unrealized losses of 9 million  

for debt securities if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security we recognize the entire impairment in earnings if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss which is recognized in earnings and all other causes which are recognized in other comprehensive income 

for equity securities we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period if we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term we recognize the impairment in our income statement 

the most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the otherthantemporary impairment assessment 

fair values fair values of availableforsale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices where available we obtain one price for each security primarily from a thirdparty pricing service pricing service which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value the pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information for securities not actively traded the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include but are not limited to benchmark yields credit spreads default rates and prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes as we are responsible for the determination of fair value we perform quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value specifically we compare 

 based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service 

otherthantemporary impairment assessment   individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and liquidity given the nature of our portfolio primarily investment grade securities historical impairments were largely market related eg interest rate fluctuations etc as opposed to credit related we do not expect that trend to change in the near term our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security however our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change 

we believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value the unrealized losses of 9 million and 32 million at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities mortgagebacked securities and corporate debt obligations substantially all of investmentgrade quality securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy total otherthantemporary impairments during 2012  2011  and 2010  were 6 million  12 million  and 23 million  respectively our cash equivalent and investment portfolio had a weightedaverage duration of 21 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2012  we have minimal securities collateralized by subprime or alta securities and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default 

the judgments and estimates related to fair value and otherthantemporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including circumstances may change over time industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold our assessment of the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including current facts and circumstances changing or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop 

as discussed further in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” a 1 increase in market interest rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by 656 million 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence both positive and negative for which it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such 

examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems 

the significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year a hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on our 2012 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by 86 million 

contingent liabilities 

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel if appropriate and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage if any for such matters 

estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving us are inherently difficult to predict particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines penalties or punitive damages present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies are in the early stages of the proceedings or could result in a change in business practices accordingly in many cases we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred similarly the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment 

given this inherent uncertainty it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions we evaluate our related disclosures each reporting period see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” for discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is included in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements” 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base as of december 31 2012  we had an aggregate 19 billion  reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005 we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery as of december 31 2012 the reinsurer was rated by am best as “a” as of december 31 2012  there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt b foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the brazilian real and c changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 

as of december 31 2012  we had 94 billion  of cash cash equivalents and investments on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also 67 billion  of our debt and deposit liabilities as of december 31 2012  were at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2012  191 billion  of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 136 billion of our debt was nonswapped fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities as well as endeavoring to match our floatingrate assets and liabilities over time either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 or 2 as of december 31 2012  and 2011  on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions except percentages 



nm  not meaningful 

 with the amil acquisition we have an exposure to changes in the value of the brazilian real to the us dollar in translation of amil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period and amil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period the gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars are included in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income 

an appreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in brazilian real for example as of december 31 2012 a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against the brazilian real would cause a reduction in net assets of 510 million we manage exposure to foreign currency risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies we funded certain cash needs of amil through intercompany notes at december 31 2012 we had currency swaps with a total notional amount of 256 million hedging the us dollar to the brazilian real to provide a cash flow hedge on the principal amount of the intercompany notes to amil 

as of december 31 2012  we had 677 million  of investments in equity securities including employee savings plan related investments of 348 million  and venture capital funds a portion of which were invested in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will impact the value of our equity investments

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

in connection with the filing of this form 10k management evaluated under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2012  based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2012  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2012  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012   

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012  in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control  integrated f ramework management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting of amil participações sa and its subsidiaries amil such exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition we acquired a controlling interest in amil during october 2012 amil represented 10 of our consolidated total assets and 1 of our consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 based on our assessment and the coso criteria we believe that as of december 31 2012  the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012  as stated in the report of independent registered public accounting firm appearing under item 9a which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2012  

  

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and shareholders of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2012 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at amil participações sa and its subsidiaries amil which was acquired during october 2012 and whose financial statements collectively constitute approximately 10 of total assets and 1 of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at amil the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 based on the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 of the company and our reports dated february 6 2013  expressed as an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

government regulation 

most of our health and wellbeing services are regulated by federal and state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically in the first quarter of 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and a reconciliation measure the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we refer to together as the health reform legislation were signed into law the health reform legislation portions of which are summarized below alters the regulatory environment in which we operate in some cases to a significant degree federal and state governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system new laws regulations and rules or changes in the interpretation of existing laws regulations and rules as well as a result of changes in the political climate could adversely affect our business 

in the event we fail to comply with or we fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in applicable laws regulations and rules our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal and state laws and regulations 

health care reforms 

the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market as well as the medicaid and medicare programs chip and other aspects of the health care system certain provisions of the health reform legislation have already taken effect and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years the us department of health and human services hhs the us department of labor dol and the us treasury department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation remain pending 

certain aspects of the health reform legislation are also being challenged in federal court with the proponents of such 

challenges seeking to limit the scope of or have all or portions of the health reform legislation declared unconstitutional the united states supreme court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on certain aspects of these cases in march 2012 including the constitutionality of the individual mandate congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the health reform legislation or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether 

the following outlines certain provisions of the health reform legislation that have recently taken effect or are expected to take effect in the coming years assuming the legislation is implemented in its current form 

effective 2010  the health reform legislation mandated the expansion of dependent coverage to include adult children until age 26 eliminated certain annual and lifetime caps on the dollar value of certain essential health benefits eliminated preexisting condition limits for enrollees under age 19 prohibited certain policy rescissions prohibited plans and issuers from charging higher cost sharing copayments or coinsurance for emergency services that are obtained out of a plans network and included a requirement to provide coverage for preventive services without cost to members for nongrandfathered plans 

the health reform legislation also mandated certain changes to coverage determination and appeals processes including expanding the definition of “adverse benefit determination” to include rescissions extending external review rights of adverse benefit determinations to insured and selffunded plans and improving the clarity of and expanding the types of information in adverse benefit determination notices 

effective 2011  commercial fully insured health plans in the large employer group small employer group and individual markets with medical loss ratios below certain targets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for individuals as calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and regulations subject to state specific exceptions are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually rebate payments for 2011 will be made in mid 2012 a state can request a waiver of the individual market medical loss ratio for up to three years if the state petitions and provides to hhs certain supporting data and hhs determines that the requirement is disruptive to the market in that state by the end of 2011 17 states petitioned hhs for waivers of the mandated individual market medical loss ratio of which six were wholly or partially granted the health reform legislation also mandated consumer discounts of 50 on brand name prescription drugs and 7 on generic prescription drugs for part d plan participants in the coverage gap these consumer discounts will gradually increase over the next several years which will decrease consumer outofpocket drug spending within the coverage gap shifting a portion of these costs to the plan sponsor 

  in addition as required under the health reform legislation hhs established a federal premium rate review process which became effective in september 2011 and generally applies to proposed rate increases equal to or exceeding 10 with statespecific thresholds to be applicable commencing september 2012 the regulations further require commercial health plans to provide to the states and hhs extensive information supporting any rate increases subject to the new federal rate review process the regulations clarify that hhs review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes but plans deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the statebased exchanges that become active under the health reform legislation in 2014 under the regulations the hhs rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets 

effective 20112012  cms reduced or froze benchmarks which affect our medicare advantage reimbursements from cms between 2009 and 2011 and beginning in 2012 additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks will take effect benchmarks will ultimately range from 95 of medicare feeforservice rates in high cost areas to 115 in low cost areas with changes being phasedin over two to six years depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county in addition to other measures quality bonuses may partially offset these anticipated benchmark reductions as cms quality rating bonuses are phased in over three years beginning in 2012 

effective 2013  effective beginning in 2013 with respect to services performed after 2009 the health reform legislation limits the deductibility of executive compensation under section 162m of the internal revenue code for insurance providers if at least 25 of the insurance providers gross premium income from health business is derived from health insurance plans that meet the minimum creditable coverage requirements 

effective 20132014  the health reform legislation provides for an increase in medicaid feeforservice and managed care program reimbursements for primary care services provided by primary care doctors family medicine general internal medicine or pediatric medicine to 100 of the medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014 and provides 100 federal financing for the difference in rates based on rates applicable on july 1 2009 

effective 2014  a number of the provisions of the health reform legislation are scheduled to take effect in 2014 including an annual insurance industry assessment 8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter which is not deductible for income tax purposes expansion of medicaid eligibility for all individuals and families with incomes up to 133 of the federal poverty level states can early adopt the expansion without increased federal funding prior to 2014 with states receiving full federal matching in 2014 through 2016 all 

individual and group health plans must offer coverage on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis during annual open enrollment and special enrollment periods and cannot apply preexisting condition exclusions or health status rating adjustments elimination of annual limits on essential benefits coverage on certain plans establishment of statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers generally with up to 100 employees as well as certain chip eligibles introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values to increase comparability of competing products on the exchanges and establishment of minimum medical loss ratio of 85 for medicare advantage plans as calculated under rules that have not yet been issued 

the health reform legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments increase our medical and administrative costs expose us to an increased risk of liability including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our results of operations financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by such changes the health reform legislation may also create new or expand existing opportunities for business growth but due to its complexity the impact of the health reform legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known see also item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to the health reform legislation and related matters 

other federal laws and regulation 

we are subject to various levels of federal regulation for example when we contract with the federal government we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts cms regulates our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state medicare and medicaid businesses as well as certain aspects of our optum businesses our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us cms also has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care given to medicare beneficiaries see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and risk factors in this form 10k for a discussion of audits by cms 

our unitedhealthcare reporting segment through unitedhealthcare community  state also has medicaid and chip contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services and other aspects of these programs there are many regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs has become and will continue to become increasingly complex as a result of the health reform legislation in addition certain of optums businesses hold contracts with federal agencies including the us department of defense and we are subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of these contracts 

certain of unitedhealthcares and optums businesses such as unitedhealthcares eyeglass manufacturing activities and optums high clinical acuity workflow software hearing aid products and clinical research activities are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and the clinical research activities are also subject to laws and regulations outside of the united states that regulate clinical trials laws and regulations relating to consumer protection antifraud and abuse antikickbacks false claims prohibited referrals inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services antimoney laundering securities and antitrust also affect us 

hipaa glba and other privacy and security regulation the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended hipaa apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets including selffunded employee benefit plans hipaa requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers and certain eligible individuals it also requires guaranteed renewability for employers and individuals and limits exclusions based on preexisting conditions federal regulations related to hipaa include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information the hipaa privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us 

federal privacy and security requirements change frequently because of legislation regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation for example the us congress enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra which significantly amends and adds new privacy and security provisions to hipaa and imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information arra includes new contracting requirements for hipaa business associate agreements extends parts of hipaa privacy and security provisions to business associates adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to hhs and the federal trade commission ftc and in some cases to the local media strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for hipaa violations and in certain cases imposes criminal penalties for individuals including employees we are awaiting final 

regulations on many key aspects of the arra amendments to hipaa in the conduct of our business we may act depending on the circumstances as either a covered entity or a business associate federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws including the grammleachbliley act glba or state statutes implementing glba which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with hipaa glba and other privacyrelated regulations 

erisa the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employersponsored health benefit plans erisa is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the dol as well as the federal courts erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans particularly those that maintain selffunded plans regulations established by the dol provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by erisa additionally some states require licensure or registration of companies providing thirdparty claims administration services for health care plans 

fdic the fdic has federal regulatory authority over optumhealth bank and performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements in addition to such annual examinations the fdic performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable federal banking statutes regulations and agency guidelines in the event of unfavorable examination results the bank could be subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements governmental oversight and monetary penalties 

state laws and regulation 

health care regulation our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate those products and operations these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements with the amendment of the annual financial reporting model regulation by the national association of insurance commissioners naic to adopt elements substantially similar to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we expect that these states will continue to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of hmos and insurance companies certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum medical loss ratios with which health plans must comply in addition a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the health reform legislation we expect the states to continue to introduce and pass similar laws in 2012 and this will affect our operations and our financial results 

health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates these laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies 

in addition some of our business and related activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including ppo managed care organization mco utilization review ur or thirdparty administratorrelated regulations and licensure requirements these regulations differ from state to state and may contain network contracting product and rate and financial and reporting requirements there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services payment of claims adequacy of health care professional networks fraud prevention the protection of consumer health information pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services state health care antifraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members billing unnecessary medical services and improper marketing certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent broker and sales distributions laws and regulations our unitedhealthcare community  state and unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement businesses are subject to regulation by state medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our medicaid and chip beneficiaries and to our duallyeligible medicaid beneficiaries we also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of state government contracts 

guaranty fund assessments   under state guaranty fund laws certain insurance companies and hmos in some states including those issuing health longterm care life and accident insurance policies doing business in those states can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies 

that write the same line or lines of business assessments generally are based on a formula relating to premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of a matter involving penn treaty network american insurance company and its subsidiary penn treaty which have been placed in rehabilitation 

pharmacy regulation optumrxs mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located our mail order pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state our mail order pharmacies maintain certain medicare and state medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our pbm businesses 

privacy and security laws states have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the glba like hipaa glba allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection a number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices for example state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to protect credit card account data state and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information state consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers additionally different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and securityrelated regulations

corporate practice of medicine and feesplitting laws  certain of our businesses function as direct service providers to care delivery systems and as such are subject to additional laws and regulations some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit certain entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine additionally some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice feesplitting these prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory or may be a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation these laws regulations and interpretations have in certain states been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change 

consumer protection laws  certain businesses participate in directtoconsumer activities and are subject to emerging regulations applicable to online communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations

international regulation 

most of our business is conducted in the united states however some of our businesses and operations are international in nature and are consequently subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business these 

regulatory regimes encompass tax licensing tariffs intellectual property investment management control antifraud anticorruption and privacy and data protection regulations including requirements for crossborder data transfers that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction among other matters these international operations are also subject to united states laws that regulate activities of usbased businesses abroad

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections guidance or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words or phrases “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “plan” project” “should” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements 

the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address or update forwardlooking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications 

if we fail to effectively estimate price for and manage our medical costs the profitability of our riskbased products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

under our riskbased benefit product arrangements we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased benefits products comprise approximately 90 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of these products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs in this regard the health reform legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for certain health plans and authorized hhs to maintain an annual review process of “unreasonable” increases in premiums for commercial health plans in addition a number of states have enhanced or are proposing to enhance their premium review and approval processes see the risk factor below relating to health care reform for further discussion of these provisions 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period however medical cost inflation regulation and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use as a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if medical costs increased by 1 without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products our annual net earnings for 2011 would have been reduced by approximately 215 million excluding any offsetting impact from premium rebates 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove too low our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business activities are highly regulated new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business for example states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including those relating to ppos mcos utilization review and tparelated regulations and licensure requirements some of our businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws and regulations governing government contractors see item 1 “business  government regulation” for further information 

the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change for example in the first quarter of 2010 the health reform legislation was signed into law legislating broadbased changes to the us health care system see item 1 “business  government regulation” for a discussion of the health reform legislation the broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering regulations governing our business as well as future laws and rules and interpretation and enforcement of those laws and rules by governmental enforcement authorities could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions 

we must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions including integration of certain acquisitions for example premium rates for our health insurance andor managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and a number of states have enhanced or are proposing to enhance their rate review processes delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations financial position and cash flows 

under state guaranty fund laws certain insurance companies and hmos in some states including those issuing health which includes longterm care life and accident insurance policies doing business in those states can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof or insolvency by another insurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for a discussion of a matter involving an unaffiliated entity penn treaty which has been placed in rehabilitation 

certain optum businesses are also subject to regulatory and other risks and uncertainties in addition to the risks of our businesses of providing managed care and health insurance products for example state corporate practice of medicine doctrines and feesplitting rules can impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers optumhealth is subject to state telemedicine laws and regulations that apply to its telemedicine initiatives additionally optumhealth participates in the emerging private exchange markets and it is not yet known to what extent the states will issue new regulations that apply to private exchanges these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted margins or increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

we are also involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for a discussion of certain of these matters see also the risk factor below relating to our activities as a payer in various government health care programs for a discussion of audits by cms reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions which can result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity including as a result of routine governmental investigations the political debate surrounding the health reform legislation and the political environment in general negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price damage our reputation in various markets foster an increasingly active regulatory environment or result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices this may further increase our costs of doing business and the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

some of our businesses and operations are international in nature and consequently face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction the regulatory environments and associated requirements and uncertainties regarding tax licensing tariffs intellectual property privacy data protection investment management control fraud and anticorruption present additional challenges for us beyond those faced by usbased businesses such requirements and uncertainties may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or 

to do so at targeted margins or increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

for a discussion of various laws and regulations that impact our businesses see item 1 “business  government regulation” 

the enactment or implementation of health care reforms could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the first quarter of 2010 the health reform legislation was signed into law the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market as well as the medicaid and medicare programs and chip and other aspects of the health care system among other things the health reform legislation includes guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded establishes minimum medical loss ratios creates a federal premium review process imposes new requirements on the format and content of communications such as explanations of benefits or eobs between health insurers and their members grants to members new and additional appeal rights imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits reduces the medicare part d coverage gap and reduces payments to private plans offering medicare advantage 

certain provisions of the health reform legislation have already taken effect and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years hhs the dol and the treasury department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation remain pending due to the complexity of the health reform legislation the impact of the health reform legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known 

for example effective in 2011 the health reform legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for all commercial health plans in the large employer group small employer group and individual markets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for individuals calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and regulations companies with medical loss ratios below these targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually the potential for and size of the rebates will be measured by state by group size and by licensed subsidiary this disaggregation of insurance pools into much smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in the estimates of rebates owed in total effective in 2014 medicare advantage plans will be required to maintain a minimum medical loss ratio of 85 depending on the results of these calculations and the manner in which we adjust our business model in light of these requirements there could be meaningful disruptions in local health care markets and our market share revenues results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition the health reform legislation requires the establishment of statebased health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers by 2014 the types of exchange participation requirements ultimately enacted by each state the availability of federal premium subsidies within exchanges the potential for differential imposition of state benefit mandates inside and outside the exchanges the operation of reinsurance risk corridors and risk adjustment mechanisms inside and outside the exchanges and the possibility that certain states may restrict the ability of health plans to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small employers outside of the exchanges could result in disruptions in local health care markets and our revenues results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the health reform legislation includes a “maintenance of effort” moe provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for people covered by medicaid until the secretary of hhs determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state the moe provision is intended to prevent states from reducing eligibility standards and determination procedures as a way to remove adults above 133 of the federal poverty level from medicaid before implementation of expanded medicaid coverage effective in january 2014 however states with or projecting a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the moe provision if states are successful in obtaining moe waivers and allow certain medicaid programs to expire we could experience reduced medicaid enrollment which could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations financial position and cash flows 

several of the provisions in the health reform legislation will likely increase our medical cost trends examples of these provisions are the excise tax on medical devices annual fees on prescription drug manufacturers enhanced coverage requirements including discounted prescription drugs for medicare part d participants and the prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions the annual insurance industry assessment 8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter which is not deductible for income tax purposes will increase our operating costs premium increases will be necessary to offset the impact these and other provisions will have on our medical and operating costs these premium increases are oftentimes subject to state regulatory approval in this regard the federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by commercial health plans and providing funding to assist in those statelevel reviews we have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states including california new york and rhode island in addition as required under the health reform legislation hhs established a federal premium rate review process which became effective in september 2011 and generally 

applies to proposed rate increases equal to or exceeding 10 with statespecific thresholds to be applicable commencing september 2012 the regulations further require commercial health plans in the individual and small group markets to provide to the states and hhs extensive information supporting any rate increases subject to the new federal rate review process if we are not able to secure approval for adequate premium increases to offset increases in our cost structure our revenues results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in addition plans deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the statebased exchanges that become active under the health reform legislation in 2014 under the regulations the hhs rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets 

the congressional budget office has estimated that up to 34 million new individuals may eventually gain insurance coverage if the health reform legislation is implemented broadly in its current form in addition we expect that implementation of the health reform legislation will increase the demand for products and capabilities offered by our optum businesses we have made and will continue to make strategic decisions and investments based in part on these assumptions and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under the health reform legislation than estimated or we are unable to attract these new individuals to our unitedhealthcare offerings or if the demand for our optum businesses does not increase 

certain aspects of the health reform legislation are also being challenged in federal court with the proponents of such challenges seeking to limit the scope of or have all or portions of the health reform legislation declared unconstitutional the united states supreme court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on certain aspects of these cases in march 2012 including the constitutionality of the individual mandate congress may withhold the funding necessary to implement the health reform legislation or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether any partial or complete repeal or amendment or implementation difficulties or uncertainty regarding such events could materially and adversely impact our ability to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the health reform legislation or may cause us to incur additional costs of compliance for example if the individual mandate is declared unconstitutional or repealed without corresponding changes to other provisions of the health reform legislation to protect against the risk of adverse selection such as revisions to the guaranteed issue and renewal requirements prohibition on preexisting condition exclusions and rating restrictions our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

congress is also considering additional health care reform measures and a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the health reform legislation the effects of the health reform legislation and recently adopted state laws and the regulations that have been and will be promulgated thereunder are difficult to predict and we cannot predict whether any other federal or state proposals will ultimately become law such laws and rules could force us to materially change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments adversely change the nature of our contracted network relationships increase our medical and administrative costs and capital requirements expose us to an increased risk of liability including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our market share our results of operations our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by such changes 

for additional information regarding the health reform legislation see item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview  regulatory trends and uncertainties” 

as a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments and audits that could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care coverage programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs and chip and receive substantial revenues from these programs we also provide services to payers through our optum businesses these programs generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs for example cms reduced or froze medicare advantage benchmarks that drive reimbursements between 2009 and 2011 and beginning in 2012 additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks will take effect with changes being phasedin over two to six years depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis terminated benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these benchmark reductions there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the medicare advantage program 

as part of the health reform legislation cms has developed a system whereby a plan that meets certain quality ratings will 

be entitled to various quality bonus payments there can be no assurance that any of our plans will meet these quality ratings our revenues results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by funding reductions or if our plans do not meet the requirements to receive quality bonus payments similarly any reduction in medicare advantage payments could result in downward pressure on payments made to our collaborative care business in exchange for services provided to medicare advantage plans 

our participation in the medicare advantage medicare part d and various medicaid and chip programs occurs through bids that are submitted periodically revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities a reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations financial position and cash flows state medicaid programs are also imposing other reforms such as medical loss ratio requirements on medicaid managed care organizations which generally require such plans to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their state customers if they cannot demonstrate they have met the ratio standards 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjusting monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers as well as for medicare part d plans only based on comparing costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us in 2008 cms announced that it will perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit these audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans in december 2010 cms published for public comment a new proposed radv audit and payment adjustment methodology the proposed methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited using an extrapolation of the “error rate” identified in audit samples in february 2011 cms announced that it would be making changes to the proposed methodology based in part on comments submitted by industry participants as of the date of this filing cms has not published the revised methodology depending on the methodology utilized potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition the office of inspector general for hhs has audited our risk adjustment data for two local plans and has initially communicated its findings although we cannot predict the final outcome of the audit process any payment adjustments required as a result of the audits or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information regarding these audits 

cms conducts a variety of routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews across the industry for example in the fourth quarter of 2011 cms conducted an audit of our medicare advantage and part d business we are in the process of responding to preliminary findings as with any cms review in the event we fail to comply with applicable cms and state laws regulations and rules our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and we will not have additional members autoassigned to us for example we lost approximately 470000 of our autoenrolled lowincome subsidy members effective january 1 2012 because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or other programs on which we bid or our competitors submit bids at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf or if we fail to address emerging security threats or detect and prevent privacy and security incidents our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers these laws rules and requirements are subject to change further many of our businesses are subject to the payment card industry data security standards pci dss which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities see item 1 “business  government regulation” for additional information hipaa also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we still have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices 

our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents security attacks and breaches acts of vandalism or theft computer viruses coordinated attacks by activist entities emerging cybersecurity risks misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events emerging and advanced security threats including coordinated attacks require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations 

compliance with new laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain our ability to manage our business model for example our ability to collect disclose and use sensitive personal information may be further restricted and we are awaiting final hhs regulations for many key aspects of the arra amendments to hipaa such as with regard to marketing electronic health records and access reports which may necessitate system changes in addition hhs has announced a pilot audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities through 2012 although we are not aware of hhs plans to audit any of our covered entities an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows including the following consequences mandatory disclosure of a privacy or security breach to the media significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents enforcement actions material fines and penalties an impact on our ability to process credit card transactions as well as an increase in related expenses litigation compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pbm industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products  

we provide pbm services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers customers and consumers in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices see item 1 “business  government regulation” for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our pbm businesses 

optumrx also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose optumrx to civil and criminal penalties 

our pbm businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to timely process and dispense prescriptions and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition our pbm businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pbm businesses even where our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pbm businesses in connection with services for which our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations we 

could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions 

unitedhealthcare employer  individual is transitioning pharmacy benefit management for approximately 12 million of its commercial members including pharmacy claims adjudication and customer service from medco health solutions inc to optumrx beginning in 2013 if we are unable to execute the transition effectively unitedhealthcare employer  individual could face loss of business which could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations financial position and cash flows   could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate we compete with other companies on the basis of many factors including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives location and choice of health care providers quality of customer service comprehensiveness of coverage offered reputation for quality care financial stability and diversity of product offerings for our unitedhealthcare reporting segment competitors include aetna inc cigna corporation coventry health care inc health net inc humana inc kaiser permanente wellpoint inc numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the bluecross blueshield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare and medicaid specialty services for our optumrx business competitors include medco health solutions inc cvscaremark corporation and express scripts inc our optumhealth and optuminsight reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses 

in particular markets competitors may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements existing business relationships or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals in these industries consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or to maintain or increase profitability if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect if membership or demand for other services declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for services our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract for these services at competitive prices failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member under some capitated arrangements the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the 

services available to our members there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us for example we are involved in litigation with outofnetwork providers as described in more detail in “litigation matters” in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

accountable care organizations acos and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way that these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape these changes may affect the way that we price our products and estimate our costs and may require us to incur costs to change our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the success of certain optum businesses depends on maintaining satisfactory physician relationships the primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and hmo competitors of unitedhealthcare if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or hmo companies our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 

our products are sold in part through independent producers and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business we typically do not have longterm contracts with our producers and consultants who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend andor market health care products and services of our competitors as a result we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent producers and consultants or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to them regarding our product portfolio or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 

because producer commissions are included as administrative expenses under the medical loss ratio requirements of the health reform legislation these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other administrative costs our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures including potential reductions in commissions 

in addition there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling these companies products for example cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of producers who market medicare products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 

our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

under our agreements with aarp we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance hospital indemnity insurance and other products and services to aarp members under a supplement health insurance program the aarp program we also provide aarpbranded medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans to both aarp members and nonmembers our agreements with aarp extend to december 31 2017 for the aarp program and december 31 2014 for the medicare advantage and medicare part d offerings our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance corporate social responsibility diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances including depending on the 

agreement a material breach by either party insolvency of either party a material adverse change in our financial condition material changes in the medicare programs material harm to aarp caused by us and by mutual agreement the success of our aarp arrangements depends in part on our ability to service aarp and its members develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively meet our corporate governance corporate social responsibility and diversity commitments and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

because of the nature of our business we are routinely subject to various litigation actions which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties andor monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to among other things the design management and delivery of our product and service offerings these matters have included or could in the future include claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort including claims related to the delivery of health care services contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters however it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 

a description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in select markets and businesses  

unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions may continue to impact demand for certain of our products and services for example decreases in employment have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment in our employer group plans lower enrollment in our nonemployer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition unfavorable economic conditions could continue to adversely impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated andor received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings further unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses including health plans hmos hospitals care providers employers and others which could in turn materially and adversely affect optums financial results 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2011 relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have adversely impacted our investment income and a prolonged low interest rate environment could further 

adversely affect our investment income in addition a delay in payment of principal andor interest by issuers or defaults by issuers primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds could reduce our net investment income and we may be required to write down the value of our investments which would materially and adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity 

we also allocate a small proportion of our portfolio to equity investments which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments general economic conditions stock market conditions and many other factors beyond our control can materially and adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations changes in issuer financial conditions illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our shareholders equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially and adversely affected 

goodwill and other intangible assets were 268 billion as of december 31 2011 representing 39 of our total assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary for example the manner in or the extent to which the health reform legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in our business similarly the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions in addition from time to time we divest businesses and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders equity could in turn adversely impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 

largescale medical emergencies may result in significant medical costs and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

largescale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically for example in the event of a natural disaster bioterrorism attack pandemic or other extreme events we could face among other things significant medical costs and increased use of health care services any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to adequately price our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards emerging cybersecurity risks and threats and changing customer patterns if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting our systems against cybersecurity risks and threats enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to protect consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products and these products may contain unexpected design 

defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition an uncertain and rapidly evolving federal state international and industry legislative and regulatory framework related to the health information technology market may make it difficult to achieve and maintain compliance and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete in this market 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by states departments of insurance we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions successfully could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows for acquisitions success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each credit rating agencys opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders downgrades in our credit 

ratings should they occur may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows

executive overview 

general

optum serves health system participants including consumers physicians hospitals governments insurers distributors and pharmaceutical companies through its optumhealth optuminsight and optumrx businesses 

revenues 

our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from riskbased health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a oneyear period and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs effective in 2011 commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products as calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and implementing regulations that fall below certain targets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for individuals subject to statespecific exceptions are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually as a result our quarterly premium revenue may be reduced by a pro rata estimate of our fullyear premium rebate payable under the health reform legislation any required rebate payments for the current year are made in the third quarter of the subsequent year we also generate revenues from feebased services performed for customers that selfinsure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependants for both riskbased and feebased health care benefit arrangements we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services transaction processing health care professional services and access to contracted networks of physicians hospitals and other health care professionals we also generate service revenues from our optum businesses product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business we derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold or otherthantemporarily impaired 

operating costs 

medical costs  our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patientsconsumers health professionals hospitals pharmaceuticaltechnology manufacturers and other key stakeholders 

medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims and our estimates for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 

our medical care ratio calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues reflects the combination of pricing rebates benefit designs consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts 

operating costs  operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits agent and broker commissions premium taxes and assessments professional fees advertising and occupancy costs we seek to improve our operating cost ratio calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues for an equivalent mix of business however changes in business mix such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio

we generate cash primarily from premiums service and product revenues and investment income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs payments on debt purchases of investments acquisitions dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases for more information on our cash flows see “liquidity” below 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the us health economy which comprises approximately 18 of us gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years we expect overall spending on health care in the us to continue to grow in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the us population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and enacted health care reforms which could also impact our results of 

operations 

in 2012 we expect increasing unit costs to continue to be the primary cost driver of medical cost trends and we project steadily increasing medical system utilization over the course of the year we also expect an increase in prescription drug costs we will continue to work to manage medical cost trends through care management programs affordable network relationships payforperformance reimbursement programs for care providers and targeted clinical management programs and initiatives focused on improving quality and affordability additionally employers are continuing to select products with benefit designs that shift more of the costs to the employee this cost shifting continues to mitigate increases in medical cost trends 

our businesses focus on affordability consumer empowerment wellness and prevention payment innovations and enhanced distribution to better serve our customer and consumer needs and demands these business objectives are consistent with the goals of health care reform we expect that the portion of our costs that is tied to incentive contracts that reward providers for outcomebased results and improved cost efficiencies will continue to increase care providers are facing market pressures to change from feeforservice models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer integrated care across care providers and payforperformance payment structures this is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems the impact of such changes on our results of operations is uncertain but we expect them to moderate the rate at which medical costs increase this trend also provides growth opportunities for our optumhealth and optuminsight businesses 

we attempt to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends while balancing growth margins competitive dynamics and premium rebates at the local market level we seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business however changes in business mix such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio governmentsponsored public sector programs and health reform legislation may impact our premiums medical costs and medical care ratio in 2012 we continue to expect reimbursements to be under pressure through government payment rates and continued market competition in commercial products 

regulatory trends and uncertainties 

in the first quarter of 2010 the health reform legislation was signed into law the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market the medicaid and medicare programs chip and other aspects of the health care system hhs the dol the irs and the treasury department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation all of which have a variety of effective dates remain pending 

the health reform legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth and restrict premium rate increases in certain products and market segments increase our medical and administrative costs or expose us to an increased risk of liability any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also anticipate that the health reform legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality with a focus on prevention wellness and disease management we believe demand for many of our service offerings such as consulting services data management information technology and related infrastructure construction disease management and populationbased health and wellness programs will continue to grow 

following is a listing of some of the key provisions of the health reform legislation and other regulatory items along with managements view of the related trends and uncertainties that may cause reported financial information to not be indicative of future operating performance or of future financial condition 

premium rebates 

effective in 2011 commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually the potential for and size of the rebates are measured by state by group size and by licensed subsidiary 

in the aggregate the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained 

the disaggregation of insurance pools into smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in the estimates of rebates owed 

other market participants could implement changes to their business practices in response to the health reform legislation which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share insurers could elect to change pricing modify product features or benefits adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market they could also seek to adjust 

their operating costs by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on nonmedical product features and services we have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to the health reform legislation including reducing producer commissions and are implementing changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment these changes could impact future growth in these products 

commercial rate increase review 

the health reform legislation also requires hhs to maintain an annual review of “unreasonable” increases in premium rates for commercial health plans hhs established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10 with statespecific thresholds to be applicable commencing september 2012 and clarified that the hhs review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes the regulations further require commercial health plans to provide to the states and hhs extensive information supporting any rate increase of 10 or applicable state threshold or more under the regulations the hhs rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets 

the federal government is also encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by affected commercial health plans including large group plans and providing funding to assist in those statelevel reviews since august 2010 hhs has allocated approximately 250 million for grants to states to enable the states to conduct more robust reviews of requests for premium increases many states have applied for and received grants and state regulators have signaled their intent to more closely scrutinize premium rates 

premium rate review legislation ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states in 2011 as a result we have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states including california new york and rhode island depending on the level of scrutiny by the states there is a broad range of potential business impacts for example it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends leading to the risk of operating margin compression 

medicare advantage rates 

as part of the health reform legislation medicare advantage risk adjusted benchmarks which ultimately drive our cms payments were reduced by 16 in 2011 from 2010 levels beginning in 2012 additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks have taken effect benchmarks will ultimately range from 95 of medicare feeforservice rates in high cost areas to 115 in low cost areas with changes being phasedin over two to six years depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county these changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels 

we expect the 2012 rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs there are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions for example we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management adjust members benefits and decide on a countybycounty basis in which geographies to participate 

additionally achieving high quality scores from cms for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions we also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the increases in the number of people eligible for medicare in coming years longer term market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of medicare advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our medicare part d and medicare supplement insurance offerings 

it is also anticipated that cms will release the final medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv audit methodology in 2012 radv audits are intended to validate that the riskadjusted payments medicare advantage plans receive are supported by medical record data depending upon the final radv methodology released by cms recoveries from radv audits may result in additional rate pressure      

budget control acts medicare sequestration 

congress passed the budget control act of 2011 which following the failure of the joint select committee on deficit reduction to cut the federal deficit by 12 trillion triggers automatic acrosstheboard budget cuts sequestration including medicare spending cuts averaging 2 of total program costs for nine years starting in 2013 medicare payments exempted from sequestration include 

 32 

the office of management and budget is responsible for determining calculating and implementing cuts we are exploring strategies to mitigate any impact that may result from the cuts beginning in 2013 

insurance industry fee 

the health reform legislation includes an annual insurance industry assessment 8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter the annual fee will be allocated based on the ratio of an entitys net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any us health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year subject to certain exceptions and uncertainties 

our effective income tax rate will increase significantly in 2014 due to the nondeductibility of these fees 

premium increases will be necessary to offset the impact of these and other provisions premium increases are generally subject to state regulatory approval and potentially to federal review other market participants could increase premiums at different levels which could impact our market share positively or negatively 

statebased exchanges and coverage expansion 

effective in 2014 exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers as well as certain chip eligibles the exchanges will be statebased if a state fails to establish an exchange by the required deadline exchanges may be administered through a federalstate partnership or by the federal government 

among other things the health reform legislation eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits and restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded the health reform legislation also provides for expanded medicaid coverage effective in january 2014 the health reform legislation includes an moe provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for people covered by medicaid until the secretary of hhs determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state the moe provision is intended to prevent states from reducing eligibility standards and determination procedures as a way to remove adults above 133 of the federal poverty level from medicaid before implementation of expanded medicaid coverage effective in january 2014 however states with or projecting a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the moe provision additionally individual states may accelerate their procurement of medicaid managed care services in 2012 and 2013 for sizeable groups of medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads in advance of medicaid market expansion taking place in 2014 

the congressional budget office has estimated that up to 34 million additional individuals may eventually gain insurance coverage if the health reform legislation is implemented broadly in its current form this represents an opportunity for us to increase membership however serving these individuals may generate different profit margins than our existing business due to various factors including the health status of the newly insured individuals 

we expect existing participants in medicare and medicaid and new enrollees in statebased exchanges to transition between products and programs offering us opportunities to design products and services that enable us to compete for new business across business segments on an ongoing basis an acceleration of medicaid managed care services could increase nearterm business growth opportunities for unitedhealthcare community  state however if states are successful in obtaining moe waivers and allow certain medicaid programs to expire we could experience reduced medicaid enrollment 

court proceedings 

court proceedings related to the health reform legislation continue to evolve these court proceedings and the potential for congressional action to impede implementation create additional uncertainties with respect to the law for additional information regarding the health reform legislation see item 1 “business  government regulation” and item 1a “risk factors” 

results summary 

 selected operating performance and financial liquidity items 

the following represents a summary of selected 2011 operating and liquidity items these matters should not be considered by themselves see below for further discussion and analysis 

 

2011 results of operations compared to 2010 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

the increases in revenues for the year  ended december 31 2011  were driven by strong organic growth in the number of individuals served in our unitedhealthcare businesses commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends and revenue growth across all optum businesses 

medical costs 

medical costs for the year  ended december 31 2011  increased due to riskbased membership growth in our commercial and public and senior markets businesses and continued increases in the cost per service paid for health system use and a modest increase in health system utilization mainly in outpatient and physician office settings unit cost increases represented the majority of the increases in our medical cost trend with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals 

for each period our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period are included in total medical costs reported for the current period for 2011  and 2010  there was 720 million  and 800 million  respectively of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years the favorable development in both periods was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness which resulted in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels the favorable development in 2010 also benefited from a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers and favorable resolution of certain statebased assessments 

operating costs 

the increase in our operating costs for the year  ended december 31 2011  was due to business growth including an increased mix of optum and unitedhealthcare feebased and service revenues which have higher operating costs and increased spending related to reform readiness and compliance these factors were partially offset by overall operating cost management and the increase in 2010 operating costs due to the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3branded clinical trial service businesses see note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment 

income tax rate 

the effective income tax rate for the year  ended december 31 2011  decreased compared to the prior year due to favorable resolution of various historical tax matters in the current year as well as a higher effective income tax rate in 2010 due to the cumulative implementation of certain changes under the health reform legislation 

reportable segments 

our two business platforms unitedhealthcare and optum are comprised of four reportable segments 

 see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the types and services from which each of our reportable segments derives its revenues 

transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to unitedhealthcare customers by optumrx certain product offerings and clinical services sold to unitedhealthcare by optumhealth and health information and technology solutions consulting and other services sold to unitedhealthcare by optuminsight these transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation 

on january 1 2011 we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2011 presentation see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our business realignment the following table presents reportable segment financial information 



nm  not meaningful 

unitedhealthcare 

the following table summarizes unitedhealthcare revenue by business 



the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our unitedhealthcare businesses by major market segment and funding arrangement 



unitedhealthcares revenue growth for the year  ended december 31 2011  was due to growth in the number of individuals served across our businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting expected underlying medical cost trends 

unitedhealthcares earnings from operations for the year  ended december 31 2011  increased compared to the prior year as revenue growth and improvements in the operating cost ratio more than offset increased compliance costs and an increase to the medical care ratio which was primarily due to the initiation of premium rebate obligations in 2011 and lower favorable reserve development levels 

in our medicare part d standalone business we estimate that we entered january 2012 down approximately 625000 people primarily as a result of the loss of approximately 470000 of our autoassigned lowincome subsidy medicare part d beneficiaries in a number of regions being automatically reassigned to other plans as part of the annual bid process managed by cms we believe that we will grow from this level throughout the course of the year in the open retail market 

in february 2012 we added 117000 medicare advantage members from the acquisition of xlhealth corporation 

optum  total revenue for these businesses increased in 2011 due to business growth and acquisitions at optumhealth and optuminsight and growth in customers served through pharmaceutical benefit management programs at optumrx 

optum’s operating margin for the year  ended december 31 2011  was down compared to 2010 the decrease was due to changes in business mix within optum’s businesses and realignment of certain internal business arrangements 

the results by segment were as follows 

optumhealth 

increased revenues at optumhealth for the year  ended december 31 2011  were primarily due to expansions in service offerings through acquisitions in clinical services as well as growth in consumer and population health management offerings 

earnings from operations for the year  ended december 31 2011  and operating margin decreased compared to 2010 the decreases reflect the impact from internal business and service arrangement realignments and the mix effect of growth and expansion in newer businesses such as clinical services 

optuminsight 

increased revenues at optuminsight for the year  ended december 31 2011  were due to the impact of organic growth and the fullyear impact of 2010 acquisitions which were partially offset by the divestiture of the clinical trials services business in june 2011 

the increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for the year  ended december 31 2011  reflect an increased mix of higher margin services in 2011 as well as the effect on 2010 earnings from operations and operating margin of the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3branded clinical trial service businesses see note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment 

optumrx 

the increase in optumrx revenues for the year  ended december 31 2011  was due to increased prescription volumes primarily due to growth in customers served through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement business and a favorable mix of higher revenue specialty drug prescriptions intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were 167 billion  and 144 billion  for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively 

optumrx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011  decreased as the mix of lower margin specialty pharmaceuticals and medicaid business and investments to support growth initiatives including the insourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs more than offset the earnings contribution from higher revenues and greater use of generic medications 

we will consolidate and manage the majority of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs internally when our contract with medco health solutions inc expires at the end of 2012 the investments in our infrastructure and to expand our capacity will likely cause a decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin as in 2012 optumrx expects to absorb approximately 115 million of the 150 million consolidated insourcing related operating costs as a result of this transition optumrx expects to add 12 million members on a staged basis in 2013 see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of certain risks associated with the transition of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs to optumrx 

2010 results of operations compared to 2009 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

the increases in revenues for 2010 were primarily due to strong organic growth in riskbased benefit offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends growth in customers served by our health services businesses particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs increased revenues from public sector behavioral health programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth 

medical costs and medical care ratio 

medical costs for 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets riskbased businesses and medical cost inflation which were partially offset by net favorable development of prior period medical costs 

for 2010 and 2009 there was 800 million and 310 million respectively of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 

the medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously 

operating costs 

operating costs for 2010 increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at optuminsight which is discussed in more detail below an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the medicare advantage annual enrollment period costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation increased advertising costs and the absorption of new business development and startup costs 

income tax rate 

the increase in our effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the 2010 rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation due to the health reform legislation 

reportable segments 

unitedhealthcare 

the revenue growth in unitedhealthcare for 2010 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends partially offset by medicare advantage premium rate decreases 

unitedhealthcare earnings from operations and operating margins for 2010 increased over the prior year due to factors that increased revenues described above continued cost management disciplines on behalf of our commercial and governmental 

customers a general moderation in yearoveryear growth in demand for medical services and the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs 

optumhealth 

increased revenues in optumhealth for 2010 were primarily driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets 

the operating margin for 2010 decreased due to growth in lower margin public sector business new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the federal mental health parity  addiction equity act of 2008 

optuminsight 

increased revenues in optuminsight for 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance 

the decrease in operating margin for 2010 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3branded clinical trial service businesses in addition increases in the mix of lower margin business continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas also contributed to the decrease in operating margin in 2010 see note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment 

optumrx 

the increased optumrx revenues for 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement business and higher prescription volumes intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were 144 billion and 125 billion for 2010 and 2009 respectively 

optumrx operating margin for 2010 decreased due to changes in performancebased pricing contracts with medicare part d plan sponsors which were partially offset by prescription volume growth increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short and longterm obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses the risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses geographies and customers our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our riskbased businesses and continued productivity improvements that lower our operating costs 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash cash equivalents and investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected shortterm obligations in longer term liquid investmentgrade debt securities to improve our overall investment return we make these investments pursuant to our board of directors approved investment policy which focuses on preservation of capital through risk tolerances around liquidity credit quality issuer limits asset class diversification income and duration the policy emphasizes investment grade bonds with durations that are short to intermediate term in nature the policy also generally governs return objectives regulatory limitations and tax implications 

our regulated subsidiaries are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the naic these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies except in the case of extraordinary dividends these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus these dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval if the dividend together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus the entire dividend is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval 

in 2011 based on the 2010 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was 34 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2011  our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 45 billion  including 11 billion  of extraordinary dividends for the year ended december 31 2010  our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 32 billion  including 686 million  of extraordinary dividends 

our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or drawings under our committed credit facility further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends andor repurchases of our common stock depending on market conditions 

summary of our major sources and uses of cash 



2011 cash flows compared to 2010 cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased 695 million  or 11  from 2010 the increase was primarily driven by growth in net earnings and changes in various working capital accounts which were partially offset by a reduction in unearned revenues due to the early receipt of certain 2011 state medicaid premium payments in 2010 which increased 2010 cash from operating activities we anticipate lower year over year cash flows from operations in 2012 which will include payments in the third quarter for 2011 premium rebate obligations 

cash flows used for investing activities decreased 12 billion  or 22  primarily due to relatively lower investments in acquisitions in 2011 and a decrease in net purchases of investments we anticipate an increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2012 as compared to 2011 

cash flows used for financing activities increased 879 million  or 55  primarily due to increased share repurchases and cash dividends in 2011 partially offset by an increase in net borrowings 

2010 cash flows compared to 2009 cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased 648 million or 12 for 2010 factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings an acceleration of certain 2011 premium payments and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections which were partially offset by a mandated acceleration in the claim payment cycle associated with the medicare part d program and payment for the settlement of the american medical association class action litigation 

related to reimbursement for outofnetwork medical services 

cash flows used for investing activities increased 44 billion primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2010 decreases in sales of investments due to a more stable market environment and the use of operating cash to purchase investments 

cash flows used for financing activities decreased 664 million or 29 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and longterm debt partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid on our common stock 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2011  our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 280 billion  included 94 billion  of cash and cash equivalents of which 16 billion  was held by nonregulated entities 180 billion  of debt securities and 544 million  of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies primarily used in valuing our level 3 securities those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments due to the subjective nature of these assumptions the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date we had 417 million  of level 3 securities as of december 31 2011  other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our 30 billion  bank credit facility reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our fair value measurements 

our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weightedaverage duration of 21 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2011  included in the debt securities balance are 24 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers the weightedaverage credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “aa” as of december 31 2011  we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor neither indirect through the guarantees nor direct through investment in the guarantor when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weightedaverage credit rating 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper  we maintain a commercial paper borrowing program which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through thirdparty brokerdealers the commercial paper program is supported by the 30 billion  bank credit facility described below as of december 31 2011  we had no commercial paper outstanding 

bank credit facility   in december 2011  we amended and renewed our fiveyear revolving bank credit facility with 21  banks which will mature in december 2016  the amendment included increasing the borrowing capacity to 30 billion  this facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2011  the interest rate on borrowings is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the libor plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings as of december 31 2011  the annual interest rate on this facility had it been drawn would have ranged from 12  to 17  

our bank credit facility contains various covenants including requiring us to maintain a debt to debtplusequity ratio below 50 our debt to debtplusequity ratio calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity was 291  and 301  as of december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  respectively we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of december 31 2011  

longterm debt  periodically we access capital markets and issue longterm debt for general corporate purposes and the funds may be used for example to meet our working capital requirements to refinance debt to finance acquisitions for share repurchases or for other general corporate purposes 

in november 2011 we issued 15 billion  in senior unsecured notes the issuance included 400 million  of 19  fixedrate notes due november 2016 500 million  of 34  fixedrate notes due november 2021 and 600 million  of 46  notes due november 2041 

in february 2011 we issued 750 million in senior unsecured notes the issuance included 400 million of 47 fixedrate 

notes due february 2021 and 350 million of 60 fixedrate notes due february 2041 

credit ratings  our credit ratings at december 31 2011  were as follows 



  

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital we have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital 

share repurchases  under our board of directors’ authorization we maintain a common share repurchase program repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions including prepaid or structured repurchase programs subject to certain preset parameters established by our board in may 2011  our board renewed our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million  shares of our common stock during the year  ended december 31 2011  we repurchased 65 million  shares at an average price of approximately 46  per share and an aggregate cost of 30 billion  as of december 31 2011  we had board authorization to purchase up to an additional 65 million shares of our common stock 

dividends  in may 2011  our board of directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of 065  per share paid quarterly since june 2010  we had paid a quarterly dividend of 0125  per share declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change on february 8 2012 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 01625 per share 

the following table provides details of our dividend payments and annual dividend rate 



contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2011  under our various contractual obligations and commitments 



 we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations this includes internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2011  we were not involved in offbalance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

in july 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201106 “other expenses topic 720 fees paid to the federal government by health insurers a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force” asu 201106 this update addresses the recognition and classification of an entitys share of the annual health insurance industry assessment the fee mandated by health reform legislation the fee will be levied on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after january 1 2014 and is not deductible for income tax purposes the fee will be allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of an entitys net health premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any us health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year in accordance with the amendments in asu 201106 our liability for the fee will be estimated and recorded in full once we provide qualifying health insurance in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable first applicable in 2014 with a corresponding deferred cost that will be amortized to expense using a straightline method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable 

we have determined that there have been no other recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs 

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim processing backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption health care professional contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service we estimate liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions 

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2011  2010  and 2009  included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of 720 million  800 million  and 310 million  respectively this development represented approximately 8 9 and 4 of the medical claims payable balance as of december 31 2010  2009  and 2008 respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36month period a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation for months prior to the most recent three months we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicatedtodate to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months for the most recent three months we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors this approach is consistently applied from period to period 

completion factors  completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods generally periods prior to the most recent three months the completion factor includes judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated our reserves may be significantly impacted 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2011  

  



medical cost pmpm trend factors  medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months provider contracting and expected unit costs benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variables such as grossdomestic product growth employment and disposable income a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical costs changes in level and mix of services utilized mix of benefits offered including the impact of copays and deductibles changes in medical practices catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31 2011  

  



the analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2011  developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2011  however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2011  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates 2011  net earnings would have increased or decreased by 56 million and diluted net earnings per common share would have increased or decreased by 005 per share 

the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation these include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals we emphasize preventive health care appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards education and closing gaps in care 

we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful however other factors including competitive pressures new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers major epidemics and applicable 

regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation because of the narrow operating margins of our riskbased products changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 

revenues 

revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services as recorded in our records effective in 2011 premium revenue subject to the premium rebates of the health reform legislation are recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract when that amount can be reasonably estimated the estimated premium is revised each period to reflect current experience the most significant factors in estimating these rebates are financial performance within each aggregation set including medical claim experience and effective tax rates as well as changes in business mix and regulatory requirements we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 

our medicare advantage and part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under cms risk adjustment payment methodology the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier we and other health care plans collect capture and submit available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines cms uses submitted diagnosis codes demographic information and special statuses to determine the risk score for most medicare advantage beneficiaries cms also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations the actual amount of cms retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and accordingly our profitability medicare advantage risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information regarding these audits 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

to determine whether goodwill is impaired we perform a multistep impairment test first we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values if the qualitative analysis is not conclusive or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 

we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates for each reporting unit comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

forecasts and longterm growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with and use inputs from our internal longterm business plan and strategy key assumptions used in these forecasts include 

 although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units due to the 

longterm nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections that uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in item 1 “business  government regulation” for additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and how other factors could affect our business and the related longterm forecasts see item 1a “risk factors” in part i and regulatory trends and uncertainties above 

discount rates are determined for each reporting unit based on the implied risk inherent in their forecasts this risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples beyond our selection of the most appropriate riskfree rates and equity risk premiums our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unitspecific factors such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and companyspecific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit companyspecific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty 

the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future 

we elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of january 1 2012 all of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values thus we concluded that there was no need for any impairment of our goodwill balances as of december 31 2011 

intangible assets finitelived separatelyidentifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance eg membership lists customer contracts trademarks and technology we do not have material holdings of indefinitelived intangible assets our intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values and are then amortized over their expected useful lives our most significant intangible assets are customerrelated intangibles which represent 88 of our total intangible balance of 28 billion  

customerrelated intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition the most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customerrelated assets include projected revenue and earnings growth retention rate perpetuity growth rate and discount rate these initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results eg customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested 

our intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finitelived intangible assets or asset groups carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including changes in the use of an intangible asset changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value experienced or expected operating cashflow deterioration or losses adverse changes in customer populations adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors following the identification of any potential impairment indicators we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finitelived intangible asset using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded 

there were no material impairments of finitelived intangible assets during 2011 

investments 

as of december 31 2011  we had investments with a carrying value of 187 billion  primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses net of income tax effects as a separate component in shareholders equity 

we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2011  our investments had gross unrealized gains of 787 million  and gross unrealized losses of 32 million  we evaluate investments for impairment considering factors including 

 47 

for debt securities if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security we recognize the entire impairment in earnings if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss which is recognized in earnings and all other causes which are recognized in other comprehensive income 

for equity securities we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity securitys cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period if we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term we recognize the impairment in through our income statement 

inherently there is uncertainty included in the impairment assessment of investments our analysis includes significant judgments and estimates including the fair value of the investment the underlying credit quality of the issuers and the credit ratings of the issuer other forms of credit enhancements the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and general industry and sector economic conditions 

fair values we perform an analysis around the fair values of the securities held including obtaining an understanding of the pricing method and procedures over the valuation of securities fair values of availableforsale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices where available we obtain one price for each security primarily from a thirdparty pricing service pricing service which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value the pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information for securities not actively traded the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include but are not limited to benchmark yields credit spreads default rates and prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes as we are responsible for the determination of fair value we perform quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value specifically we compare 

 based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service 

otherthantemporary impairment assessment   individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the factors above including the length of time of impairment credit standing financial condition near termprospects and other factors specific to the issuer other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and liquidity given the nature of our portfolio primarily investment grade securities the primary causes of historical impairments were market related eg interest rate fluctuations etc as opposed to credit related we do not expect that trend to change in the near term generally we do not assume that we will be required   to sell a security because our large cash holdings reduce this risk however our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change 

we believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value the unrealized losses at december 31 2011 and 2010 were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities mortgagebacked securities and corporate debt obligations substantially all of investmentgrade quality securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy total otherthantemporary impairments during 2011 2010 and 2009 were 12 million  23 million  and 64 million  respectively our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weightedaverage duration of 21 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2011 we have minimal securities collateralized by subprime or alta securities and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default 

the judgments and estimates related to fair value and otherthantemporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including circumstances may change over time industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold our assessment of the financial 

condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including current facts and circumstances changing or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop 

as discussed further in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a 1 increase in market interest rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by 622 million  

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence both positive and negative for which it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized after application of the valuation allowances we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 

according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits 

we have established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under us gaap we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 

the significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year a hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on our 2011 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by 80 million 

contingent liabilities 

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel if appropriate and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage if any for such matters 

estimates of probable costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving us are inherently difficult to predict particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines penalties or punitive damages present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies are in the early stages of the proceedings or could result in a change in business practices accordingly in many cases we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred 

given this inherent uncertainty it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions we evaluate our related disclosures each reporting period see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is included in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference in this report 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base as of december 31 2011  we had an aggregate 19 billion  reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005 we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery currently the reinsurer is rated by am best as “a” as of december 31 2011  there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt and b changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 

as of december 31 2011  94 billion of our investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also optumhealth bank held 14 billion of deposit liabilities as of december 31 2011  at interest rates that vary with market rates 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2011  182 billion  of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 116 billion  of our debt was fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities as well as endeavoring to match our floatingrate assets and liabilities over time either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts in the second half of 2011 we terminated all of our interest rate swap fair value hedges with a 54 billion  notional amount in order to lockin the impact of low market floating interest rates and reduce the effective interest rate on hedged longterm debt the gain of 132 million  will be realized over the remaining life of the applicable hedged fixedrate debt as a reduction to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations additional information on our interest rate swaps is included in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements since the interest rate swaps have been terminated the fair value of our longterm debt is now more sensitive to hypothetical changes in interest rates as the change in the fair value of the debt is no longer offset by the swaps also as a result of the swaps termination our exposure to hypothetical changes in market rates on our interest expense is less volatile 

the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 or 2 as of december 31 2011  and 2010  on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions 





nm  not meaningful 

  

 as of december 31 2011  we had 544 million  of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds a portion of which were invested in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will impact the value of our equity investments

controls and procedures 

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

in connection with the filing of this form 10k management evaluated under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2011  based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2011  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2011  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011   

the companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control  integrated framework  based on our assessment and those criteria we believe that as of december 31 2011  the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 

the companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  as stated in the report of independent registered public accounting firm appearing under item 9a which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2011

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and stockholders of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2011  based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  based on the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2011  of the company and our reports dated february 8 2012  expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

government regulation 

most of our health and wellbeing services are regulated by federal and state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically in the first quarter of 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and a reconciliation measure the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we refer to together as the health reform legislation were signed into law the health reform legislation portions of which are summarized below alters the regulatory environment in which we operate in some cases to a significant degree federal and state governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system new laws regulations and rules or changes in the interpretation of existing laws regulations and rules could negatively affect our business 

we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws regulations and rules in the event we fail to comply with or we fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in applicable laws regulations 

  

and rules our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal and state laws and regulations 

health care reforms 

the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market as well as the medicaid and medicare programs chip and other aspects of the health care system certain provisions of the health reform legislation have already taken effect and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years the department of health and human services hhs the department of labor dol and the treasury department have issued regulations or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation but we await final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation 

certain aspects of the health reform legislation are also being challenged in federal court with the proponents of such challenges seeking to limit the scope of or have all or portions of the health reform legislation declared unconstitutional for example on january 31 2011 in a case brought on behalf of 26 state attorneys general andor governors and certain other parties the united states district court for the northern district of florida ruled that the provision in the health reform legislation that requires individuals to purchase health insurance or be subject to penalties along with the entire legislation is unconstitutional the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia has held that the individual mandate and certain related provisions are unconstitutional but without declaring the entire legislation unconstitutional in contrast federal district court judges in virginia and michigan have upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the health reform legislation there are other cases challenging aspects of the health reform legislation that remain pending and have not yet been decided judicial proceedings are subject to appeal and could last for an extended period of time and we cannot predict the results of any of these proceedings congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the health reform legislation or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether 

the following outlines certain provisions of the health reform legislation that have taken or will take effect in the coming years assuming the legislation is implemented in its current form 

effective 2010  the health reform legislation mandated the expansion of dependent coverage to include adult children until age 26 eliminated certain annual and lifetime caps on the dollar value of certain essential health benefits eliminated preexisting condition limits for enrollees under 19 prohibited certain policy rescissions prohibited plans and issuers from charging higher cost sharing copayments or coinsurance for emergency services that are obtained out of a plan’s network and included a requirement to provide coverage for preventive services without cost to members for nongrandfathered plans 

the health reform legislation also mandated certain changes to coverage determination and appeals processes including expanding the definition of “adverse benefit determination” to include rescissions extending external review rights of adverse benefit determinations to insured and selffunded plans requiring urgent care coverage determinations to be made and communicated within 24 hours and improving the clarity of and expanding the types of information in adverse benefit determination notices 

effective 2011  beginning in 2011 commercial fully insured health plans in the large employer group small employer group and individual markets with medical loss ratios below certain targets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for individuals calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and regulations will be required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually rebate payments if any for 2011 would be made in mid 2012 a state can request a waiver of the individual market medical loss ratio for up to three years if the state petitions and provides to hhs certain supporting data and hhs determines that the requirement is disruptive to the market in that state in addition effective in 2011 the health reform legislation mandates consumer discounts of 50 on brand name prescription drugs and 7 on generic prescription drugs for part d plan participants in the coverage gap 

  

in addition the health reform legislation required hhs to maintain an annual review process of “unreasonable” increases in premiums for commercial health plans hhs recently issued a proposed regulation that defines a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10 for rate increases filed or effective july 1 2011 or later the proposed rule also clarifies that hhs review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes the proposed regulation further requires health plans to provide to the states and hhs extensive information supporting any premium rate increase of 10 or more regardless of whether such increase ultimately is or is not deemed “unreasonable” this information is expected to be made public by the states andor hhs 

effective 20112012  as part of the health reform legislation medicare advantage payment rates for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels separately cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of 16 for 2011 beginning in 2012 additional cuts to medicare advantage plans will take effect plans will ultimately receive 95 of medicare feeforservice rates in high cost areas to 115 in low cost areas with changes being phasedin over two to six years depending on the level of payment reduction in a county in addition to other measures quality bonuses may partially offset these anticipated rate reductions as cms quality rating bonuses are phased in over three years beginning in 2012 

effective 2013  effective beginning in 2013 with respect to services performed after 2009 the health reform legislation limits the deductibility of executive compensation under section 162m of the internal revenue code for insurance providers if at least 25 of the insurance provider’s gross premium income from health business is derived from health insurance plans that meet the minimum creditable coverage requirements 

effective 20132014  the health reform legislation provides for an increase in medicaid feeforservice and managed care program reimbursements for primary care services provided by primary care doctors family medicine general internal medicine or pediatric medicine to 100 of the medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014 and provides 100 federal financing for the difference in rates based on rates applicable on july 1 2009 

effective 2014  effective starting in 2014 a number of the provisions of the health reform legislation are scheduled to take effect including the following an annual insurance industry assessment 8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter which is not deductible for income tax purposes expansion of medicaid eligibility for all individuals and families with incomes up to 133 of the federal poverty level states can early adopt the expansion without increased federal funding prior to 2014 states receive full federal matching in 2014 through 2016 all individual and group health plans must offer coverage on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis during annual open enrollment and special enrollment periods and cannot apply preexisting condition exclusions or health status rating adjustments elimination of annual limits on essential benefits coverage on certain plans establishment of statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to 100 employees as well as certain chip eligibles introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values to increase comparability of competing products on the exchanges and establishment of minimum medical loss ratio of 85 for medicare advantage plans 

the health reform legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments increase our medical and administrative costs expose us to an increased risk of liability including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our results of operations financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes the health reform legislation may create new or expand existing opportunities for business growth but due to its complexity the impact of the health reform legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known see also item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to the health reform legislation and related matters

we are subject to various levels of federal regulation cms regulates our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and unitedhealthcare community  state medicare and medicaid businesses as well as certain aspects of our optumhealth business cms has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care given to medicare beneficiaries see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for a discussion of audits of our risk adjustment data for several of our plans 

our health benefits reporting segment through unitedhealthcare community  state also has medicaid and chip contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services and other aspects of these programs there are many regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs has become and will continue to become increasingly complex as a result of the health reform legislation when we contract with the federal government we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts in addition certain of ingenix’s businesses such as its high acuity software products and clinical research activities are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and the clinical research activities are also subject to laws and regulations outside of the united states that regulate clinical trials laws and regulations relating to consumer protection antifraud and abuse antikickbacks false claims prohibited referrals inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services antimoney laundering securities and antitrust also affect us

federal privacy and security requirements change frequently because of legislation regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation for example the us congress enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra which significantly amends and adds new privacy and security provisions to hipaa and imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information aara includes new contracting requirements for hipaa business associate agreements extends parts of hipaa privacy and security provisions to business associates adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to hhs and the federal trade commission ftc and in some cases to the local media strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for hipaa violations and in certain cases imposes criminal penalties for individuals including employees hhs has indicated that it will issue regulations this year on key aspects of hipaa primarily arra amendments to hipaa in the conduct of our business we may act depending on the circumstances as either a covered entity or a business associate federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws including the grammleachbliley act glba or state statutes implementing glba which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with hipaa glba and other privacyrelated regulations

state laws and regulation 

health care regulation our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate those products and operations these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements with the amendment of the annual financial reporting model regulation by the national association of insurance commissioners naic to adopt elements substantially similar to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we expect that these states will continue to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of hmos and insurance companies in addition the states were very active in 2010 and passed various laws to implement limit and in the majority of instances expand the entitlements set forth in the federal health reform legislation we expect the states to continue to introduce and pass similar laws in 2011 and this will affect our operations and our financial results 

health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates these laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies

privacy and security laws states have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the glba like hipaa glba allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection a number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices for example state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information state and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information state consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers additionally different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacyrelated regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections guidance or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words or phrases “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “plan” project” “should” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements 

the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address or update forwardlooking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications 

if we fail to effectively estimate price for and manage our medical costs the profitability of our riskbased products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results 

under our riskbased product arrangements we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased products comprise approximately 90 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our riskbased products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs in this regard the health reform legislation requires hhs to maintain an annual review process of “unreasonable” increases in premiums for commercial health plans and states have a variety of premium review and approval processes that are receiving increased scrutiny 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period however medical cost inflation regulation and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly 

  

treatments and technology new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use as a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if medical costs increased by 1 without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products our annual net earnings for 2010 would have been reduced by approximately 190 million 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove too low they will have a negative impact on our future results 

our business activities are highly regulated new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change for example in the first quarter of 2010 the health reform legislation was signed into law legislating broadbased changes to the us health care system see item 1 “business – government regulation” for a discussion of the health reform legislation 

the broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering regulations governing our business as well as future laws and rules and interpretation of those laws and rules by governmental enforcement authorities could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions for example in october 2008 congress enacted the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 mhpaea which requires insurers to provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits under terms that are no more restrictive than those applied to medical and surgical benefits the mhpaea specifically directed the secretaries of labor health and human services and the treasury to issue regulations to implement the legislation although regulations regarding how the mhpaea was to be implemented were issued on february 2 2010 in the form of an interim final rule final regulations have not yet been published and interpretative guidance from the regulators has been limited to date because of the broad range of treatment limitations to which parity is expected to apply under the regulations the regulations will likely lead to an increase in the costs associated with both insured and selfinsured plans for behavioral health benefits and services and impact our market for carveout health benefit administration which could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations 

we must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions including integration of certain acquisitions delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 

under state guaranty fund laws certain insurance companies and hmos in some states including those issuing health which includes longterm care life and accident insurance policies doing business in those states can be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof or insolvency by another insurer could have an adverse effect on our results of operations see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for a discussion of a matter involving penn treaty which has been placed in rehabilitation 

certain optumhealth businesses are also subject to regulatory and other risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our businesses of providing managed care and health insurance products for example the businesses are subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws and regulations such as those that govern 

  

socalled corporate practice of medicine and feesplitting which govern their relationships with physicians hospitals and customers 

additionally our financial services business may be impacted by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which became law on july 21 2010 the act calls for extensive rulemaking including debit card interchange fees restrictions and network exclusivity and routing requirements and depending on rulemaking and implementation activities could subject us to additional regulation increase operational costs and reduce revenue 

we are also involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these regulatory activities include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general the office of the inspector general the office of personnel management the office of civil rights us congressional committees the us department of justice us attorneys the sec the irs the us department of labor the fdic and other governmental authorities for example in 2007 the california department of insurance examined our pacificare health insurance plan in california the examination findings related to the timeliness and accuracy of claims processing interest payments provider contract implementation provider dispute resolution and other related matters the matter is now the subject of an administrative proceeding before an administrative law judge see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for a discussion of this matter see also the risk factor below relating to our activities as a payer in various government health care programs for a discussion of audits of data used in determining cms payment rates 

reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions which can result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in addition the health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity negative publicity including negative publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations or the political environment may adversely affect our stock price damage our reputation in various markets and result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services requiring us to change our products and services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our businesses see item 1 “business — government regulation” 

the enactment or implementation of health care reforms could materially adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our revenues financial position and results of operations 

in the first quarter of 2010 the health reform legislation was signed into law the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market as well as the medicaid and medicare programs and chip and other aspects of the health care system among other things the health reform legislation includes guaranteed coverage requirements eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded establishes minimum medical loss ratios creates a federal premium review process imposes new requirements on the format and content of communications such as explanations of benefits or eobs between health insurers and their members grants to members new and additional appeal rights imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits reduces the medicare part d coverage gap and reduces payments to private plans offering medicare advantage 

  

certain provisions of the health reform legislation have already taken effect and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years hhs the dol and the treasury department have issued regulations or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation but we await final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation due to the complexity of the health reform legislation the impact of the health reform legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known 

for example the health reform legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for all commercial health plans in the large employer group small employer group and individual markets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for individuals calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and regulations companies with medical loss ratios below these targets will be required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually depending on the results of the calculation and the manner in which we adjust our business model in light of this requirement there could be meaningful disruptions in local health care markets and our market share revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition the health reform legislation requires the establishment of statebased health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers by 2014 the types of exchange participation requirements ultimately enacted by each state the availability of federal premium subsidies within exchanges the potential for differential imposition of state benefit mandates inside and outside the exchanges and the possibility that certain states may restrict the ability of health plans to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small employers outside of the exchanges could result in disruptions in local health care markets and our revenues financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

several of the provisions in the health reform legislation will likely increase our medical cost trends examples of these provisions are the excise tax on medical devices annual fees on prescription drug manufacturers enhanced coverage requirements and the prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions the annual insurance industry assessment 8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter which is not deductible for income tax purposes will increase our operating costs premium increases will be necessary to offset the impact these and other provisions will have on our medical and operating costs these premium increases are oftentimes subject to state regulatory approval and as required under the health reform legislation hhs recently issued proposed rules that if implemented would establish a federal premium rate review process for annual premium rate increases generally of 10 or more if we are not able to secure approval for adequate premium increases to offset increases in our cost structure our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition plans deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the statebased exchanges that become active under the health reform legislation in 2014 

the congressional budget office has estimated that up to 32 million new individuals may eventually gain insurance coverage if the health reform legislation is implemented broadly in its current form in addition we expect that implementation of the health reform legislation will increase the demand for products and capabilities offered by our health services businesses we have made and will continue to make strategic decisions and investments based in part on these assumptions and our results of operations or financial position could be adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under the health reform legislation than estimated or we are unable to attract these new individuals to our health benefits offerings or if the demand for our health services businesses does not increase 

certain aspects of the health reform legislation are also being challenged in federal court with the proponents of such challenges seeking to limit the scope of or have all or portions of the health reform legislation declared unconstitutional for example on january 31 2011 in a case brought on behalf of 26 state attorneys general andor governors and certain other parties the united states district court for the northern district of florida ruled that the provision in the health reform legislation that requires individuals to purchase health insurance or be subject to penalties along with the entire legislation is unconstitutional the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia has held that the individual mandate and certain related provisions are unconstitutional but without declaring the entire legislation unconstitutional congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the health reform legislation or may attempt to replace the legislation with 

  

amended provisions or repeal it altogether any partial or complete repeal or amendment or implementation difficulties or uncertainty regarding such events could adversely impact our ability to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the health reform legislation or may cause us to incur additional costs of compliance for example if the individual mandate is declared unconstitutional without corresponding changes to other provisions of the health reform legislation to protect against the risk of adverse selection such as revisions to the guaranteed issue and renewal requirements prohibition on preexisting condition exclusions and rating restrictions our financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

congress is also considering additional health care reform measures and a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets the effects of the health reform legislation and recently adopted state laws and the regulations that have been and will be promulgated thereunder are difficult to predict and we cannot predict whether any other federal or state proposals will ultimately become law such laws and rules could force us to materially change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments change the nature of our contracted network relationships increase our medical and administrative costs and capital requirements expose us to an increased risk of liability including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our results of operations our market share our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes 

for additional information regarding the health reform legislation see item 1 “business — government regulation” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — executive overview — business trends — health care reforms” 

as a payer in various government health care programs we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments and audits that could adversely affect our revenues cash flows and results of operations 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care coverage programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs and chip and receive revenues from these programs these programs generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs for example in 2009 cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of approximately 5 for 2010 and as part of the health reform legislation medicare advantage payment rates for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels separately cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of 16 for 2011 beginning in 2012 additional cuts to medicare advantage plans will take effect with changes being phasedin over two to six years depending on the level of payment reduction in a county 

although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis terminated benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the medicare advantage program as part of the health reform legislation cms has developed a system whereby plans that meet certain quality ratings will be entitled to various quality bonus payments and there can be no assurance that our plans will meet these quality ratings our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by funding reductions or if our plans do not meet the requirements to receive quality bonus payments 

our participation in the medicare advantage medicare part d and various medicaid and chip programs occurs through bids that are submitted periodically revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various 

  

payment mechanisms funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including adjusting monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers in 2008 cms announced that it will perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit these audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans in december 2010 cms published for public comment a new proposed radv audit and payment adjustment methodology the proposed methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited using an extrapolation of the “error rate” identified in audit samples depending on the methodology utilized potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition we are in discussions with the office of inspector general for hhs regarding audits of our risk adjustment data for two local plans we are unable to predict the outcome of these audits and discussions however any payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information regarding these audits 

in 2009 as part of arra and in an effort to relieve pressure resulting from state fiscal problems and rising medicaid enrollments congress increased the federal medical assistance percentage fmap temporarily increasing federal funding for state medicaid programs the enhanced fmap was set to expire at the end of 2010 federal legislation was passed in august 2010 that extended additional enhanced fmap funding through june 2011 the ability of states to sustain their medicaid programs may be adversely affected if congress does not continue the enhanced fmap beyond june 2011 which could result in a reduction of the scope of the programs member disenrollment rate reductions or other adverse actions 

under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold which is calculated by the government after our bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and we will not have additional members autoassigned to us for example we lost approximately 650000 of our autoenrolled lowincome subsidy members in 2008 because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or other programs on which we bid or our competitors submit bids that are more favorable than our bids our results of operations could be materially affected 

if we fail to comply with requirements of privacy and security regulations including taking steps to ensure that our thirdparty service providers who obtain access to sensitive personal information maintain its confidentiality and security our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information by our businesses are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the 

  

privacy and security provisions in the federal glba and in hipaa hipaa now requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements see item 1 “business — government regulation” for a discussion of various federal and state privacy laws and regulations governing our businesses 

even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we still have limited control over their actions and practices privacy and security requirements regarding sensitive personal information are also imposed on us through controls with our customers in addition despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism or theft computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events compliance with new privacy and security laws requirements and new regulations such as arra will result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes including further implementation of encryption and other data protection standards new limitations or constraints on our business models the development of new administrative processes the effects of potential noncompliance by our thirdparty service providers and increased enforcement actions and fines and penalties they also may impose further restrictions on our collection disclosure and use of sensitive personal information that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases we are awaiting final hhs regulations for many key aspects of the arra amendments to hipaa 

noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations including mandatory disclosure to the media significant increase in the number and cost of managing and remediating data security incidents increased enforcement actions material fines and penalties compensatory special punitive and statutory damages litigation consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pbm industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products 

we provide pbm services through our prescription solutions and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers customers and consumers in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices see item 1 “business — government regulation” for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our pbm businesses 

our pbm businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pbm businesses even where our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pbm businesses in connection with services for which our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions 

prescription solutions also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose prescription solutions to civil and criminal penalties further prescription solutions is subject to the payment card industry data security standards which is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management policies procedures network architecture software design and other critical protective measures to protect customer account data as mandated by the credit card brands the failure to adhere to such standards could expose prescription solutions to liability or impact their ability to process credit card transactions 

  

in addition our pbm businesses would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to failure of technology or any other failure or disruption to these systems or to the infrastructure due to fire electrical outage natural disaster acts of terrorism or some other catastrophic event could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to customers 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate we compete with other companies on the basis of many factors including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives location and choice of health care providers quality of customer service comprehensiveness of coverage offered reputation for quality care financial stability and diversity of product offerings for our health benefits reporting segment competitors include aetna inc cigna corporation coventry health care inc health net inc humana inc kaiser permanente wellpoint inc numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare specialty services for our prescription solutions business competitors include medco health solutions inc cvscaremark corporation and express scripts inc our optumhealth and ingenix reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of other businesses 

in particular markets competitors may have greater capabilities resources or market share a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements existing business relationships or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals in these industries consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or to maintain or advance profitability if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect if membership or demand for other services declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

adverse economic conditions may continue to impact demand for certain of our products and services for example decreases in employment have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment in our employer group plans lower enrollment in our nonemployer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans adverse economic conditions have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition adverse economic conditions could continue to negatively impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could adversely affect our results of operations in addition a prolonged adverse economic environment could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings 

  

during a prolonged adverse economic environment state and federal budgets could be adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and chip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated andor received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in addition the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims and could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers our business could be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for competitive prices and services our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

in addition we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers under the typical arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member under some capitated arrangements the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us for example we are involved in litigation with outofnetwork providers that is described in more detail in “litigation matters” in note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the success of certain optumhealth businesses depends on maintaining physician relationships the primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our health services businesses given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract retain and provide support to a network of independent thirdparty brokers consultants and agents 

our products are sold in part through independent brokers consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business we typically do not have longterm contracts with our independent brokers consultants and agents who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend andor market health care products and services of our competitors as a result we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales would be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent brokers consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to them regarding our product portfolio or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 

because broker and agent commissions are included as health insurer administrative expenses under the medical loss ratio requirements of the health reform legislation these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other health insurer administrative costs our relationships with brokers and agents could be adversely impacted by changes in our businesses practices to address these pressures including potential reductions in commissions and changes in the treatment of consulting fees 

in addition there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care products and the payments they receive these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling these companies’ products for example cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans andor changes to industry practice which could adversely impact our ability to market our products 

our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

under our agreements with aarp we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance hospital indemnity insurance and other products to aarp members and medicare part d prescription drug plans to aarp members and nonmembers one of our agreements with aarp expands the relationship to include aarpbranded medicare advantage plans for aarp members and nonmembers our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance corporate social responsibility diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances including depending on the agreement a material breach by either party insolvency of either party a material adverse change in our financial condition material changes in the medicare programs material harm to aarp caused by us and by mutual agreement the success of our aarp arrangements depends in part on our ability to service aarp and its members develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively meet our corporate governance corporate social responsibility and diversity commitments and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

because of the nature of our business we are routinely subject to various litigation actions which if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties andor monetary damages and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

periodically we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions medical malpractice shareholder suits and intellectual propertyrelated litigation in addition because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings these matters include among others claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups 

we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters however it is possible that the level of actual losses will exceed the liabilities recorded 

a description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters therefore these legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2010 relatively low interest rates on investments such as those experienced during recent years have negatively impacted our investment income and a prolonged low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income in addition defaults by issuers primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds who fail to pay or perform on their obligations could reduce our net investment income as we may be required to write down the value of our investments which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders’ equity 

we also allocate a small proportion of our portfolio to equity investments which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments general economic conditions stock market conditions and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations illiquidity or otherwise could have a negative effect on our shareholders’ equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations shareholders’ equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected 

goodwill and other intangible assets were 257 billion as of december 31 2010 representing 41 of our total assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary for example the 

  

manner in or the extent to which the health reform legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in our business in addition from time to time we divest businesses as part of our business strategy and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could in turn negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 

largescale medical emergencies may result in significant medical costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

largescale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically for example in the event of a natural disaster bioterrorism attack pandemic or other extreme events we could face among other things significant medical costs and increased use of health care services any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended our business could be materially adversely affected 

our ability to adequately price our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer patterns if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products and these products may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

  

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations many of these subsidiaries are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions and could adversely affect our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle repurchase of shares of our common stock and repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our results of operations business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows for acquisitions success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our results of operations could be adversely affected 

downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will be maintained in the 

  

future our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

revenues 

our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from riskbased health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a oneyear period and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs we also generate revenues from feebased services performed for customers that selfinsure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependants for both riskbased and feebased health care benefit arrangements we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services transaction processing health care professional services and access to contracted networks of physicians hospitals and other health care professionals we also generate service revenues from ingenix health intelligence and consulting businesses product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our prescription solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of ingenix publishing and software products we derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold or otherthantemporarily impaired 

operating costs 

medical costs our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable care provider 

  

contracts and care coordination programs controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patientsconsumers health professionals hospitals pharmaceuticaltechnology manufacturers and other key stakeholders 

medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims and our estimates for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 

our medical care ratio calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues reflects the combination of pricing benefit designs consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts we seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business however changes in business mix such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio governmentsponsored public sector programs and recently enacted health reform legislation may impact our premiums medical costs and medical care ratio 

in 2011 we expect consumer usage of the health system to increase resuming its upward growth pattern from the recent moderation in utilization growth we will work to manage medical cost trends through affordable network relationships payforperformance reimbursement programs for care providers and targeted clinical initiatives around improving quality and affordability however an increase in utilization will likely result in increased medical costs and an increase in our medical care ratio 

operating costs operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits agent and broker commissions premium taxes and assessments professional fees advertising and occupancy costs we seek to improve our operating cost ratio calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues for an equivalent mix of business however changes in business mix such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio 

cash flows 

we generate cash primarily from premiums service and product revenues and investment income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs payments on debt purchases of investments acquisitions dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases for more information on our cash flows see “liquidity” below 

2011 business realignment 

on january 1 2011 we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves for example in 2011 optumhealth’s results of operations will include our clinical services assets including southwest medical multispecialty clinics in nevada and our evercare nurse practitioners serving the frail and elderly which had historically been reported in unitedhealthcare employer  individual and unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement respectively unitedhealthcare employer  individual’s results of operations will include optumhealth specialty benefits including dental vision life and disability there were no changes to our reportable segments as a result of these changes our periodic filings beginning with our first quarter 2011 form 10q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the us health economy which comprises approximately 18 of us gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years we expect overall spending on health care in 

  

the us to continue to rise in the future due to inflation medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement regulatory requirements demographic trends in the us population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and enacted health care reforms which could also impact our results of operations 

health care reforms in the first quarter of 2010 the health reform legislation was signed into law the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market the medicaid and medicare programs chip and other aspects of the health care system hhs the dol and the treasury department have issued regulations or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation but we await final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation all of which have a variety of effective dates 

we operate a diversified set of businesses that focus on health care and our business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors the health reform legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth in certain products and market segments restrict premium rate increases for certain products and market segments increase our medical and administrative costs or expose us to an increased risk of liability any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us we also anticipate that the health reform legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality as well as in prevention wellness and disease management we believe demand for many of our service offerings such as consulting services data management information technology and related infrastructure construction disease management and populationbased health and wellness programs will continue to grow 

beginning in 2011 health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products as calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and regulations that fall below certain targets 85 for large employer groups 80 for small employer groups and 80 for individuals will be required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually rebate payments if any for 2011 would be made in mid 2012 the potential for and size of the rebates will be measured at the market level by state and by licensed subsidiary this disaggregation of insurance pools into much smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in estimates of rebates owed in total in the aggregate the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained 

depending on the results of the calculation there is a broad range of potential rebate and other business impacts and there could be meaningful disruption in local health care markets if companies decide to adjust their offerings in response to these requirements for example companies could elect to change pricing modify product features or benefits adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market companies could also seek to adjust their operating costs to support reduced premiums by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on nonmedical product features and services companies continue to face a significant amount of uncertainty given the breadth of possible changes including changes in the competitive environment state rate approval fluctuations in medical costs the statistical variation that results from assessing business by state by license and by market and the potential for meaningful market disruption in 2011 and 2012 we have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to this legislation including reducing broker commissions and are evaluating changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment these changes could impact future growth in these products other market participants could also implement changes to their business practices in response to this legislation which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share 

the health reform legislation also requires hhs to maintain an annual review of “unreasonable” increases in premium rates for commercial health plans hhs recently proposed a regulation that defines a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10 and the proposed rule clarifies that the hhs review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes the proposed regulation further requires health plans to provide to the states and hhs extensive information supporting any rate increase of 10 or more the 

  

federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases and providing funding to assist in those statelevel reviews ultimately rate approval responsibility still lies with the states under the proposed regulation depending on the level of anticipated increased scrutiny by the states there is a broad range of potential business impacts for example it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends leading to the risk of operating margin compression 

effective in 2011 the health reform legislation mandates consumer discounts of 50 on brand name prescription drugs and 7 on generic prescription drugs for part d plan participants in the coverage gap this statutory reduction in drug prices for seniors in the coverage gap may cause people who may have had difficulty affording their medications to increase their pharmaceutical usage the change in pricing could also have secondary effects such as changing the mix of brand name and generic drug usage by seniors we have incorporated the anticipated impact of these changes in our 2011 product pricing and pharmacy benefit management business plan 

as part of the health reform legislation medicare advantage payment rates for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels separately cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of 16 for 2011 we expect the 2011 rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs beginning in 2012 additional cuts to medicare advantage plans will take effect plans will ultimately receive 95 of medicare feeforservice rates in high cost areas to 115 in low cost areas with changes being phasedin over two to six years depending on the level of payment reduction in a county all of these changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels there are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions for example we can adjust members’ benefits decide on a countybycounty basis which geographies to participate in and seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management additionally achieving high quality scores from cms for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses quality bonus payments may further offset these anticipated rate reductions as cms quality rating bonus payments are phased in over three years beginning in 2012 we also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the anticipated increase in the number of people eligible for medicare in coming years longer term market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of medicare advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our medicare part d and medicare supplement insurance offerings 

the health reform legislation presents additional opportunities and challenges over the longer term including the assessment of an annual 8 billion insurance industry assessment beginning in 2014 the operation of statebased exchanges for individuals and small businesses beginning in 2014 and numerous other commercial and governmental plan requirements individual states may also accelerate their procurement of medicaid managed care services for sizeable groups of medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads when medicaid market expansions take place in 2014 the law could increase nearterm business growth opportunities for unitedhealthcare community  state due to the complexity of the health care system and the numerous changes that are taking place the longer term effect of the new legislation remains difficult to assess 

court proceedings related to the health reform legislation such as the ruling by the united states district court for the northern district of florida in a case brought on behalf of 26 state attorneys general andor governors that declared the entire legislation unconstitutional and the potential for congressional action to impede implementation create additional uncertainties with respect to the law for additional information regarding the health reform legislation and the related risk factors see item 1 “business — government regulation” and item 1a “risk factors” 

adverse economic conditions the current us economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services for example decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our customers and have put pressure on our overall growth and 

  

operating profitability if the current economic environment continues for a prolonged period federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate andor impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments government funding pressure coupled with adverse economic conditions will impact the financial positions of hospitals physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses our revenues are also impacted by us monetary and fiscal policy in response to current economic conditions the us federal reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points for additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business see item 1a “risk factors” in part i

2010 results of operations compared to 2009 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

the increases in revenues for 2010 were primarily due to strong organic growth in riskbased benefit offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends growth in customers served by our health services businesses particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs increased revenues from public sector behavioral health programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth 

medical costs and medical care ratio 

medical costs for 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets riskbased businesses and medical cost inflation which were partially offset by net favorable development of prior period medical costs 

for 2010 and 2009 there was 800 million and 310 million respectively of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years the favorable development in 2010 was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels more efficient claims handling and processing which results in higher completion factors a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers and favorable resolution of certain statebased assessments 

the medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously 

operating costs 

operating costs for 2010 increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at ingenix which is discussed in more detail below an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the medicare advantage annual enrollment period costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation increased advertising costs and the absorption of new business development and startup costs 

income tax rate 

the increase in our effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the 2010 rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation related to the health reform legislation 

reporting segments 

we have four reporting segments 

 

  

  

  

   

see note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the types and services from which each of these reporting segments derives its revenues 

transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to health benefits customers by prescription solutions certain product offerings sold to health benefits customers by optumhealth and medical benefits cost quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to health benefits by ingenix these transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation 

the following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments 

 

  

nm  not meaningful 

the following summarizes the number of individuals served by our health benefits businesses by major market segment and funding arrangement at december 31 

 

   

health benefits 

the revenue growth in health benefits for 2010 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends partially offset by medicare advantage premium rate decreases in 2010 revenues were 412 billion for unitedhealthcare employer  individual 359 billion for unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and 104 billion for unitedhealthcare community  state in 2009 revenues were 408 billion for unitedhealthcare employer  individual 321 billion for unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and 84 billion for unitedhealthcare community  state 

health benefits earnings from operations and operating margins for 2010 increased over the prior year due to factors that increased revenues described above continued cost management disciplines on behalf of our commercial and governmental customers a general moderation in yearoveryear growth in demand for medical services and the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs 

optumhealth 

increased revenues in optumhealth for 2010 were driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets partially offset by a loss of some smaller specialty benefits customers 

the operating margin for 2010 decreased due to growth in lower margin public sector business new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the mental health parity act 

ingenix 

increased revenues in ingenix for 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance 

the decrease in operating margin for 2010 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3branded clinical trial service businesses in addition increases in the mix of lower margin business continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas also contributed to the decrease in operating margin in 2010 see note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment 

prescription solutions 

the increased prescription solutions revenues for 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement business and higher prescription volumes intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were 145 billion and 126 billion for 2010 and 2009 respectively 

prescription solutions operating margin for 2010 decreased due to changes in performancebased pricing contracts with medicare part d plan sponsors which were partially offset by prescription volume growth increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management 

2009 results of operations compared to 2008 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

consolidated revenues for 2009 increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the health benefits reporting segment the increase in premium revenues was primarily due to strong organic growth in 

  

riskbased offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs partially offset by a decline in the number of people served in the commercial market the effect of 2008 health benefits acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues during 2009 

medical costs 

medical costs for 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets riskbased businesses elevated medical costs due to the h1n1 influenza virus unemploymentrelated benefit continuation programs due to an increased level of national unemployment medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services 

for each period our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period are included in total medical costs reported for the current period for 2009 and 2008 medical costs included 310 million and 230 million respectively of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 

operating costs 

operating costs for 2009 decreased due to certain expenses incurred in 2008 as discussed below and disciplined operating cost management which were partially offset by increased costs due to acquired and organic business growth and from an increase in state insurance assessments levied against premiums a portion of which was in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate 

operating costs for 2008 included 882 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs 350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for outofnetwork medical services 50 million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and 46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items partially offset by a 185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual medicare advantage business in nevada in may 2008 

income tax rate 

our income tax rate for 2009 decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes 

reporting segments 

health benefits 

revenue growth in health benefits for 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products and a decrease in investment and other income driven by lower shortterm investment yields 2009 revenues were 408 billion for unitedhealthcare employer  individual 321 billion for unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and 84 billion for unitedhealthcare community  state 2008 revenues were 418 billion for unitedhealthcare employer  individual 281 billion for unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement and 60 billion for unitedhealthcare community  state 

the decrease in health benefits earnings from operations for 2009 was primarily due to a 166 million reduction in investment and other income and a decrease in commercial business partially offset by the growth in lower margin public and senior markets businesses health benefits’ operating margins decreased due to the factors that decreased earnings from operations 

  

optumhealth 

increased optumhealth revenues for 2009 were primarily driven by new business development in largescale public sector care and behavioral health programs for state clients which were partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products 

earnings from operations and operating margins for 2009 decreased due to the decrease in commercial membership described above startup costs for new large contracts and lower investment income partially offset by earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and disciplined operating cost management 

ingenix 

improvements in ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for 2009 were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business new internal service offerings and the effect of 2009 acquisitions the decreases in operating margins for 2009 were primarily due to investments in services offerings including outsourcing services for pharmaceutical customers and costs for international expansion hospital revenue cycle management and data privacy and security 

prescription solutions 

the increased prescription solutions revenues for 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our unitedhealthcare medicare  retirement business which is the largest customer of this reporting segment intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were 126 billion and 110 billion for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

prescription solutions earnings from operations for 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth strong success under performancebased purchasing arrangements gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short and longterm obligations of our businesses while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses the risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses geographies and customers our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our riskbased businesses and continued productivity improvements in our operating costs 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash cash equivalents and investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected shortterm obligations in longer term liquid investmentgrade debt securities to improve our overall investment return we make these investments pursuant to our board of directors’ approved investment policy which focuses on preservation of capital credit quality diversification income and duration the policy also generally governs return objectives regulatory limitations tax implications and risk tolerances 

our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the naic these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies except in 

  

the case of extraordinary dividends these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus these dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval if the dividend together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus the entire dividend is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval 

in 2010 based on the 2009 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was 32 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 32 billion including 686 million of extraordinary dividends for the year ended december 31 2009 our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 42 billion including 25 billion of extraordinary dividends the total dividends received in both 2010 and 2009 included all of the ordinary dividend capacity of 32 billion and 31 billion respectively in some cases ordinary dividends were classified as extraordinary dividends due to their increased size andor accelerated timing 

our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and longterm debt as well as the availability of our committed credit facility further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we generally use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures repay debt or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends andor repurchases of our common stock depending on market conditions 

results 

a summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below 

 

   

2010 cash flows compared to 2009 cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased 648 million or 12 for 2010 factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings an acceleration of certain 2011 premium payments and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections which were partially offset by a mandated acceleration in the claim payment cycle associated with the medicare part d program and payment for the settlement of the american medical association class action litigation related to reimbursement for outofnetwork medical services we anticipate lower cash flows from operations in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings and the early receipt of certain 2011 premium payments in late 2010 

cash flows used for investing activities increased 44 billion primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2010 decreases in sales of investments due to a more stable market environment and uses of operating cash to purchase investments 

cash flows used for financing activities decreased 664 million or 29 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and longterm debt partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid on our common stock 

2009 cash flows compared to 2008 cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased 14 billion or 33 primarily due to the payment in 2008 of 573 million net of taxes for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices the 2009 increase in medical costs payable driven by membership growth in riskbased products in the public and senior markets businesses and the effect of changes to our receivable and payable balances with cms related to medicare part d additionally we paid less taxes in 2009 due to tax law changes that took effect in 2008 operating cash flows in 2008 included payment of 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts 

cash flows used for investing activities decreased 41 billion or 81 primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments 

cash flows used for financing activities increased 17 billion due to the issuance of longterm debt in 2008 and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008 these items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2010 our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 257 billion included 91 billion of cash and cash equivalents of which 974 million was held by nonregulated entities 161 billion of debt securities and 516 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies primarily used in valuing our level 3 equity securities may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments due to the subjective nature of these assumptions the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program which is supported by our 25 billion bank credit facility reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our fair value measurements 

our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weightedaverage duration of 22 years and a weightedaverage credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2010 included in the debt securities balance are 27 billion of 

  

state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor neither indirect through the guarantees nor direct through investment in the guarantor further due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers the weightedaverage credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “aa” as of december 31 2010 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper we maintain a commercial paper program which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt through thirdparty brokerdealers the commercial paper program is supported by the 25 billion bank credit facility described below we had 930 million of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2010 our issuance of commercial paper in 2010 was to maintain ample liquidity at the holding company level 

bank credit facility  we have a 25 billion fiveyear revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks which matures in may 2012 this facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes we had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2010 the interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on libor plus a spread as of december 31 2010 the annual interest rate on this facility had it been drawn would have ranged from 05 to 07 

our bank credit facility contains various covenants including requiring us to maintain a debttototalcapital ratio below 50 our debttototalcapital ratio calculated as debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity was 301 and 321 as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of december 31 2010 

debt issuance  in october 2010 we issued 750 million in senior unsecured notes under our february 2008 s3 shelf registration statement the issuance included 450 million of 3875 fixedrate notes due october 2020 and 300 million of 5700 fixedrate notes due october 2040 we intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes 

credit ratings our credit ratings at december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

  

 the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital we have therefore adopted strategies and actions to maintain financial flexibility and mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital 

share repurchases under our board of directors’ authorization we maintain a common share repurchase program repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market subject to certain preset parameters in february 2010 the board renewed and increased our share repurchase program and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock in 2010 we repurchased 76 million shares at an average price of approximately 33 per share and an aggregate cost of 25 billion as of december 31 2010 we had board authorization to purchase up to an additional 48 million shares of our common stock 

  

debt tender in february 2010 we completed cash tender offers for 775 million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes we believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost we used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes 

dividends in may 2010 our board of directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders and moved us to a quarterly dividend payment cycle declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends are at the discretion of the board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change prior to may 2010 our policy had been to pay an annual dividend 

the following table provides details of our dividend payments 

 

 contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2010 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 

 

  

      

  we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations this includes internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2010 we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as that phrase is defined by sec rules applicable to this report which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

recently issued accounting standards 

we have determined that there have been no recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or apply to our operations 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs 

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption health care professional contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service we estimate liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions 

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs 

  

is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2010 2009 and 2008 included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of 800 million 310 million and 230 million respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36month period a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation for months prior to the most recent three months we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicatedtodate to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months for the most recent three months we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control this approach is consistently applied from period to period 

completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods generally periods prior to the most recent three months the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2010 

 

 medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31 2010 

 

 the analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2010 developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes 

  

the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2010 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2010 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance 2010 net earnings would increase or decrease by 51 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by 005 per share 

the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation these include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals we emphasize preventive health care appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards education and closing gaps in care 

we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful however other factors including competitive pressures new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers major epidemics and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation because of the narrow operating margins of our riskbased products changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 

revenues 

revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services as recorded in our records employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing we estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly our estimates are based on historical trends premiums billed the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information beginning in 2011 premium revenue subject to the medical loss ratio rebates of the health reform legislation will be recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract if that amount can be reasonably estimated the estimated premium will be revised each period to reflect current experience we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 

cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings we and other health care providers collect capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information regarding these audits 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount to determine whether 

  

goodwill is impaired we perform a twostep impairment test in the first step of the test the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would proceed to step two of the test in step two of the test the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess if any of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance 

we calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows to determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates where available and appropriate comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

we completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of january 1 2011 which considered our business realignment and determined that other than the 172 million impairment related to certain of ingenix’s businesses no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2010 although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units there is uncertainty inherent in those projections that uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in item 1 “business — government regulation” for additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms could affect our business see item 1a “risk factors” in part i 

intangible assets finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance eg membership lists customer contracts and trademarks we do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded 

we calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets we consider many factors including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows there were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year 

investments 

as of december 31 2010 we had investments with a carrying value of 168 billion primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses net of income tax effects as a separate component in shareholders’ equity we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2010 our investments had gross unrealized gains of 527 million and gross unrealized losses of 81 million we evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the 

  

security before recovery of the entire amortized cost for debt securities if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security we recognize the entire impairment in earnings if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss which is recognized in earnings and all other causes which are recognized in other comprehensive income for equity securities we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period if we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term we recognize the impairment in net earnings new information and the passage of time can change these judgments we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities mortgagebacked securities and corporate debt obligations substantially all of investment grade quality securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain after application of the valuation allowances we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 

according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits 

we have established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under us gaap we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems 

the significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year a hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on our 2010 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by 74 million 

contingent liabilities 

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel if appropriate and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage if any for such matters it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base as of december 31 2010 we had an aggregate 20 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005 we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery currently the reinsurer is rated by am best as “a” as of december 31 2010 there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate financial investments and debt and b changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 

as of december 31 2010 91 billion of our financial investments was classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also 71 billion of our debt as of december 31 2010 was at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2010 163 billion of our investments was fixedrate debt securities and 40 billion of our debt was fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts as part of our risk management strategy we enter into interest rate swap agreements with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense our swap agreements converted a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 or 2 as of december 31 2010 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our financial investments and debt in millions

 as of december 31 2010 we had 516 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds a portion of which were invested in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

government regulation 

most of our health and wellbeing services are regulated by federal and state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction federal and state governments continue to enact and consider 

  

various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system including proposals to address the affordability and availability of health insurance and to reduce the number of uninsured individuals the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically new laws regulations and rules or changes in the interpretation of existing laws regulations and rules could negatively affect our business we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws regulations and rules in the event we fail to comply with federal and state regulations or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to health care reforms and frequent changes in federal and state regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal and state government regulations 

federal laws and regulation

hipaa glba and other privacy and security regulation the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended hipaa apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets including selffunded employee benefit plans hipaa requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers and certain eligible individuals it also requires guaranteed renewability for employers and individuals and limits exclusions based on preexisting conditions federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information the hipaa privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us 

federal privacy and security requirements change frequently because of legislation regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation for example the us congress enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra which significantly amends and adds new privacy and security provisions to hipaa and imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information aara includes new contracting requirements for hipaa business associate agreements extends parts of hipaa privacy and security provisions to business associates adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to the department of health and human services hhs and the federal trade commission ftc and in some cases to the local media strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for hipaa violations and in certain cases imposes criminal penalties for individuals including employees in the conduct of our business we may act depending on the circumstances as either a covered entity or a business associate federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws including the grammleachbliley act glba or state statutes implementing glba which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with hipaa glba and other privacyrelated regulations 

  

erisa the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employersponsored health benefit plans erisa is a set of laws and regulations subject to periodic interpretation by the us department of labor dol as well as the federal courts erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans particularly those that maintain selffunded plans regulations established by the dol provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by erisa additionally some states require licensure or registration of companies providing thirdparty claims administration services for health care plans

state laws and regulation 

health care regulation our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate those products and operations these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements with the amendment of the annual financial reporting model regulation by the national association of insurance commissioners to adopt elements substantially similar to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we expect that these states will continue to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of hmos and insurance companies 

health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates these laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 

in addition some of our business and related activities may be subject to other health carerelated regulations and requirements including ppo managed care organization mco utilization review ur or thirdparty administratorrelated regulations and licensure requirements these regulations differ from state to state but may contain network contracting product and rate and financial and reporting requirements there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services payment of claims adequacy of health care professional networks fraud prevention protection of consumer health information pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services state health care antifraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members billing unnecessary medical services and improper marketing our americhoice and ovations medicaid businesses are subject to regulation by state medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits by americhoice to its medicaid and schip beneficiaries and by ovations to its medicaid beneficiaries we also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of state government contracts 

pharmacy regulation prescription solutions’ mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the state in which they are located our mail order pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances in many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and 

  

regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state our mail order pharmacies maintain certain medicare and state medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our pbm businesses 

privacy and security laws states have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the glba like hipaa glba allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection a number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices for example state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of social security numbers state and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information state consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers additionally different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacyrelated regulations 

udfi in addition the utah state department of financial institutions udfi has state regulatory and supervisory authority over optumhealth bank and in conjunction with federal regulators performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements in addition to such annual examinations the udfi in conjunction with federal regulators performs periodic examinations of the bank’s compliance with applicable state banking statutes regulations and agency guidelines in the event of unfavorable examination results the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses governmental oversight and monetary penalties 

commitments in connection with the pacificare health systems inc pacificare and sierra health services inc sierra acquisitions which closed in december 2005 and february 2008 respectively certain of our subsidiaries entered into various commitments with state regulatory departments principally in california and nevada many of the pacificare commitments in california expired on december 19 2009 we believe that none of the remaining commitments in any of the affected states will materially affect our operations 

audits and investigations 

we have been and are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments state attorneys general the office of the inspector general the office of personnel management the office of civil rights us congressional committees the us department of justice us attorneys the sec the internal revenue service the us department of labor and other governmental authorities such government actions can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs see note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for details in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and retain our current business 

international regulation 

some of our business units including ingenix’s i3 business have international operations these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions including various tax tariff and trade regulations as well as employment intellectual property privacy and investment rules and laws 

  

competition

proposed health care reforms could materially adversely affect our revenues financial position and our results of operations 

both houses of congress have recently passed bills relating to health care reform which have not yet been reconciled with each other and signed into law examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers imposing new and potentially significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits guaranteed coverage requirements elimination of preexisting condition exclusions or annual lifetime maximum limits restrictions on our ability to price products based on our underwriting standards or restructuring the medicare or medicaid programs including reducing payments to private plans offering medicare advantage over the intermediate term in addition from time to time congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which if adopted could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under erisa additionally there is legislative interest in modifying erisa’s preemptive effect on state laws if adopted such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations 

a number of state legislatures including california colorado new york ohio and pennsylvania have contemplated but have not enacted significant reform of their health insurance markets other states are expected to consider significant reform of their health insurance markets as well as more modest reforms aimed at expanding medicaid andor schip eligibility and new coverage options for those not eligible for government programs these proposals include provisions affecting both public programs and privately financed health insurance arrangements states also are considering proposals that would reform the underwriting and marketing practices of individual and group health insurance products by for example placing restrictions on rating and pricing and mandating minimum medical benefit cost ratios 

the enactment of health care reforms at the federal or state level may affect certain aspects of our business including contracting with physicians hospitals andor other health care professionals medical administrative technology or other costs physician reimbursement methods and payment rates premium rates coverage determinations mandated benefits minimum medical expenditures claim payments and processing drug utilization and patient safety efforts collection use disclosure maintenance and disposal of individually identifiable health information personal health records consumerdriven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms and governmentsponsored programs 

we cannot predict if any of these proposals will ultimately become law or if enacted what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years but if enacted could reduce our revenues increase our costs expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our results of operations our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes 

if we fail to effectively estimate price for and manage our medical costs the profitability of our riskbased products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results 

under our riskbased product arrangements we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased products comprise approximately 90 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our riskbased products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs 

we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically fixed for a 

  

12month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period however medical cost inflation regulation and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use as a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if medical costs increased by 1 without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products our annual net earnings for 2009 would have been reduced by approximately 200 million 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove too low they will have a negative impact on our future results 

our business activities are highly regulated new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change for example in 2009 cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of approximately 5 for 2010 although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis terminated benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the medicare advantage program our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such reductions 

the broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering regulations governing our business as well as future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions for example in october 2008 congress enacted the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 mhpaea which requires insurers to provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits under terms that are no more restrictive than those applied to medical and surgical benefits the mhpaea specifically directed the secretaries of labor health and human services and the treasury to issue regulations to effectuate the legislation although regulations regarding how the mhpaea will be implemented were issued on february 2 2010 in the form of an interim final rule final regulations have not yet been published because of the broad range of treatment limitations to which parity is expected to apply under the regulations the regulations will likely lead to an increase in the costs associated with both insured and selfinsured plans for behavioral health benefits and services and impact our market for carveout health benefit administration which could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations 

we must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions including integration of certain acquisitions delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 

in august 2007 we entered into a multistate national agreement with regulatory offices in 39 states and the district of columbia relating to unitedhealthcare’s fully insured commercial business administered on the 

  

organization’s main processing platforms the agreement covers several key areas of review of our business operations including claims payment accuracy and timeliness appeals and grievances resolution timeliness health care professional networkservice utilization review explanation of benefits accuracy and oversight and due diligence of contracted entities and vendor performance the agreement addressed and resolved past regulatory matters related to the areas of review prior to august 2007 and establishes a transparent framework for evaluating and regulating performance through december 2010 the agreement is similar to a customer performance guarantee whereby we self report quarterly and annually our current operational performance on a set of national performance standards agreed to by the participating states we must perform to the standards set forth in the agreement or be subject to fines and penalties 

we are also involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these regulatory activities include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general the office of the inspector general the office of personnel management the office of civil rights us congressional committees the us department of justice us attorneys the sec the irs the us department of labor and other governmental authorities for example in 2007 the california department of insurance examined our pacificare health insurance plan in california the examination findings related to claims processing accuracy and timeliness accurate and timely interest payments timely implementation of provider contracts timely accurate provider dispute resolution and other related matters the matter is now the subject of an administrative proceeding before an administrative law judge in addition the us department of labor is conducting an investigation of our administration of our employee benefit plans with respect to erisa compliance reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions which can result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in addition the health care industry is subject to negative publicity negative publicity including negative publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price damage our reputation in various markets and result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services requiring us to change our products and services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our businesses see item 1 “business – government regulation” 

adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

the current recessionary us economic environment may continue to impact demand for certain of our products and services for example higher unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings have caused and could continue to lead to lower enrollment in our employer group plans lower enrollment in our nonemployer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans adverse economic conditions have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition the economic downturn could continue to negatively impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could adversely affect our results of operations in addition a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers and therefore could adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs 

  

during a prolonged economic downturn state and federal budgets could be adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and schip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated andor received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in addition the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pbm industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products 

we provide pbm services through our prescription solutions and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers customers and consumers in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies see item 1 “business – government regulation” for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our pbm businesses 

our pbm businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pbm businesses even where our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pbm businesses in connection with services for which our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions 

prescription solutions also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose prescription solutions to civil and criminal penalties further prescription solutions is subject to the payment card industry data security standards which is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management policies procedures network architecture software design and other critical protective measures to protect customer account data as mandated by the credit card brands the failure to adhere to such standards could expose prescription solutions to liability or impact their ability to process credit card transactions 

in addition our pbm businesses would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products disruptions at any of our mail order pharmacies due to failure of technology or any other failure or disruption to these systems or to the infrastructure due to fire electrical outage natural disaster acts of terrorism or some other catastrophic event could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to customers 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate we compete with other companies on the basis of many factors including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives location and choice of health care providers quality of customer service 

  

comprehensiveness of coverage offered reputation for quality care financial stability and diversity of product offerings for our health benefits reporting segment competitors include aetna inc cigna corporation coventry health care inc health net inc humana inc kaiser permanente wellpoint inc numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare specialty services for our prescription solutions business competitors include medco health solutions inc cvscaremark corporation and express scripts inc our optumhealth and ingenix reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of other businesses 

we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors in particular markets competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage greater market share established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements existing business relationships and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors 

in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals in these industries consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or to maintain or advance profitability if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect if membership or demand for other services declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

as a payer in various government health care programs we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments and audits that could adversely affect our revenues cash flows and results of operations 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care coverage programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs and schip and receive revenues from these programs these programs generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs for example cms recently implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of approximately 5 for 2010 such changes have adversely affected our results of operations and willingness to participate in such programs in certain geographic areas in the past and may do so in the future 

our participation in the medicare advantage medicare part d and various medicaid programs and schip occurs through bids that are submitted periodically revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including determining payments by considering the risk status of our medicare members as supported by provider medical record documentation federal regulators audit the supporting documents and can revise payments based on the audit findings cms announced in 2008 that it will perform audits of selected medicare health plans each year to 

  

validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by care providers these audits involve a review of medical records maintained by providers including those in and out of network and may result in prospective and retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans pursuant to cms medicare contracts certain of our plans have been selected for audit the first audits focused on medical records supporting risk adjustment data for 2006 that were used to determine 2007 payment amounts the office of inspector general for hhs is conducting an audit of our risk adjustment data for two plans we are unable to predict the outcome of the audits however any material adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 

our ability to retain and acquire medicare medicaid and schip enrollees is impacted by bids and plan designs submitted by our competitors and us under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold which is set by the government after our bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and we will not have additional members autoassigned to us for example we lost approximately 650000 of our autoenrolled lowincome subsidy members in 2008 because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect or our competitors’ bids and positioning are different than anticipated either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or otherwise our results of operations could be materially affected 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers our business could be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for competitive prices and services our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

in addition we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers under the typical arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member under some capitated arrangements the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with 

  

whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in addition some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding with the provider about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us for example we are involved in litigation with outofnetwork providers that is described in more detail in “legal matters” in note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with outofnetwork health care providers could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract retain and provide support to a network of independent third party brokers consultants and agents 

our products are sold in part through independent brokers consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business we typically do not have longterm contracts with our independent brokers consultants and agents who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend andor market health care products and services of our competitors as a result we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales would be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent brokers consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to them regarding our product portfolio which is complex or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 

in addition there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care products and the payments they receive these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling these companies’ products for example cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans andor changes to industry practice which could adversely impact our ability to market our products 

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and data security regulations including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality and security our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal glba and in hipaa hipaa now requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements see item 1 “business – government regulation” for a discussion of various federal and state privacy laws and regulations governing our businesses 

even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates and in certain cases assess our business associates’ security controls we still have limited control over their actions and 

  

practices privacy and security requirements regarding personally identifiable information are also imposed on us through controls with our customers in addition despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism or theft computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events compliance with new privacy and security laws requirements and new regulations such as arra will result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes including further implementation of encryption and other data protection standards new limitations or constraints on our business models the development of new administrative processes the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates and increased enforcement actions and fines and penalties they also may impose further restrictions on our collection disclosure and use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 

noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations including mandatory disclosure to the media significant increase in the number and cost of managing and remediating data security incidents increased enforcement actions material fines and penalties compensatory special punitive and statutory damages litigation consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

under our agreements with aarp we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance hospital indemnity insurance and other products to aarp members and medicare part d prescription drug plans to aarp members and nonmembers one of our agreements with aarp expands the relationship to include aarpbranded medicare advantage plans for aarp members and nonmembers our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance corporate social responsibility diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances including depending on the agreement a material breach by either party insolvency of either party a material adverse change in the financial condition of the company material changes in the medicare programs material harm to aarp caused by the company and by mutual agreement the success of our aarp arrangements depends in part on our ability to service aarp and its members develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively meet our corporate governance corporate social responsibility and diversity commitments and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

because of the nature of our business we are routinely subject to various litigation actions which if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties andor monetary damages and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

periodically we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims shareholder suits and intellectual propertyrelated litigation in addition because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings these matters include among others claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals tort contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups 

we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive 

  

damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters however it is possible that the level of actual losses will exceed the liabilities recorded 

a description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters therefore these legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december 31 2009 in addition defaults by issuers primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds who fail to pay or perform on their obligations could reduce our investment income and net realized investment gains or result in net realized investment losses as we may be required to write down the value of our investments which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders’ equity 

we also invest a small proportion of our investments in equity investments which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments general economic conditions stock market conditions and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations illiquidity or otherwise could have a negative effect on our shareholders’ equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations shareholders’ equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected 

goodwill and other intangible assets were 231 billion as of december 31 2009 representing 39 of our total assets we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary for example the enactment of health care reforms may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in some of our businesses as any passed legislation may significantly change the growth rate assumptions for some of our businesses any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could in turn negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 

largescale medical emergencies may result in significant medical costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

largescale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically for example in the event of a natural disaster bioterrorism attack pandemic or other extreme events we could face among other things significant medical costs and increased use of health care services any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems our business could be materially adversely affected 

our ability to adequately price our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been taking steps to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer patterns if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock and our ability to repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

  

any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our results of operations business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows for acquisitions success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our results of operations could be adversely affected 

downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and credit ratings by recognized rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

executive overview 

general 

unitedhealth group is a diversified health and wellbeing company serving more than 70 million americans our focus is on improving the overall health and wellbeing of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system we work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care we help people get the care they need at an affordable cost support the physicianpatient relationship and empower people with the information guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions 

through our diversified family of businesses we leverage core competencies in advanced technologybased transactional capabilities health care data knowledge and information and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better these core competencies are focused in two market areas health benefits and health services health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our unitedhealthcare ovations and americhoice businesses health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our optumhealth ingenix and prescription solutions businesses in aggregate these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and wellbeing access affordability quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market 

revenues 

our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from riskbased health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed typically for a oneyear period and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs we also generate revenues from services performed for customers that selfinsure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependants for both riskbased and feebased health care benefit arrangements we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services transaction processing health care professional services and access to contracted networks of physicians hospitals and other health care professionals we also generate service revenues from ingenix health intelligence and contract research businesses product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our prescription solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of ingenix publishing and software products we derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold or otherthantemporarily impaired 

operating costs 

medical costs our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patientsconsumers health professionals hospitals pharmaceuticaltechnology manufacturers and other key stakeholders 

  

medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 

our medical care ratio calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues reflects the combination of pricing benefit designs consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts we seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business however changes in business mix such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio governmentsponsored public sector programs will change the dynamics of our results 

operating costs operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits agent and broker commissions premium taxes and assessments professional fees advertising and occupancy costs 

cash flows 

we generate cash primarily from premiums service revenues and investment income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims purchases of investments common stock repurchases and payments on longterm debt for more information on our cash flows see “liquidity” below 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the us health economy which comprises approximately 17 of us gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years we expect overall spending on health care in the us to continue to rise in the future based on inflation demographic trends in the us population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and proposed health care reforms which could also impact our results of operations 

adverse economic conditions the current us recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services for example decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers putting pressure on top line growth for our unitedhealthcare and optumhealth businesses this workplace attrition contributed more than half of the 7 decrease in unitedhealthcare’s commercial membership during 2009 and this attrition trend is expected to continue at a generally elevated level until national employment stabilizes in contrast our americhoice business is experiencing growth in its state medicaid offerings as employment rates fall if the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate andor impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments our revenues are also impacted by us monetary and fiscal policy in response to recessionary conditions the us federal reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points changes in federal monetary policy have reduced the level of investment income received on our portfolio on a yearoveryear basis 

in total we believe that economic recessions will slow our revenue growth rate and could impact our operating profitability we also believe that government funding pressure coupled with recessionary economic conditions will impact the financial positions of hospitals physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses for additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business see item 1a “risk factors” 

  

american recovery and reinvestment act our businesses may benefit from elements of the federal economic stimulus package that was enacted in response to the current recession these elements include expansion of funding to state programs which could mitigate funding pressure for americhoice medicaid offerings at the state level and funding for health care information technology which could expand market opportunities for ingenix 

proposed health care reforms and reimbursement changes both houses of congress have recently passed bills relating to health care reform which have not yet been reconciled with each other and signed into law examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers imposing new and potentially significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits guaranteed coverage requirements elimination of preexisting condition exclusions or annual lifetime maximum limits restrictions on our ability to price products based on our underwriting standards or restructuring the medicare or medicaid programs including reducing payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering medicare advantage we cannot predict if any of these proposals will ultimately become law or if enacted what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years but if enacted could reduce our revenues increase our costs expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our operating results our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes 

the administration and various congressional leaders have advanced proposals to reduce payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering medicare advantage further centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of approximately 5 for 2010 although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis terminated benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the medicare advantage program our operating results financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by these reductions if industrywide medicare advantage membership declines there is likely to be increased demand for medicare supplemental insurance and part d prescription drug coverage and in both categories ovations is a market leader 

we operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors therefore we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for our various products and services depending on the scope shape and timing of health care reforms it is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid to longterm time horizon for discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms see item 1a “risk factors”

2009 results of operations compared to 2008 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

consolidated revenues for 2009 increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the health benefits reporting segment the increase in premium revenues was primarily due to strong organic growth in riskbased offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs partially offset by a decline in the number of people served in the commercial market the effect of 2008 health benefits acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues during 2009 

medical costs 

medical costs for 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets riskbased businesses elevated medical costs due to the h1n1 influenza virus unemploymentrelated benefit continuation programs due to an increased level of national unemployment medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services 

for each period our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period are included in total medical costs reported for the current period for 2009 and 2008 medical costs included 310 million and 230 million respectively of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 

operating costs 

operating costs for 2009 decreased due to certain expenses incurred in 2008 as discussed below and disciplined operating cost management which were partially offset by increased costs due to acquired and organic business growth and from an increase in state insurance assessments levied against premiums a portion of which was in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate 

  

operating costs for 2008 included 882 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs 350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for outofnetwork medical services 50 million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and 46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items partially offset by a 185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual medicare advantage business in nevada in may 2008 

income tax rate 

our income tax rate for 2009 decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes 

reporting segments 

we have four reporting segments 

 

  

  

  

 transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to health benefits customers by prescription solutions certain product offerings sold to health benefits customers by optumhealth and consulting and other services sold to health benefits by ingenix these transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation 

  

the following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments 

 

  

nm  not meaningful 

the following summarizes the number of individuals served by our health benefits segment by major market segment and funding arrangement at december 31 

 

   

health benefits 

revenue growth in health benefits for 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products and a decrease in investment and other income driven by lower shortterm investment yields unitedhealthcare revenues of 408 billion for 2009 decreased by 10 billion or 2 compared to 2008 as the reduction in individuals served was partially offset by premium rate increases ovations revenues of 321 billion for 2009 increased by 41 billion or 15 over 2008 primarily due to an increase in individuals served through medicare part d medicare advantage and standardized medicare supplement offerings as well as premium rate increases americhoice generated revenues of 84 billion for 2009 an increase of 24 billion or 40 over the comparable 2008 period primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by medicaid plans and premium rate increases as well as the full year impact from the mid2008 unison acquisition 

the decrease in health benefits earnings from operations for 2009 was primarily due to a 166 million reduction in investment and other income and a decrease in commercial business partially offset by the growth in lower margin public and senior markets businesses the 2009 unitedhealthcare medical care ratio increased to 840 from 835 in 2008 largely due to elevated medical costs related to the h1n1 influenza virus and a higher proportion of participants receiving care under unemploymentrelated benefit continuation programs health benefits’ operating margins decreased due to the factors that decreased earnings from operations 

optumhealth 

increased optumhealth revenues for 2009 were primarily driven by new business development in largescale public sector care and behavioral health programs for state clients which were partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products as of december 31 2009 and 2008 optumhealth provided services to approximately 58 million and 60 million consumers respectively 

earnings from operations and operating margins for 2009 decreased due to the decrease in commercial membership described above startup costs for new large contracts and lower investment income partially offset by earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and disciplined operating cost management 

ingenix 

improvements in ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for 2009 were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business new internal service offerings and the effect of 2009 acquisitions the decreases in operating margins for 2009 were primarily due to investments in services offerings including outsourcing services for pharmaceutical customers and costs for international expansion hospital revenue cycle management and data privacy and security 

prescription solutions 

the increased prescription solutions revenues for 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our ovations business which is the largest customer of this reporting segment intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were 126 billion and 110 billion for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

prescription solutions earnings from operations for 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth strong success under performancebased purchasing arrangements gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals 

  

2008 results compared to 2007 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

consolidated revenues for 2008 increased from 2007 primarily due to the increase in premium revenue in the health benefits reporting segment the premium revenue growth generated by our health benefits reporting segment was the primary driver in the consolidated premium revenues increase this increase was due to the growth in individuals served by public and senior markets businesses premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and acquisitions completed in 2008 partially offset by a decline in individuals served through both unitedhealthcare riskbased products and medicare part d prescription drug plans 

investment and other income the decrease in investment and other income in 2008 was primarily due to lower investment yields primarily because of the decrease in interest rates on our cash equivalents decreased average investment balances related to lower operating cash flows decreased deposits held for certain governmentsponsored programs and increased otherthantemporary impairment charges related to the disruption in the financial markets 

medical costs 

medical costs for 2008 increased primarily due to medical cost inflation acquisitions completed in 2008 and growth in ovations medicare advantage and medicare supplement products partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through both unitedhealthcare riskbased products and medicare part d prescription drug plans for 2008 and 2007 medical costs included 230 million and 420 million respectively of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 

operating costs 

the operating cost ratio increased in 2008 primarily due to certain expenses as described in “2009 results of operations compared to 2008 results” above acquisitions completed in 2008 costs for anticipated revenue growth that did not fully materialize and a change in business mix towards service revenues from feebased businesses 

operating costs for 2007 include 176 million of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under section 409a of the internal revenue code section 409a to our historical stock option practices the 176 million section 409a charge includes 87 million of expenses for the payment of certain optionholders’ tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and 89 million of expenses for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments for an expanded discussion of our section 409a charges see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

depreciation and amortization 

the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology development and enhancements as well as additional depreciation and amortization related to business acquisitions 

income tax rate 

the decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings resulting in an increased proportion of taxfree investment income to total earnings 

  

reporting segments 

health benefits 

the revenue growth in health benefits for 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets group premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and the 2008 acquisitions of sierra fiserv health and unison partially offset by an organic decline in individuals served through commercial riskbased products and medicare part d products and a decrease in investment income unitedhealthcare revenues of 418 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by 16 billion or 4 the unitedhealthcare increase was primarily driven by the same factors as discussed for health benefits in 2008 ovations revenues of 281 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by 16 billion or 6 the increase was primarily due to an increase in individuals served with the standardized medicare supplement and medicare advantage products gained through both organic growth and the sierra acquisition and premium rate increases which were partially offset by a net organic decrease of 675000 standalone medicare part d members primarily due to the reassignment by cms of certain dualeligible low income beneficiaries based on annual price bids americhoice generated revenues of 60 billion in 2008 an increase of 15 billion or 34 over the comparable 2007 period primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by medicaid plans premium rate increases and the acquisition of unison in the second quarter of 2008 

the decrease in health benefits earnings from operations was primarily due to pressure on enrollment and gross margins in the unitedhealthcare riskbased business and pressure on gross margins in medicare part d prescription drug plans partially offset by acquisitions the unitedhealthcare medical care ratio increased to 835 in 2008 from 826 in 2007 this increase was primarily driven by the effects of a competitive pricing environment where price increases net of customer benefit package changes did not fully match the rise in medical costs and an increased mix of national account pharmaceutical benefit business which typically carries a higher medical care ratio health benefits’ operating margin was 67 for the year ended december 31 2008 a decrease from 93 in 2007 primarily driven by the factors discussed above 

the number of individuals served with commercial products increased due to acquisitions which included the addition of 1315000 feebased members from fiserv health and the addition of 310000 riskbased individuals gained through the sierra acquisition these additions were partially offset by a net decline in individuals served with commercial products of 805000 or 3 from december 31 2007 primarily due to a decline in individuals served with commercial riskbased products and the impact of a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment the number of individuals served by medicare advantage products at december 31 2008 increased through the addition of 60000 seniors from our acquisition of sierra and organic growth of 95000 seniors partially offset by the divestiture of 30000 individuals in nevada related to the sierra acquisition medicaid enrollment grew due to the addition of 320000 and 60000 individuals from our unison and sierra acquisitions respectively and strong organic growth of 425000 individuals 

optumhealth 

increased revenues in optumhealth were driven by rate increases for medical cost inflation and an increased number of consumers served by this segment optumhealth provided services to approximately 60 million consumers at december 31 2008 an increase of approximately 1 million individuals yearoveryear 

earnings from operations and operating margin decreased due to the increased costs for riskbased behavioral and specialty benefits businesses and the mix of continued growth in lower margin business 

ingenix 

the improvement in ingenix revenues was due to continued growth in its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions the decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to excess staffing costs during 2008 for certain research projects which were cancelled as well as lower demand for certain consulting services due to the current economic environment 

  

prescription solutions 

the decreased prescription solutions revenues were primarily due to the reduction in the number of individuals served related to the reassignment of dualeligible beneficiaries described above through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our ovations business and a shift from name brand pharmaceuticals towards generic utilization partially offset by revenues related to the fiserv health acquisition and growth in business with unaffiliated clients intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were 110 billion and 124 billion for 2008 and 2007 respectively 

prescription solutions earnings from operations increased primarily due to the fiserv health acquisition gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity 

introduction 

we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy we continually forecast and manage our cash investments working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short and longterm obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before depreciation amortization and other noncash expenses as a result any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity the diversity of our businesses our geographic and customer diversity and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our riskbased businesses which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected medical costs partially mitigates the risk of rising medical and operating costs 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash cash equivalents and investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected shortterm obligations in longer term investmentgrade marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return we make these investments pursuant to our board of directors’ approved investment policy which focuses on preservation of capital credit quality diversification income and duration the policy also generally governs return objectives regulatory limitations tax implications and risk tolerances 

our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the national association of insurance commissioners these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies except in the case of extraordinary dividends these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus these dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval if the dividend together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval 

in 2009 based on the 2008 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid was 31 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 42 billion including 25 billion of extraordinary dividends for the year ended december 31 2008 our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of 42 billion including 12 billion of extraordinary dividends the increase in the proportion of extraordinary dividends to total dividends in 2009 primarily reflects the acceleration of dividend timing as well as the size of specific dividends beyond ordinary levels given expected statutory capital levels we anticipate lower overall regulated subsidiary dividends in 2010 

  

our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and longterm debt as well as the availability of our committed credit facility further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures expanding our services through business acquisitions repaying debt andor repurchasing shares of our common stock depending on market conditions 

results 

a summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below 

 

 2009 cash flows compared to 2008 cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased 14 billion or 33 primarily due to the payment in 2008 of 573 million net of taxes for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices the 2009 increase in medical costs payable driven by membership growth in riskbased products in the public and senior markets businesses and the effect of changes to our receivable and payable balances with cms related to medicare part d additionally we paid less taxes in 2009 due to tax law changes that took effect in 2008 operating cash flows in 2008 included payment of 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts we anticipate lower cash flows from operations in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings the timing of certain cms payments and the impact of a legislated change to the timing of payments for medicare part d claims 

cash flows used for investing activities decreased 41 billion or 81 primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments 

cash flows used for financing activities increased 17 billion due to the issuance of longterm debt in 2008 and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008 see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our policy on offsetting cash balances these items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts 

  

2008 cash flows compared to 2007 cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities decreased 16 billion or 28 primarily due to the decrease in net earnings which included payments for the settlement of two class action lawsuits described above 

cash flows used for investing activities increased 925 million or 22 primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and increases in the usage of cash in 2008 for purchases of investments offset by the 2008 decreases in sales and maturities of investments 

cash flows used for financing activities decreased 26 billion or 81 primarily due to decreases in common stock repurchases in 2008 offset by the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2009 our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 242 billion included 98 billion of cash and cash equivalents which included 23 billion held by nonregulated entities 138 billion of debt securities and 577 million of equity securities and venture capital funds given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies primarily used in valuing our level 3 equity securities may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments due to the subjective nature of these assumptions the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets see note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our fair value measurements 

our investment portfolio has a weighted average duration of 21 years and a weighted average credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2009 included in the debt securities balance were 30 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties a number of different guarantors guarantee the securities and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor neither indirect through the guarantees nor direct through investment in the guarantor further due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “aa” as of december 31 2009 

capital resources and uses of liquidity 

in addition to cash flow from operations and significant cash and cash equivalent balances at our regulated and unregulated entities our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows 

commercial paper we maintain a commercial paper program which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities of up to 270 days through thirdparty brokerdealers the commercial paper program is supported by the 25 billion bank credit facility described below we did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2009 

bank credit facility  we have a fiveyear revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks which matures in may 2012 this facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes we had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2009 the interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread as of december 31 2009 the interest rate on this facility had it been drawn would have ranged from 04 to 07 

our bank credit facility contains various covenants the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain a debttototalcapital ratio below 50 our debttototalcapital ratio calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper debt and shareholders’ equity was 321 and 381 as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively we complied with the requirements of all debt covenants as of december 31 2009 

  

shelf registration in february 2008 we filed a universal s3 shelf registration statement with the sec registering an unspecified amount of debt securities 

credit ratings our credit ratings at december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

 the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital we have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital 

debt tender in february 2010 we completed cash tender offers for 775 million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes we believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost we used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes 

share repurchases under our board of directors’ authorization we maintain a common share repurchase program repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market in 2009 we repurchased 743 million shares at an average price of approximately 24 per share and an aggregate cost of 18 billion as of december 31 2009 we had board of directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 287 million shares of our common stock in february 2010 the board renewed and increased our share repurchase program and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2009 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 

 

  

     

    we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations this includes internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2009 we were not involved in any spe transactions 

recently issued accounting standards 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 200913 “multipledeliverable revenue arrangements” asu 200913 this update removes the criterion that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables and provides entities with a hierarchy of evidence that must be considered when allocating arrangement consideration the new guidance also requires entities to allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the deliverables’ relative selling price the provisions will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year 2011 and must be applied prospectively we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of asu 200913 

we have determined that all other recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not apply to our operations 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs 

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but 

  

not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption health care professional contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service we estimate liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development medical costs in 2009 2008 and 2007 included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of 310 million 230 million and 420 million respectively 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36month period a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation for months prior to the most recent three months we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicatedtodate to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months for the most recent three months we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control this approach is consistently applied from period to period 

completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods generally periods prior to the most recent three months the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2009 

 

   

medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31 2009 

 

 the analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2009 developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2009 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2009 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance 2009 net earnings would increase or decrease by 52 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by 004 per share 

the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation these include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals we emphasize preventive health care appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards education and closing gaps in care 

we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful however other factors including competitive pressures new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers major epidemics and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation because of the narrow operating margins of our riskbased products changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 

revenues 

revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services as recorded in our records employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing we estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly our estimates are based on historical trends premiums billed the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 

  

cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings we and other health care providers collect capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount to determine whether goodwill is impaired we perform a twostep impairment test in the first step of the test the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would proceed to step two of the test in step two of the test the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess if any of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance 

we calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows to determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations capital requirements and income taxes longterm growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates where available and appropriate comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 

we completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of january 1 2010 and determined that no impairment existed as of december 31 2009 although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units there is uncertainty inherent in those projections that uncertainty is increased by potential health care reforms as discussed in “proposed health care reforms and reimbursement changes” above as any passed legislation may significantly change the forecasts and longterm growth rate assumptions for some or all of our reporting units 

intangible assets finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance eg customer lists and trademarks we do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded 

we calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets we consider many factors including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows there were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year 

  

investments 

as of december 31 2009 we had investments with a carrying value of 146 billion primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses net of income tax effects as a separate component in shareholders’ equity we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2009 our investments had gross unrealized gains of 493 million and gross unrealized losses of 50 million we evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost for debt securities if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security we recognize the entire impairment in earnings if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss which is recognized in earnings and all other causes which are recognized in other comprehensive income for equity securities we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period if we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term we recognize the impairment in net earnings new information and the passage of time can change these judgments we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities mortgagebacked securities and corporate debt obligations substantially all of investment grade quality securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain after application of the valuation allowances we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 

according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits 

we have established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under us gaap we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems 

  

the significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year a hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on our 2009 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by 58 million 

contingent liabilities 

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel if appropriate and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage if any for such matters it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is included in note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base as of december 31 2009 we had an aggregate 20 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005 we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery currently the reinsurer is rated by am best as “a” as of december 31 2009 there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate financial investments and debt and b changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 

as of december 31 2009 98 billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also 750 million of our debt as of december 31 2009 was at interest rates that vary with market rates 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2009 140 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and 104 billion of our debt was fixedrate term debt an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time in normal markets either directly or through the use of interest rate swap 

  

contracts as part of our risk management strategy we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense in january 2009 we terminated interest rate swap contracts with 49 billion in notional value to lockin the benefit of low market interest rates this gain will be realized over the remaining life of the applicable hedged fixedrate debt as a reduction to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

the following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1 or 2 as of december 31 2009 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our financial investments and debt in millions 

 

  

nm  not meaningful 

 

 as of december 31 2009 we had 577 million of equity securities and venture capital funds a portion of which were invested in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2009 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework  based on our assessment and those criteria we believe that as of december 31 2009 the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 as stated in the report of independent registered public accounting firm appearing under item 9a which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2009

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and stockholders of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 of the company and our reports dated february 10 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

government regulation 

most of our health and wellbeing services are regulated by federal and state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction federal and state governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system including proposals to address the affordability and availability of health insurance and to reduce the number of uninsured individuals the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically new laws regulations and rules or changes in the interpretation of existing laws regulations and rules could negatively impact our business we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws regulations and rules in the event we fail to comply with federal and state regulations or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to health care reforms and frequent changes in federal and state regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal and state government regulations

promulgated pursuant to hipaa include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information the hipaa privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us 

federal privacy and security requirements change frequently as a result of legislation regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation the us congress is currently considering new privacy and security legislation some of the proposed changes include new contracting requirements for hipaa business associate agreements new agreements for covered entities’ logging disclosures for treatment payment and health care operations hipaa business associates being subject to most parts of the hipaa security rule and certain limitations on receiving direct or indirect remuneration for the exchange of health information federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws including the grammleachbliley act glba or state statutes implementing glba which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with hipaa glba and other privacyrelated regulations

state laws and regulation 

health care regulation our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate those products and operations these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements with the amendment of the annual financial reporting model regulation by the national association of insurance commissioners to incorporate elements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we expect that these states will continue to expand the regulations of corporate governance and internal control activities of hmos and insurance companies 

health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates these laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends

privacy and security laws states have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the glba like hipaa glba allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection a number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices for example state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of social security numbers state and local authorities are increasingly focused on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information state consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information additionally different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacyrelated regulations

commitments in connection with the pacificare health systems inc pacificare and sierra health services inc sierra acquisitions which closed in december 2005 and february 2008 respectively as typically occurs in connection with comparable sized transactions certain of our subsidiaries entered into various commitments with state regulatory departments principally in california and nevada we believe that none of these commitments will materially affect our operations 

  

audits and investigations 

we have been and are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments state attorneys general the office of the inspector general the office of personnel management the office of civil rights us congressional committees the us department of justice us attorneys the sec the internal revenue service and other governmental authorities such government actions can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs see note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for details in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and retain our current business 

international regulation 

some of our business units including ingenix’s i3 business have international operations these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions including various tax tariff and trade regulations as well as employment intellectual property privacy and investment rules and laws

 item 1a risk factors tableend cautionary statements 

the statements estimates projections guidance or outlook contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the sec in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words or phrases “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “plan” project” “should” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements 

the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider we do not undertake to address or update forwardlooking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate 

  

assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications 

if we fail to effectively estimate price for and manage our health care costs the profitability of our riskbased products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results 

under our riskbased product arrangements we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased products comprise approximately 90 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our riskbased products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage health care costs 

we manage health care costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically fixed for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed contract period however medical cost inflation regulation and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if medical costs increased by 1 without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products our annual net earnings for 2008 would have been reduced by approximately 200 million 

in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimates prove too low they will have a negative impact on our future results 

if we fail to comply with federal and state regulations or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to health care reforms and frequent changes in federal and state regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change the broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering those regulations as well as future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions see item 1 “business – government regulation” for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our businesses 

we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions including integration of certain acquisitions delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 

legislative proposals that would reform the health care system have been advanced by congress and state legislatures and are currently pending at the state and federal levels these changes include policy changes that 

  

would fundamentally change the dynamics of our industry such as having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care industry or a fundamental restructuring of the medicare or medicaid programs these proposals may also affect certain aspects of our business including contracting with physicians hospitals andor other health care professionals physician reimbursement methods and payment rates coverage determinations mandated benefits minimum medical expenditures claim payments and processing drug utilization and patient safety efforts collection use disclosure maintenance and disposal of individually identifiable health information personal health records consumerdriven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms and governmentsponsored programs 

for example the new administration and various congressional leaders have signaled their interest in reducing payments to private plans offering medicare advantage depending on the extent and phasing of these potential reductions the number of seniors participating in medicare advantage and the industrywide earnings derived from these plans may fall in addition massachusetts has enacted comprehensive reform including an individual health coverage mandate coupled with an employer mandate and a new state connector authority a number of other state legislatures including california colorado new york ohio and pennsylvania have contemplated but have not enacted significant reform of their health insurance markets other states are expected to consider these types of reforms as well as more modest reforms aimed at expanding medicaid andor schip eligibility as well as new coverage options for those not eligible for government programs these proposals include provisions affecting both public programs and privately financed health insurance arrangements states also are considering proposals that would reform the underwriting and marketing practices of individual and group health insurance products by for example placing restrictions on rating and pricing and mandating minimum medical benefit cost ratios in addition from time to time congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which if adopted could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under erisa additionally there is legislative interest in modifying erisa’s preemptive effect on state laws if adopted such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations 

we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law or if enacted what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be but their enactment could increase our costs expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our operating results could be adversely affected by such changes even if we correctly predict their occurrence 

in addition the health care industry is subject to negative publicity negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services requiring us to change our products and services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

in august 2007 we entered into a multistate national agreement with regulatory offices in 39 states and the district of columbia relating to the legacy unitedhealthcare fully insured commercial business the agreement covers several key areas of review of our business operations including claims payment accuracy and timeliness appeals and grievances resolution timeliness health care professional networkservice utilization review explanation of benefits accuracy and oversight and due diligence of contracted entities and vendor performance the agreement addressed and resolved past regulatory matters related to the areas of review prior to august 2007 and establishes a transparent framework for evaluating and regulating performance through december 2010 on a prospective basis the agreement is similar to a customer performance guarantee whereby we will self report quarterly and annually our operational performance on a set of national performance standards agreed to by the participating states we must perform to the standards set forth in the agreement or be subject to fines and penalties 

we are also involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these regulatory activities include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and 

  

welfare departments and state attorneys general the office of the inspector general the office of personnel management the office of civil rights the us department of justice us attorneys the sec the irs the us department of labor and other governmental authorities for example in 2007 the california department of insurance examined the company’s pacificare health insurance plan in california the examination findings related to claims processing accuracy and timeliness accurate and timely interest payments timely implementation of provider contracts timely accurate provider dispute resolution and other related matters to date the california department of insurance has not levied a financial penalty related to its findings the company is working closely with the department to resolve any outstanding issues arising from the findings of its examination in addition the us department of labor is conducting an investigation of our administration of our employee benefit plans with respect to erisa compliance reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions which can result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services 

adverse conditions in the global economy and extreme disruption of financial markets could adversely affect our revenues sources of liquidity investment portfolio and our results of operations 

as widely reported worldwide financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruption including volatility in the prices of securities and severely diminished liquidity and availability of credit these extreme events along with a recession inflation or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

for example higher unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings could lead to lower enrollment in our employer group plans lower enrollment in our nonemployer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans the adverse economic conditions could also cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs in addition the economic downturn could negatively impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could adversely affect our financial results in addition a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers and therefore could adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs 

during a prolonged economic downturn state and federal budgets could be adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including medicare medicaid and schip a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated andor received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and financial results in addition the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs such as premium taxes on health maintenance organizations and surcharges on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the current economic crisis is causing contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace while our largest source of funding has historically been cash flow from operations the commercial paper markets have been a source of liquidity for us and we continue to issue commercial paper although at higher interest rates as a result of the diminished availability of credit however there can be no assurance that the commercial paper 

  

markets will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing if the commercial paper markets are unavailable or not cost effective we would use cash on hand andor draw on our contractually committed revolving credit facilities to refinance the commercial paper when it matures however there can be no assurance that under extreme market conditions such sources would be available or sufficient 

in addition if the global capital markets continue to deteriorate including if more financial institutions and companies file for bankruptcy protection or are taken over by governmental authorities and if the prices of securities continue to deteriorate and experience extreme volatility our investment portfolio may be impacted some of our investments could further experience otherthantemporary declines in fair value requiring us to record an impairment charge that could adversely impact our financial results 

our businesses providing pbm services are subject to federal and state regulations associated with the pbm industry and if we fail to comply with these regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we provide pbm services through our prescription solutions and unitedhealthcare businesses each business is subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers customers and consumers in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies see item 1 “business – government regulation” for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our pbm businesses 

in the event a court were to determine that one of our pbm businesses acts as a fiduciary under erisa we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies preferred drug listings and drug management programs contracting network practices specialty drug distribution and other transactions our pbm businesses also conduct business as mail order pharmacies which subjects them to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pbm subsidiaries to civil and criminal penalties 

in addition we would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products further our pbm businesses are subject to the payment card industry data security standards which is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management policies procedures network architecture software design and other critical protective measures to protect customer account data as mandated by the credit card brands the failure to adhere to such standards could expose our pbm subsidiaries to liability or impact their ability to process credit card transactions 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate we compete with other companies on the basis of many factors including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives location and choice of health care providers quality of customer service comprehensiveness of coverage offered reputation for quality care financial stability and diversity of product offerings for our health care services reporting segment competitors include aetna inc cigna corporation coventry health care inc health net inc humana inc kaiser permanente wellpoint inc numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare specialty services for our prescription solutions business competitors include medco health solutions inc cvs caremark corporation and express scripts inc our optumhealth and ingenix reporting segments also compete with a number of other businesses 

  

we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors in particular markets competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage greater market share established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements existing business relationships and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors 

in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals in these industries consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or to maintain or advance profitability if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect if membership or demand for other services declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

as a payer in various government health care programs we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments and audits that could adversely affect our revenues cash flows and financial results 

we participate in various federal state and local government health care coverage programs including as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d various medicaid programs and schip and receive revenues from these programs these programs generally are subject to frequent changes including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may do so in the future 

our participation in the medicare advantage medicare part d and various medicaid programs and schip occurs through bids that are submitted periodically revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and financial results 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs including determining payments by considering the risk status of our medicare members as supported by provider medical record documentation federal regulators audit the supporting documents and can revise payments based on the audit findings cms announced in 2008 that it will perform audits of selected medicare health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by care providers these audits involve a review of medical records maintained by providers including those in and out of network and may result in retrospective or prospective adjustments to payments made to health plans pursuant to cms medicare contracts certain of our plans have been selected for audit the first audits focused on medical records supporting risk adjustment data for 2006 that were used to determine 2007 payment amounts we are unable to predict the outcome of the audits however a material adjustment could have a material effect on our financial results 

our ability to retain and acquire medicare medicaid and schip enrollees is impacted by bids and plan designs submitted by us and our competitors under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed 

  

care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold which is set by the government after our bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and we will not have additional members autoassigned to us for example we lost approximately 650000 of our autoenrolled lowincome subsidy members in 2008 because our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect or our competitors’ bids and positioning are different than anticipated either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or otherwise our financial results could be materially affected 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers our business could be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for competitive prices and services our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers whether innetwork or outofnetwork could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in any particular market physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

in addition we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers under the typical arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member under some capitated arrangements the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

in addition some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding with the provider about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these outofnetwork providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms in some instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us for example 

  

we are involved in litigation with outofnetwork providers that is described in more detail in “legal matters” in note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with these outofnetwork health care providers could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract retain and provide support to a network of independent third party brokers consultants and agents 

our products are sold in part through independent brokers consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business we typically do not have longterm contracts with our independent brokers consultants and agents who generally are not exclusive to us and who frequently also recommend andor market health care products and services of our competitors as a result we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales would be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent brokers consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to them regarding our product portfolio which is complex or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 

in addition there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care products and the payments they receive these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling these companies’ products for example cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans andor changes to industry practice which could adversely impact our ability to market our products 

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 

the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal glba and in hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as such term is defined in the hipaa regulations see item 1 “business – government regulation” for a discussion of various federal and state privacy laws and regulations governing our businesses 

even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates we still have limited control over their actions and practices privacy and security requirements regarding personally identifiable information are also imposed on us through controls with our customers in addition despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism or theft computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events congress and many states are considering new privacy and security requirements that would apply to our business compliance with new privacy and security laws requirements and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes new limitations or constraints on our business models the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates they also may impose further restrictions on our collection disclosure and use of patient identifiable data that are housed in one or more of our administrative databases noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information whether by us or by one of our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations including material fines and penalties compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

under our agreements with aarp we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance hospital indemnity insurance and other products to aarp members and medicare part d prescription drug plans to aarp members and nonmembers one of our agreements with aarp expands the relationship to include aarpbranded medicare advantage plans for aarp members and nonmembers our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance corporate social responsibility diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances including depending on the agreement a material breach by either party insolvency of either party a material adverse change in the financial condition of the company material changes in the medicare programs material harm to aarp caused by the company and by mutual agreement the success of our aarp arrangements depends in part on our ability to service aarp and its members develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively meet our corporate governance corporate social responsibility and diversity commitments and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

because of the nature of our business we are routinely subject to various litigation actions which if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalties andor monetary damages and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

periodically we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims shareholder suits and intellectual propertyrelated litigation in addition because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings these matters include among others claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals medical malpractice actions contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups 

we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters however it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 

a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters therefore these legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

matters relating to or arising out of our historical stock option practices including regulatory inquiries litigation matters and potential additional cash and noncash charges could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in early 2006 our board of directors initiated an independent review of the company’s historical stock option practices from 1994 to 2005 the independent review was conducted by an independent committee comprised of three independent directors of the company independent committee with the assistance of independent counsel and independent accounting advisors on october 15 2006 we announced that the independent committee had 

  

completed their review of the company’s historical stock option practices and reported the findings to the nonmanagement directors of the company as a result of our historical stock option practices we restated our previously filed financial statements we incurred certain cash and noncash charges we are subject to various regulatory inquiries and litigation matters and we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries litigation matters and cash and noncash charges the outcome of any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us see note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these regulatory inquiries and litigation matters 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially adversely affect our financial results 

fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in fixed income debt securities of varying maturities which comprise the majority of the fair value of our investments at december 31 2008 in addition defaults by issuers primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds who fail to pay or perform on their obligations could reduce our investment income and net realized investment gains or result in net realized investment losses as we may be required to write down the value of our investments which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders’ equity 

we also invest a small proportion of our investments in equity investments which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments general economic conditions stock market conditions and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 

there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments changes in the value of our investment assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations illiquidity or otherwise could have a negative effect on our shareholders’ equity in addition if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations shareholders’ equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected 

due largely to our past acquisitions goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately 224 billion as of december 31 2008 representing approximately 40 of our total assets if we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could in turn negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 

largescale medical emergencies may result in significant health care costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

largescale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically for example in the event of a natural disaster bioterrorism attack pandemic or other extreme events we could face among other things significant health care costs and increased use of health care services any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems our business could be materially adversely affected 

our ability to adequately price our products and services to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of technology initiatives changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been taking steps to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer patterns if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals have regulatory problems have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and operating results 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock and our ability to repay our debt if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

  

any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders downgrades in our ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

business overview 

unitedhealth group is a diversified health and wellbeing company serving more than 70 million americans our focus is on enhancing the performance of the health system and improving the overall health and wellbeing of the people we serve and their communities we work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care we help people get the care they need at an affordable cost support the physicianpatient relationship and empower people with the information guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions 

through our diversified family of businesses we leverage core competencies in advanced technologybased transactional capabilities health care data knowledge and information and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better we provide individuals with access to quality costeffective health care services and resources we provide employers and consumers with excellent value service and support and we deliver value to our shareholders by executing a business strategy founded upon a commitment to balanced growth profitability and capital discipline 

business trends 

our businesses participate in the us health economy which comprises approximately 16 of gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years management expects overall spending on health care in the us to continue to rise in the future based on inflation demographic trends in the us population and national interest in health and wellbeing the rate of growth may be impacted by a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions and proposed health care reforms which could also impact our results of operations 

adverse economic conditions 

the current us recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for certain of our products and services for example decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers and will pressure top line growth for our unitedhealthcare business in contrast our americhoice business has seen increased participation in its state medicaid offerings as employment rates fall if the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate andor impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments in total management believes that economic recessions will slow our revenue growth rate and could impact our operating profitability management also believes that government funding pressure coupled with recessionary economic conditions will impact the financial positions of hospitals physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses for additional discussions regarding how a prolonged economic downturn could affect our business see item 1a “risk factors” 

proposed federal economic stimulus package 

in the short term our businesses may benefit if proposed elements of the federal economic stimulus package responding to the current recession are signed into law these include expansion of funding to state programs 

  

which could mitigate funding pressure for americhoice medicaid offerings at the state level expansion of coverage for recently unemployed workers through their former employers’ plans which could enhance participation in unitedhealthcare benefit programs and funding for health care information technology which could expand market opportunities for ingenix 

proposed health care reforms 

there is regular dialogue about health care reforms at both state and national levels due to the size of and national interest in the health economy examples of these health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry such as having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system or a fundamental restructuring of the medicare or medicaid programs 

the new administration and various congressional leaders have signaled their interest in reducing payments to private plans offering medicare advantage depending on the extent and phasing of these potential reductions management believes that the number of seniors participating in medicare advantage and the industrywide earnings derived from these plans may fall however if payment rates do come down management believes that there are a number of adjustments we can make to our operations annually which may partially offset any earnings impact for example we can adjust members’ benefits we can decide on a countybycounty basis which geographies to participate in and we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management any payment reductions may be phased in over a number of years if industrywide medicare advantage membership reduces there is likely to be increased demand for medicare supplemental insurance and part d prescription drug coverage and in both categories ovations is also a market leader 

we operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors therefore we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for various of our products and services depending on the scope shape and timing of health care reforms it is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid to longterm time horizon for additional discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms see item 1a “risk factors”

2008 results compared to 2007 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

revenues consist of premium revenues from riskbased products service revenues which primarily include fees for management administrative and consulting services product revenues and investment and other income 

premium revenues are primarily derived from riskbased health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed typically for a oneyear period and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that selfinsure the medical costs of their employees and their dependants for both premium riskbased and feebased customer arrangements we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services transaction processing health care professional services and access to contracted networks of physicians hospitals and other health care professionals through our prescription solutions pbm business revenues are derived from both products sold and administrative services product revenues also include sales of ingenix publishing and software products 

consolidated revenues for 2008 increased from 2007 primarily due to the increase in premium revenue in the health care services reporting segment the following is a discussion of consolidated revenues for each of our revenue components 

premium revenues the premium revenue growth generated by our health care services reporting segment was the primary driver in the consolidated premium revenues increase this increase was due to the growth in individuals served by our public and senior markets group premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and acquisitions completed in 2008 partially offset by a decline in individuals served through both unitedhealthcare riskbased products and medicare part d prescription drug plans 

service revenues the increase in service revenues for 2008 was driven by an increased number of individuals served by feebased product arrangements in the health care services reporting segment primarily due to the fiserv health acquisition in addition our ingenix reporting segment generated service revenue growth from its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions 

product revenues product revenues for 2008 increased due to increased prescription volume at our prescription solutions reporting segment primarily related to the fiserv health acquisition 

  

investment and other income the decrease in investment and other income in 2008 was primarily due to lower investment yields primarily as a result of the decrease in interest rates on our cash equivalents decreased average investment balances related to lower operating cash flows decreased deposits held for certain governmentsponsored programs and increased otherthantemporary impairment charges related to the disruption in the financial markets 

medical costs 

medical costs for 2008 increased primarily due to medical cost inflation acquisitions completed in 2008 and growth in ovations medicare advantage and medicare supplement products partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through both unitedhealthcare riskbased products and medicare part d prescription drug plans 

the medical care ratio calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues reflects the combination of pricing benefit designs consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts our consolidated medical care ratio increase was primarily driven by premium rates advancing more slowly than medical costs in 2008 for certain riskbased products in the commercial senior and behavioral care markets 

for each period our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period are included in total medical costs reported for the current period medical costs for 2008 included approximately 230 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years medical costs for 2007 included approximately 420 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 

operating costs 

the operating cost ratio calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues increased in 2008 primarily due to certain expenses as discussed below acquisitions completed in 2008 costs for anticipated revenue growth that did not fully materialize and a change in business mix towards service revenues from feebased businesses 

operating costs for 2008 include 882 million for the proposed settlements of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs net of expected insurance proceeds and 350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for outofnetwork medical services partially offset by a 185 million reduction in expenses for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership of our individual medicare advantage hmo plans in clark and nye counties nevada relating to the sierra acquisition these amounts have been recorded in the corporate segment for a discussion of the proposed settlements see note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating costs for 2007 include 176 million of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under section 409a of the internal revenue code section 409a to our historical stock option practices the 176 million section 409a charge includes 87 million of expenses for the payment of certain optionholders’ tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and 89 million of expenses for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments these amounts have been recorded in the corporate segment for an expanded discussion of our section 409a charges see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

cost of products sold 

cost of products sold increased due to increased prescription volume at our prescription solutions reporting segment primarily related to the fiserv health acquisition 

depreciation and amortization 

the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology development and enhancements as well as additional depreciation and amortization related to recent business acquisitions 

interest expense 

interest expense increased due to an increase in our debt outstanding which was partially offset by lower market interest rates on our floatingrate debt 

income taxes 

the decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings resulting in an increased proportion of taxfree investment income to total earnings 

reporting segments 

we have four reporting segments 

 

  

  

  

 transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to health care services customers by prescription solutions certain product offerings sold to health care services customers by optumhealth and medical benefits cost quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to health care services by ingenix these transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation 

  

the following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments for the years ended december 31 

 

  

nm  not meaningful 

health care services 

the revenue growth in health care services for 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets group premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and the 2008 acquisitions of sierra fiserv health and unison partially offset by an organic decline in individuals served through commercial riskbased products and medicare part d products and a decrease in investment income unitedhealthcare revenues of 418 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by 16 billion or 4 the unitedhealthcare increase was primarily driven by the same factors as discussed for health care services in 2008 ovations revenues of 281 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by 16 billion or 6 the increase was primarily due to an increase in individuals served with the standardized medicare supplement and medicare advantage products gained through both organic growth and the sierra acquisition and premium rate increases which were partially offset by a net organic decrease of 675000 standalone medicare part d members primarily due to the reassignment by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms of certain dualeligible low income beneficiaries based on annual price bids americhoice generated revenues of 60 billion in 2008 an increase of 15 billion or 34 over the comparable 2007 period primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by medicaid plans premium rate increases and the acquisition of unison in the second quarter of 2008 

the decrease in health care services earnings from operations was primarily due to pressure on enrollment and gross margins in the unitedhealthcare riskbased business and pressure on gross margins in medicare part d 

  

prescription drug plans partially offset by acquisitions the unitedhealthcare medical care ratio increased to 835 in 2008 from 826 in 2007 this increase was primarily driven by the effects of a competitive pricing environment where price increases net of customer benefit package changes did not fully match the rise in medical costs and an increased mix of national account pharmaceutical benefit business which typically carries a higher medical care ratio health care services’ operating margin was 67 for the year ended december 31 2008 a decrease from 93 in 2007 primarily driven by the factors discussed above 

the following summarizes the number of individuals served by major market segment and funding arrangement at december 31 

 

 the number of individuals served with commercial products increased due to acquisitions which included the addition of 1315000 feebased members from fiserv health and the addition of 310000 riskbased individuals gained through the sierra acquisition these additions were partially offset by a net decline in individuals served with commercial products of 805000 or 3 from december 31 2007 primarily due to a decline in individuals served with commercial riskbased products and the impact of a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment the number of individuals served by medicare advantage products at december 31 2008 increased through the addition of 60000 seniors from our acquisition of sierra and organic growth of 95000 seniors partially offset by the divestiture of 30000 individuals in nevada related to the sierra acquisition medicaid enrollment grew due to the addition of 320000 and 60000 individuals from our unison and sierra acquisitions respectively and strong organic growth of 425000 individuals 

optumhealth 

increased revenues in optumhealth were driven by rate increases for medical cost inflation and an increased number of consumers served by this segment optumhealth provided services to approximately 60 million consumers at december 31 2008 an increase of approximately 1 million individuals yearoveryear 

earnings from operations and operating margin decreased due to the increased costs for riskbased behavioral and specialty benefits businesses and the mix of continued growth in lower margin business 

ingenix 

the improvement in ingenix revenues was due to continued growth in its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions the decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to excess staffing costs during 2008 for certain research projects which were cancelled as well as lower demand for certain consulting services due to the current economic environment 

prescription solutions 

the decreased prescription solutions revenues were primarily due to the reduction in the number of individuals served related to the reassignment of dualeligible beneficiaries described above through medicare part d 

  

prescription drug plans by our ovations business which is the largest customer of this reporting segment and a shift from name brand pharmaceuticals towards generic utilization partially offset by revenues related to the fiserv health acquisition and growth in business with unaffiliated clients intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were 110 billion and 124 billion for 2008 and 2007 respectively 

prescription solutions earnings from operations increased primarily due to the fiserv health acquisition gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals 

2007 results compared to 2006 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

consolidated revenues increased in 2007 primarily due to rate increases on premiumbased and feebased services and growth in the total number of individuals served by health care services 

premium revenues consolidated premium revenues increased in 2007 primarily due to premium rate increases partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial riskbased products 

premium revenues for unitedhealthcare in 2007 totaled 362 billion an increase of 623 million or 2 over 2006 this increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of 7 to 8 on unitedhealthcare’s renewing commercial riskbased products and due to premiums from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 this was partially offset by a 4 decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial riskbased products in 2007 primarily due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial feebased products ovations premium revenues in 2007 totaled 260 billion an increase of 17 billion or 7 over 2006 this increase was driven primarily by an increase in individuals served by standardized medicare supplement and evercare products and rate increases on medicare advantage products as well as continued growth in our medicare part d program americhoice premium revenues increased by 732 million or 20 over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by medicaid products as well as rate increases the remaining premium revenue increase resulted primarily from membership growth and rate increases at optumhealth which contributed a premium revenue increase of 11 over 2006 

service revenues the 2007 increase in consolidated service revenues was driven primarily by a 38 increase in ingenix service revenues due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 in addition unitedhealthcare service revenues increased due to a 3 increase in the number of individuals served under commercial feebased arrangements during 2007 as well as annual rate increases 

product revenues the 2007 increase in consolidated product revenues was driven by pharmacy sales growth at prescription solutions primarily due to providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million ovations medicare advantage and part d members 

investment and other income interest income increased by 239 million in 2007 driven by increased levels of cash and fixedincome investments due in part to deposits held for certain governmentsponsored programs during 2007 and the lack of share repurchase activity in the first two and one half months of 2007 net realized gains on sales of investments were 38 million in 2007 and 4 million in 2006 

medical costs 

the consolidated medical care ratio decreased primarily due to a decrease in the medical care ratio relating to ovations which was partially offset by an increase in the commercial medical care ratio resulting from our 

  

internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for unitedhealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007 

medical costs for 2007 included approximately 420 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years medical costs for 2006 included approximately 430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 

medical costs for 2007 increased primarily due to an annual medical cost trend of 7 to 8 on commercial riskbased business due to medical cost inflation and increased utilization as well as growth in ovations medicare programs partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial riskbased products 

operating costs 

the operating cost ratio for 2007 was consistent with 2006 the operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives offset by the effect of business mix change as feebased businesses such as ingenix increase in size and impact as well as increased investment in technology service and product enhancements incremental marketing and advertising costs for medicare advantage products and expenses in the first quarter of 2007 associated with the application of deferred compensation rules under section 409a to our historical stock option practices as described in “2008 results compared to 2007 results” above 

the increase in operating costs in 2007 was primarily due to general operating cost inflation and was also impacted by the items discussed above 

cost of products sold 

cost of products sold increased in 2007 primarily due to costs associated with increased pharmacy sales at prescription solutions as a result of providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million ovations medicare advantage and part d members in 2007 

depreciation and amortization 

the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2007 was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 as well as separately identifiable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions since the beginning of 2006 

reporting segments 

health care services 

unitedhealthcare revenues of 403 billion in 2007 increased by 821 million or 2 over 2006 this increase was driven mainly by average net premium rate increases of 7 to 8 on unitedhealthcare’s renewing commercial riskbased products an increase in the number of individuals served by commercial feebased products and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 this was partially offset by a 4 decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial riskbased products in 2007 primarily due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial feebased products ovations revenues of 265 billion in 2007 increased by approximately 18 billion or 7 over 2006 the increase was primarily driven by an increase in individuals served by standardized medicare supplement and evercare products and rate increases on medicare advantage products as well as continued growth in our medicare part d program the remaining health care services revenue increase 

  

resulted from an increase in americhoice revenues of 750 million or 20 over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by medicaid products as well as rate increases 

the increase in health care services earnings from operations in 2007 was principally driven by a decrease in the medical care ratio for ovations primarily due to favorable medical cost trends and an increase in the number of individuals served by certain medicare products and related rate increases discussed above partially offset by a decrease in individuals served by commercial riskbased products and an increase in the related medical care ratio the unitedhealthcare medical care ratio increased to 826 in 2007 from 805 in 2006 this increase was mainly due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for unitedhealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007 which was partially driven by costs from higher benefit utilization in december 2006 primarily relating to highdeductible riskbased products the health care services operating margin for 2007 was 93 an increase from 86 in 2006 which reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and disciplined operating cost management as well as the factors discussed above 

the increase in the number of individuals served with commercial feebased products as of december 31 2007 was driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from riskbased products to feebased products partially offset by employment attrition at continuing customers the number of individuals served with commercial riskbased products decreased primarily due to a competitive pricing environment and the conversion of individuals to feebased products 

the number of individuals served by medicare advantage products as of december 31 2007 decreased primarily due to a decline in participation in privatefeeforservice offerings while individuals served by standardized medicare supplement products increased due to new customer relationships medicaid enrollment increased in 2007 primarily due to new customer gains including 180000 individuals served under the tenncare program in tennessee 

optumhealth 

the optumhealth revenues increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses 

optumhealth earnings from operations increased in 2007 primarily due to the membership growth and rate increases the optumhealth operating margin declined from 186 in 2006 to 182 in 2007 due to a continued business mix shift toward higher revenue lower margin products partially offset by effective operating cost management

the ingenix revenues increase in 2007 was primarily driven by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 

the increase in earnings from operations was primarily due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 and effective operating cost management the operating margin was 204 in 2007 up from 184 in 2006 this increase in operating margin was largely driven by business growth and operating cost management described above 

prescription solutions 

the prescription solutions revenues increase in 2007 was primarily driven by providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million ovations medicare advantage and standalone part d members 

  

intersegment revenues were eliminated in consolidation and amounted to 124 billion and 34 billion for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

prescription solutions earnings from operations increased largely due to the expansion of services to medicare part d members discussed above the operating margin was 20 in 2007 a decrease from 34 in 2006 the decrease in operating margin reflected the comparatively lower margin earned in the high volume ovations medicare part d prescription drug service contracts 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity and financial condition 

we manage our cash investments and capital structure to meet the short and longterm obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility we forecast analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash cash equivalents and investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected shortterm obligations in longer term investmentgrade marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return these investments are made pursuant to our board of directors’ approved investment policy which generally governs return objectives regulatory limitations tax implications and risk tolerances which focuses on preservation of capital diversification and duration cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their nonregulated parent companies typically in the form of dividends for general corporate use when and as permitted by applicable regulations 

our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and longterm debt as well as the availability of committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses by making capital expenditures expanding our services through business acquisitions and repurchasing shares of our common stock depending on market conditions 

cash flows generated from operating activities our primary source of liquidity are principally from net earnings prior to depreciation and amortization and other noncash expenses as a result any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity the level of profitability of our riskbased business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses the geographic and customer diversity of our riskbased business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs 

  

a summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below 

 net cash flows from operating activities decreased 16 billion in 2008 or 28 primarily due to the decrease in net earnings of 17 billion which included payments of 573 million net of taxes for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices for detail on these settlements see note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2008 our cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investment balances of 214 billion included 74 billion of cash and cash equivalents 135 billion of debt securities and 477 million of equity securities and venture capital funds given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies primarily used in valuing our level 3 equity securities may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments due to the subjective nature of these assumptions the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if the investment was sold at the measurement date other sources of liquidity primarily from operating cash flows reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets see note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our fair value measurements 

our investment portfolio has a relatively short average duration and a weighted average credit rating of “aa” as of december 31 2008 included in the debt securities balance is 33 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties the securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor neither indirect through the guarantees nor direct through investment in the guarantor further due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “aa” as of december 31 2008 for the securities for which such information is available 

commercial paper commercial paper consisted of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities up to 270 days as of december 31 2008 we had 101 million of outstanding commercial paper with interest rates ranging from 51 to 71 this range in rates reflects increases in the market rates for tier2 creditrated commercial paper 

share repurchases under our board of directors’ authorization we maintain a common share repurchase program repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices during 2008 we repurchased 72 million shares at an average price of approximately 37 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately 27 billion as of december 31 2008 we had board of directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 103 million shares of our common stock 

  

capital resources 

as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we had commercial paper and longterm debt outstanding of 128 billion and 110 billion respectively 

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital we have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital 

cash cash equivalents and investments we maintained a highly liquid position with cash cash equivalents and investments of 216 billion as of december 31 2008 as further described under “dividend restrictions” many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies as of december 31 2008 approximately 865 million of our 216 billion of cash and investments was held by nonregulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use including acquisitions and share repurchases 

shelf registration in february 2008 we filed a universal s3 shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission sec registering an unlimited amount of debt securities 

credit ratings our credit ratings at december 31 2008 were as follows 

 

 see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of our risks related to downgrades in our credit ratings 

debt covenants our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debttototalcapital ratio below 50 our debttototalcapital ratio calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper debt and shareholders’ equity was 381 and 354 as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively we were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of december 31 2008 in august 2006 we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our 58 senior unsecured notes due march 15 2036 alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities this followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2006 see note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the proceeding regarding the purported default 

bank credit facilities in november 2008 we entered into a 750 million 364day revolving bank credit facility which replaced our 15 billion 364day revolving bank credit facility entered into in november 2007 the interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on libor plus a spread at december 31 2008 the interest rate ranged from 29 to 43 

in may 2007 we amended and restated our 13 billion fiveyear revolving bank credit facility which included increasing the capacity there is currently 25 billion available under this credit facility which matures in may 2012 the interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on libor plus a spread at december 31 2008 the interest rate ranged from 06 to 20 

  

these credit facilities support our commercial paper program and are available for general working capital purposes as of december 31 2008 we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities 

dividend restrictions we conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to regulations and standards established by their respective states of domicile most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the national association of insurance commissioners these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock in addition an inability to pay regulated dividends could impact our ability to repay our debt however our cash flows from operations of our unregulated businesses as well as liquidity at the parent level in the form of cash and cash equivalent balances and commercial paper or bank funding mitigate this risk see item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of our risks related to dividend restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries 

in 2008 based on the 2007 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was 30 billion as of december 31 2008 our regulated subsidiaries have paid their parent companies dividends of 42 billion including 12 billion of extraordinary dividends approved by state insurance regulators in 2007 the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was 25 billion in 2007 29 billion was paid to their parent companies including 400 million of extraordinary dividends approved by state insurance regulators 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2008 under our various contractual obligations and commitments 

 

  

     

     we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations this includes internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2008 we were not involved in any spe transactions 

recently issued accounting standards 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position fas 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” fsp 1423 fsp 1423 amends the factors to be considered in developing renewal and extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset accounted for under fas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fsp 1423 is effective for our fiscal year 2009 and must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after january 1 2009 early adoption is not permitted we do not expect the adoption of fsp 1423 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued fas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” fas 141r which replaces fas no 141 “business combinations” fas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in our financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired the statement also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination fas 141r is effective for our fiscal year 2009 and must be applied prospectively to all new acquisitions closing on or after january 1 2009 early adoption of this standard is not permitted we do not expect the adoption of fas 141r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued fas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” fas 160 fas 160 requires that accounting and reporting for minority interests be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity the 

  

standard is effective for our fiscal year 2009 and must be applied prospectively we do not expect the adoption of fas 160 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

medical costs 

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption health care professional contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service we estimate liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development historically the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1 of annual medical costs less than 5 of annual earnings from operations and less than 4 of medical costs payable 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36month period a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation for months prior to the most recent three months we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicatedtodate in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months we do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors accordingly for the most recent three months we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease 

  

control as well as through a review of nearterm completion factors this approach is consistently applied from period to period 

completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods generally periods prior to the most recent three months the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2008 

 

 medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31 2008 

 

 the analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

in order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations 

 

  

     

our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2008 developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2008 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2008 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance 2008 net earnings would increase or decrease by 48 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by 004 per share 

the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation these include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals we emphasize preventive health care appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards education and closing gaps in care 

we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful however other factors including competitive pressures new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers major epidemics and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation because of the narrow operating margins of our riskbased products changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 

revenues 

revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services as recorded in our records employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing we estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly our estimates are based on historical trends premiums billed the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 

we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate are expected to have higher medical costs under this risk adjustment methodology cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings necessary and available diagnosis data collected and captured by us and health care providers is submitted to cms within prescribed deadlines 

goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

as of december 31 2008 we had longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and property equipment and capitalized software of 246 billion we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and we review our remaining longlived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value to determine the fair value of our longlived assets and assess their recoverability we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues expenses and operating margins if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the 

  

future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs there were no material impairments at december 31 2008 

investments 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 141 billion of investments primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses net of income tax effects as a separate component in shareholders’ equity we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2008 our investments had gross unrealized gains of 312 million and gross unrealized losses of 349 million if any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be otherthantemporary based on analysis of relevant factors we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment’s fair value is otherthantemporary we analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost new information and the passage of time can change these judgments we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities assetbacked and corporate debt obligations substantially all of investment grade quality if securities are downgraded below policy minimums subsequent to purchase they will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy 

contingent liabilities 

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel if appropriate and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage if any for such matters it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions see item 1a “risk factors” for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is included in note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base as of december 31 2008 we had an aggregate 20 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005 we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery currently the reinsurer is rated by am best as “a” as of december 31 2008 there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and expense and the fair value of certain of our fixedrate financial investments and debt and b changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 74 billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates which may materially impact our investment income also approximately 72 billion of our debt as of december 31 2008 was at interest rates that vary with market rates either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts which may materially impact our interest expense 

the fair value of certain of our fixedrate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates as of december 31 2008 approximately 137 billion of our investments were fixedrate debt securities and approximately 56 billion of our debt was fixedrate term debt with no related interest rate swap contracts an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt conversely a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixedrate investments and fixedrate debt 

we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts as part of our risk management strategy we enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense the differential between the fixed rates received and the variable rates paid is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations our swap agreements converted a majority of our interest expense from a fixed to variable rates to better offset the impact of market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments in january 2009 we terminated 49 billion notional of interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions to lockin the benefit of current low market interest rates additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1 or 2 as of december 31 2008 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our financial investments and debt in millions 

 

  

 as of december 31 2008 we had 477 million of equity securities and venture capital funds a portion of which were held in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments

in connection with the filing of this form 10k management evaluated under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2008 based upon that evaluation the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2008 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework  based on our assessment and those criteria we believe that as of december 31 2008 the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 

management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting the internal controls of sierra health services inc sierra and unison health plans unison which were acquired by the company on february 25 2008 and may 30 2008 respectively and are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements for the period from the dates of acquisition through year end such exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management’s report on internal controls over financial reporting in the year of acquisition net and total assets of sierra represented approximately 1 and 6 respectively of the company’s consolidated net and total assets as of december 31 2008 and approximately 2 of consolidated revenues and approximately 4 of net earnings for the year then ended net and total assets of unison represented approximately 0 and 2 respectively of the company’s consolidated net and total assets as of december 31 2008 and approximately 1 of consolidated revenue and net earnings for the year then ended 

changes to certain processes information technology systems and other components of internal control resulting from the acquisition of sierra and unison may occur and will be evaluated by management as such integration activities are implemented 

  

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 as stated in the report of independent registered public accounting firm appearing under item 9a which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2008

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and stockholders of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at sierra health services inc sierra and unison health plans unison which were acquired on february 25 2008 and may 30 2008 respectively and whose financial statements collectively constitute approximately 1 and 8 of net and total assets respectively approximately 3 of revenues and approximately 5 of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at sierra or unison the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 2007 results compared to 2006 results 

consolidated financial results 

revenues 

revenues are comprised of premium revenues from riskbased products service revenues which primarily include fees for management administrative and consulting services product revenues and investment and other income 

premium revenues are primarily derived from riskbased health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed typically for a oneyear period and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care services and related administrative costs service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that selfinsure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents for both premium riskbased and feebased customer arrangements we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services transaction processing customer consumer and care provider services and access to contracted networks of physicians hospitals and other health care professionals through our pharmacy benefit management pbm business prescription solutions revenues are derived from products sold and from administrative services product revenues also include sales of ingenix syndicated content products 

  

consolidated revenues in 2007 of 754 billion increased by 39 billion or 5 over 2006 driven primarily by rate increases on premiumbased and feebased services and growth in the total number of individuals served by health care services 

premium revenues consolidated premium revenues totaled 688 billion in 2007 an increase of 31 billion or 5 over 2006 this increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial riskbased products 

premium revenues for commercial markets unitedhealthcare and uniprise in 2007 totaled 362 billion an increase of 623 million or 2 over 2006 this increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of 7 to 8 on unitedhealthcare’s renewing commercial riskbased products and due to premiums from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 this was partially offset by a 4 decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial riskbased products in 2007 primarily due to the company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial feebased products ovations premium revenues in 2007 totaled 260 billion an increase of 17 billion or 7 over 2006 the increase was driven primarily by an increase in individuals served by standardized medicare supplement and evercare products and rate increases on medicare advantage products as well as continued growth in our medicare part d program americhoice premium revenues increased by 732 million or 20 over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by medicaid products as well as rate increases the remaining premium revenue increase resulted primarily from membership growth and rate increases at optumhealth which contributed a premium revenue increase of 11 over 2006 

service revenues consolidated service revenues in 2007 totaled 46 billion an increase of 340 million or 8 over 2006 this was driven primarily by a 38 increase in ingenix service revenues due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 in addition commercial markets service revenues increased due to a 3 increase in the number of individuals served under commercial feebased arrangements during 2007 as well as annual rate increases 

product revenues consolidated product revenues in 2007 totaled 898 million an increase of 161 million or 22 over 2006 the increase was driven by pharmacy sales growth at prescription solutions primarily due to providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million ovations medicare advantage and part d members 

investment and other income investment and other income during 2007 totaled 11 billion representing an increase of 273 million or 31 over 2006 interest income increased by 239 million in 2007 driven by increased levels of cash and fixedincome investments due in part to deposits held for certain governmentsponsored programs during 2007 and the lack of share repurchase activity in the first two and a half months of 2007 net realized gains on sales of investments were 38 million in 2007 and 4 million in 2006 we expect a slight decline in investment income in 2008 due to the declining interest rate environment in early 2008 as well as a comparatively lower level of invested asset balances expected in 2008 

medical costs 

the combination of pricing benefit designs consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues the consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 812 in 2006 to 806 in 2007 this was primarily due to a decrease in the medical care ratio relating to ovations which was partially offset by an increase in the commercial medical care ratio resulting from the company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for unitedhealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007 

  

for each period our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years resulting from more complete claim information and other facts and circumstances that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year medical costs for 2007 included approximately 420 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years medical costs for 2006 included approximately 430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 

medical costs for 2007 increased 21 billion or 4 to 554 billion primarily due to an annual medical cost trend of 7 to 8 on commercial riskbased business due to medical cost inflation and increased utilization as well as growth in ovations medicare programs partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial riskbased products 

operating costs 

the operating cost ratio operating costs as a percentage of total revenues for 2007 of 140 was consistent with 2006 the operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives offset by the effect of business mix change as feebased businesses such as ingenix increase in size and impact as well as increased investment in technology service and product enhancements incremental marketing and advertising costs for medicare advantage products and expenses in the first quarter of 2007 associated with the application of deferred compensation rules under section 409a of the internal revenue code section 409a to our historical stock option practices as described below 

operating costs in 2007 totaled 106 billion an increase of 602 million or 6 over 2006 this increase was primarily due to general operating cost inflation and was also impacted by the items discussed above 

included in the operating costs for 2007 is 176 million 112 million net of tax benefit of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under section 409a to our historical stock option practices as part of our review of the company’s historical stock option practices we determined that certain stock options granted to individuals who were nonexecutive officer employees at the time of grant were granted with an exercise price that was lower than the closing price of our common stock on the applicable accounting measurement date subjecting these individuals to additional tax under section 409a the company elected to pay these individuals for the additional tax costs relating to such stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 for any outstanding stock options subject to additional tax under section 409a that were granted to nonexecutive officer employees the company increased the exercise price and committed to make cash payments to these optionholders for their vested options based on the difference between the original stock option exercise price and the revised increased stock option exercise price the payments will be made on a quarterly basis upon vesting of the applicable awards the first payment of 110 million was made to optionholders in january 2008 for options vested through december 31 2007 aggregate future payments will be 38 million assuming all applicable options vest during 2008 and 2009 if the modified stock options are subsequently exercised the company will recover these cash payments at that time from exercise proceeds at the revised increased stock option exercise prices 

the 176 million section 409a charge includes 87 million of expense 55 million net of tax benefit for the payment of certain optionholders’ tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and 89 million of expense 57 million net of tax benefit for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments these amounts have been recorded as corporate expenses and have not been allocated to individual business segments 

as previously disclosed in december 2006 the company entered into agreements with individuals who were executive officers of the company at the time of grant of an applicable stock option to increase the exercise price of certain outstanding stock options no compensation was payable to any of those individuals as a result of the increase in the exercise price of their stock options 

  

cost of products sold 

cost of products sold in 2007 totaled 768 million an increase of 169 million or 28 over 2006 this was primarily due to costs associated with increased pharmacy sales at prescription solutions as a result of providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million ovations medicare advantage and part d members in 2007 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization in 2007 was 796 million an increase of 126 million or 19 over 2006 this increase was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 as well as separately identifiable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions since the beginning of 2006 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 363 in both 2007 and 2006

health care services earnings from operations in 2007 were 66 billion representing an increase of 735 million or 13 over 2006 this increase was principally driven by a decrease in the medical care ratio for ovations primarily due to favorable medical cost trends and an increase in the number of individuals served by certain medicare products and related rate increases discussed above partially offset by a decrease in individuals served by commercial riskbased products and an increase in the related medical care ratio the commercial markets medical care ratio increased to 826 in 2007 from 805 in 2006 and the unitedhealthcare medical care ratio increased to 821 in 2007 from 798 in 2006 these increases were mainly due to the company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for unitedhealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007 which was partially driven by costs from higher benefit utilization in december 2006 primarily relating to highdeductible riskbased products the health care services operating margin for 2007 was 93 an increase from 86 in 2006 which reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and disciplined operating cost management as well as the factors discussed above

medical costs for 2006 increased 196 billion or 58 to 533 billion due to the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 medical costs associated with the new medicare part d program and a medical cost trend of 7 to 8 on commercial riskbased business medical costs associated with the new medicare part d program for 2006 were 49 billion the medical cost trend was due to both medical inflation and increases in health care consumption 

operating costs 

the operating cost ratio for 2006 of 140 improved from 154 in 2005 this decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues primarily due to the new medicare part d program and the pacificare acquisition operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of feebased revenues the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives including cost savings associated with the pacificare acquisition integration and an insurance recovery of 43 million these items were partially offset by a 22 million charitable contribution to the united health foundation and approximately 44 million of additional cash expenses related to the stock option review exclusive of sharebased compensation expense 

operating costs in 2006 totaled 100 billion an increase of 28 billion or 40 over 2005 excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 operating costs increased by approximately 13 over 2005 the increase was primarily due to the new medicare part d program as well as a 4 increase in the total number of individuals served by health care services during 2006 excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005 growth in optumhealth and ingenix general operating cost inflation and the specific items discussed above partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment cost savings associated with acquisition integrations and other cost management initiatives 

  

cost of products sold 

cost of products sold in 2006 totaled 599 million an increase of 510 million over 2005 this increase was primarily due to increased pharmacy sales at prescription solutions which was acquired in december 2005 with the purchase of pacificare 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization in 2006 was 670 million an increase of 217 million or 48 over 2005 approximately 85 million of this increase was related to intangible assets from pacificare and other businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 the remaining increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 363 in 2006 and in 2005

health care services 

health care services had revenues of 678 billion in 2006 representing an increase of 237 billion or 54 over 2005 excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 health care services revenues increased by approximately 86 billion or 20 over 2005 commercial markets revenues of 395 billion in 2006 increased by 81 billion or 26 over 2005 excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 commercial markets revenues increased by approximately 2 over 2005 this was primarily due to an 8 increase in the number of individuals served with commercial feebased products and annual service fee rate increases for selfinsured customers as well as average premium rate increases of approximately 8 or above on unitedhealthcare’s renewing riskbased products partially offset by lower premium yields from a larger portion of new customer sales generated from highdeductible lowerpremium 

  

products and a 5 decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial riskbased products in 2006 primarily due to the company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to feebased products ovations revenues of 246 billion in 2006 increased by approximately 152 billion or 162 over 2005 excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005 ovations revenues increased by 78 billion or 85 over 2005 the increase was primarily driven by the successful launch of the medicare part d program which had premium revenues of 57 billion for 2006 and an increase in the number of individuals served by medicare advantage and standardized medicare supplement products as well as rate increases on these products the remaining increase in health care services revenues is attributable to a 8 increase in americhoice revenues excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 primarily driven by membership growth and premium revenue rate increases on medicaid products 

health care services earnings from operations in 2006 were 59 billion representing an increase of 15 billion or 34 over 2005 this increase was principally driven by acquisitions and increases in the number of individuals served by ovations’ medicare and part d products and commercial markets’ feebased products the segment also benefited by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives including cost savings associated with the pacificare acquisition integration these initiatives also reduced labor and occupancy costs in the transaction processing and customer service billing and enrollment functions the commercial markets medical care ratio increased to 805 in 2006 from 796 in 2005 and the unitedhealthcare medical care ratio increased to 798 in 2006 from 786 in 2005 mainly due to the impact of the pacificare acquisition and changes in product business and customer mix health care services’ operating margin for 2006 was 86 a decrease from 99 in 2005 this decrease was driven mainly by the acquisition of pacificare and the new medicare part d program which have lower operating margins than historic unitedhealth group businesses 

the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by health care services by major market segment and funding arrangement as of december 31 

 

 the number of individuals served by commercial products as of december 31 2006 increased by approximately 11 million or 5 over the prior year excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 commercial business individuals served increased by 565000 or 3 over the prior year this included an increase of approximately 10 million in the number of individuals served with commercial feebased products driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from riskbased products to feebased products offset by a decrease of approximately 475000 in the number of individuals served with commercial riskbased products primarily due to the company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to feebased products 

excluding businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 the number of individuals served by medicare advantage products increased by 230000 from 2005 primarily due to new customer relationships while individuals served by standardized medicare supplement products increased by 125000 or 6 due to new 

  

customer gains excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 medicaid enrollment increased 65000 or 5 primarily due to new customer gains 

optumhealth 

optumhealth revenues of 43 billion increased by 12 billion or 39 over 2005 excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 revenues increased by 20 over the prior period this increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses 

earnings from operations in 2006 of 809 million increased 235 million or 41 over 2005 optumhealth operating margin was 186 in 2006 up from 184 in 2005 realized improvements in operating cost structure and benefits from the integration of pacificare specialty operations in 2006 were partially offset by a business mix shift toward higher revenue lower margin products 

ingenix 

ingenix revenues for 2006 of 956 million increased by 160 million or 20 over 2005 this was primarily driven by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 earnings from operations in 2006 were 176 million up 46 million or 35 from 2005 operating margin was 184 in 2006 up from 163 in 2005 these increases in earnings from operations and operating margin were primarily due to growth in the health information and pharmaceutical services businesses improving gross margins due to effective cost management and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 

prescription solutions 

results for prescription solutions in 2006 included revenues of 41 billion earnings from operations of 139 million and operating margin of 34 the 2005 results included 78 million of revenue and no earnings from operations the increases in 2006 were primarily due to the timing of the acquisition of this business which was acquired in december 2005 with the purchase of pacificare 

liquidity financial condition and capital resources 

liquidity and financial condition 

we manage our cash investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and longterm obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity we forecast analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash cash equivalents and investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our shortterm obligations in longer term investmentgrade marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors’ approved investment policy regulatory limitations return objectives tax implications risk tolerance and maturity dates our longterm investments are also available for sale to meet shortterm liquidity and other needs cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their nonregulated parent companies typically in the form of dividends for general corporate use when and as permitted by applicable regulations 

our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with the issuance of commercial paper longterm debt and the 

  

availability of committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions and to repurchase shares of our common stock depending on market conditions 

cash flows generated from operating activities our primary source of liquidity are principally from premiums fee income and investment income any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity the level of profitability of our riskbased insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses the geographic diversity of our riskbased business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes which seek to match premium rate increases with estimated future health care costs in 2007 a hypothetical unexpected 1 increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately 190 million 

change in capital structure on october 31 2007 we announced that we may increase the debt component of our capital structure to the 40 percent range of debttototalcapital effective with our debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2007 and share repurchases through year end the debt component of our capital structure increased to 354 refer to “ — financing activities” below for further detail of the debt issuances including the february 2008 issuance these events increased our debttototalcapital ratio and will reduce our weighted average total cost of capital this change will also increase our interest expense during 2008 and thereafter as applicable as a result of this announcement on october 31 2007 standard  poor’s sp downgraded our senior debt rating one notch from “a” to “a” and our commercial paper rating one notch from “a1” to “a2” sp maintained our outlook at stable for both our senior debt and commercial paper on january 9 2008 moody’s downgraded our senior debt rating to “baa1” and returned our outlook to stable moody’s affirmed our commercial paper rating at “p2” with a stable outlook on january 30 2008 fitch downgraded our senior debt rating to “a” with a stable outlook and maintained our commercial paper rating at “f1” with a stable outlook the interest rates on our debt and commercial paper did not change as a result of the change in debt ratings we believe the prudent use of debt optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders’ equity while maintaining appropriate liquidity 

operating activities 

net cash flows from operating activities totaled 59 billion 65 billion and 41 billion for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively cash from operating activities in 2007 decreased from 2006 by 649 million or 10 due to a reduction in working capital cash flows of 15 billion partially offset by an increase of 495 million in net income the decrease in working capital cash flows was driven by lower medical costs payable growth primarily related to ovations medicare programs as the 2006 operating cash flows benefited from the initial establishment of the medical costs payable balance related to the medicare part d program fewer income tax refunds received in 2007 as well as larger income tax payments and the timing of certain government payments and receipts overall our receivables and related days sales outstanding increased primarily as a result of these governmental timing differences while our commercial business receivables remained relatively flat

hedging activities to more closely align interest costs with floating interest rates received on our cash equivalent and investment balances we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from fixed rates to variable rates the interest rate swap agreements have aggregate 

  

notional amounts of 56 billion as of december 31 2007 with variable rates that are benchmarked to the libor as of december 31 2007 the aggregate asset recorded at fair value for all existing interest rate swaps was approximately 151 million these interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges and are accounted for using the shortcut method under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” fas 133 whereby the hedges are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and the carrying value of the longterm debt is adjusted for an offsetting amount representing changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk since these amounts completely offset we have reported both the swap asset and the debt liability within debt in our consolidated balance sheets and there have been no net gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations at december 31 2007 the rates used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 41 to 61 

stock repurchases under our board of directors’ authorization we maintain a common stock repurchase program repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices subject to certain restrictions on volume pricing and timing during 2007 we repurchased 1253 million shares which were settled for cash on or before december 31 2007 at an average price of approximately 53 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately 66 billion during 2006 we repurchased 402 million shares which were settled for cash on or before december 31 2006 at an average price of approximately 56 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately 22 billion as of december 31 2007 we had board of directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 1719 million shares of our common stock our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares we expect to repurchase approximately 5 billion of our common stock in 2008 

capital resources 

as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately 110 billion and 75 billion respectively our debttototalcapital ratio was 354 and 264 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively commercial paper consisted of senior unsecured debt sold on a discounted basis with maturities up to 270 days 

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels debt ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and market conditions we believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk however a significant downgrade in ratings may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital see “— cautionary statements” for additional information 

cash and investments we maintained a strong liquidity position with cash and investments of 223 billion and 206 billion at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively total cash and investments increased by 17 billion since december 31 2006 primarily due to strong operating cash flows the issuance of debt and proceeds received from common stock issuances related to exercises of sharebased awards partially offset by common stock repurchases repayments of debt capital expenditures and funds paid to centers for medicare  medicaid services cms under the medicare part d program 

as further described under “— dividend restrictions” many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies at december 31 2007 approximately 24 billion of our 223 billion of cash and investments was held by nonregulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use including acquisitions and common stock repurchases

debt covenants our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debttototalcapital ratio calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper debt and shareholders’ equity below 50 we were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of december 31 2007 on august 28 2006 we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our 58 senior unsecured notes due march 15 2036 alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities this followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2006 see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for details 

bank credit facilities in november 2007 we entered into a 15 billion 364day revolving credit facility in order to expand our access to liquidity the credit facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general working capital purposes as of december 31 2007 we had no amounts outstanding under this bank credit facility 

in may 2007 we amended and restated our 13 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program we increased the credit facility to 26 billion and extended the maturity date to may 2012 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 

in october 2006 we entered into a 75 billion 364day revolving credit facility effective august 3 2007 we elected to reduce the amount of this facility to 15 billion this credit facility expired on october 15 2007 

dividend restrictions we conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to standards established by the national association of insurance commissioners these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

in 2007 and 2006 based on the previous years’ statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels the maximum amounts of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval were 25 billion and 22 billion respectively for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 the company’s regulated subsidiaries paid approximately 29 billion and 25 billion in dividends to their parent companies including approximately 400 million and 300 million of special dividends approved by state insurance regulators respectively 

  

contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and commitments 

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2007 under our various contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and commitments 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the table above includes a facility lease agreement that we signed in 2006 lease payments are expected to commence under this agreement in march 2009 at the time we occupy the facility and extend over a 20year period with total estimated lease payments of 229 million 

in conjunction with the pacificare acquisition we committed to make 50 million in charitable contributions for the benefit of california health care consumers which has been accrued in our consolidated balance sheets we have committed to specific projects totaling approximately 18 million of the 50 million charitable commitment at december 31 2007 of which 6 million was paid additionally we agreed to invest 200 million in 

  

california’s health care infrastructure to further health care services to the underserved populations of the california marketplace of which 8 million was invested at december 31 2007 the timing and amount of individual contributions and investments are at our discretion subject to the advice and oversight of the local regulatory authorities however our goal is to have the investment commitment fully funded by the end of 2010 the investment commitment remains in place for 20 years after funding the unfunded charitable commitment and investment commitment have been included in the above table 

at december 31 2007 we had pending cash acquisitions see note 4 of notes of the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

we do not have any other material contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations this includes internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

medicare part d pharmacy benefits contract 

beginning january 1 2006 the company began serving as a plan sponsor offering medicare part d prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with cms the company contracts with cms on an annual basis under medicare part d members have access to a standard drug benefit that features a monthly premium typically with an initial annual deductible coinsurance of 25 for the member and 75 for the company up to an initial coverage limit of 2400 of annual drug costs no insurance coverage between 2400 and 5451 except the member gets the benefit of the company’s significant drug discounts and catastrophic coverage for annual drug costs in excess of 5451 covered approximately 80 by cms 15 by the company and 5 by the member up to an annual outofpocket maximum of 3850 

the company’s contract with cms includes risksharing provisions wherein cms retains approximately 75 to 80 of the losses or profits outside a predefined risk corridor the risksharing provisions take effect if actual pharmacy benefit costs are more than 25 above or below expected cost levels as submitted by the company in its initial contract application contracts are generally noncancelable by enrollees however enrollees may change plans during an annual enrollment period each year 

as a result of the medicare part d product benefit design the company incurs a disproportionate amount of pharmacy benefit costs early in the contract year while the company is responsible for approximately 67 of a medicare part d beneficiary’s drug costs up to 2400 the beneficiary is responsible for 100 of their drug costs from 2400 up to 5451 at the company’s discounted purchase price consequently the company incurs a disproportionate amount of pharmacy benefit costs in the first half of the contract year as compared with the last half of the contract year when comparatively more members will be incurring claims above the 2400 initial coverage limit the uneven timing of medicare part d pharmacy benefit claims results in losses in the first half of the year that entitle the company to riskshare adjustment payments from cms accordingly during the interim periods within the contract year we record a net riskshare receivable from cms in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and a corresponding retrospective premium adjustment in premium revenues in the consolidated statements of operations this represents the estimated amount payable by cms to the company under the riskshare contract provisions if the program were terminated based on estimated costs incurred through that interim period those losses are typically expected to reverse in the second half of the year 

total premium revenues from cms related to the medicare part d program and all other medicarerelated programs were approximately 25 of our total consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2007 

as of january 1 2008 certain changes were made to the medicare part d coverage by cms including 

 

  

   

  

  

 these changes result in an increase in the amount of losses or profits that we may realize from this contract in 2008 as the amount of risk retained by cms has diminished 

aarp 

we provide health insurance products and services to members of aarp these products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional medicare aarp medicare supplement insurance hospital indemnity insurance health insurance focused on persons between 50 to 64 years of age and other products supplemental health insurance program under the supplemental health insurance program we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk we are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings premium revenues from our portion of the aarp supplemental health insurance program were approximately 53 billion in 2007 50 billion in 2006 and 49 billion in 2005 

the underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp medicare supplement insurance business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund rsf the primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue medical costs investment income administrative expenses member service expenses marketing expenses and premium taxes underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the rsf and accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the rsf to the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the rsf we would have to fund the deficit any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract to date we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits as further described in note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements the rsf balance is reported in other policy liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets we believe the rsf balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks and liabilities associated with the contract 

under separate trademark license agreements with aarp we sell aarpbranded medicare prescription drug benefit plans and medicare advantage plans we pay aarp a license fee for the use of the trademark and member data and assume all operational and underwriting risks 

on october 3 2007 we entered into new agreements with aarp which amended our existing arrangements see note 12 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we believe our critical accounting policies are those described below for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

medical costs 

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but 

  

not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption health care professional contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service we estimate liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development historically the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1 of annual medical costs less than 5 of annual earnings from operations and less than 4 of medical costs payable 

in developing our medical costs payable estimates we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated for example we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36month period a completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us as of the date of estimation for months prior to the most recent three months we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicatedtodate in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months we do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors accordingly for the most recent three months we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by a review of nearterm completion factors medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trends inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control as well as through a review of nearterm completion factors this approach is consistently applied from period to period 

completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods generally periods prior to the most recent three months the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31 2007 

 

   

medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical costs payable for the most recent three months the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31 2007 

 

  

  

 the analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience in estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 

in order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations 

 

  

  

  

 our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2007 developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2007 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2007 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable excluding the aarp business 2007 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by 72 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by 003 per share 

  

revenues 

revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services as recorded in our records employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing we estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly our estimates are based on historical trends premiums billed the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 

goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

as of december 31 2007 we had longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and property equipment and capitalized software of 207 billion we review our goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and we review our remaining longlived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value to determine the fair value of our longlived assets and assess their recoverability we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues expenses and operating margins if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 

investments 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 134 billion of investments primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value we exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together net of income tax effects as a separate component in shareholders’ equity we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2007 our investments had gross unrealized gains of 182 million and gross unrealized losses of 27 million if any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary based on analysis of relevant factors we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment’s fair value is other than temporary we analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost new information and the passage of time can change these judgments we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 

contingent liabilities 

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage if any for such matters it is possible that future results of operations for any particular 

  

quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions see “— cautionary statements” for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation 

legal matters 

a description of our legal proceedings is included in note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein 

concentrations of credit risk 

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base as of december 31 2007 we had an aggregate 20 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005 we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery as of december 31 2007 there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk

cautionary statements relating to our historical stock option practices 

matters relating to or arising out of our historical stock option practices including regulatory inquiries litigation matters and potential additional cash and noncash charges could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in early 2006 our board of directors initiated an independent review of the company’s historical stock option practices from 1994 to 2005 the independent review was conducted by an independent committee comprised of three independent directors of the company independent committee with the assistance of independent counsel and independent accounting advisors on october 15 2006 we announced that the independent committee had completed their review of the company’s historical stock option practices and reported the findings to the nonmanagement directors of the company as a result of our historical stock option practices we restated our previously filed financial statements we are subject to various regulatory inquiries and litigation matters and we may be subject to further cash and noncash charges the outcome of any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory inquiries 

as previously disclosed the sec and the us attorney for the southern district of new york are conducting investigations into the company’s historical stock option practices and the company has received requests for documents from the minnesota attorney general and various congressional committees in connection with these issues and the company’s executive compensation practices we have not resolved these matters we cannot provide assurance that the company will not be subject to adverse publicity regulatory or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions or contingent liabilities or adverse customer reactions in connection with these matters in addition we may be subject to additional regulatory inquiries arising out of the review of the independent committee the review of a special litigation committee consisting of two former minnesota supreme court justices appointed by our board of directors to review claims asserted in federal and state shareholder derivative claims relating to our historical stock option practices special litigation committee and the related restatement of our historical financial statements regulatory inquiries may be time consuming expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business the adverse resolution of any regulatory inquiry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

litigation matters 

we and certain of our current and former directors and officers are defendants in a consolidated federal securities class action an employment retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa class action and state and federal shareholder derivative actions relating to our historical stock option practices we also have received shareholder demands relating to those practices 

in addition following our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2006 we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our 58 senior unsecured notes due march 15 2036 alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities 

we cannot provide assurance that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these proceedings and shareholder demands 

in addition we may be subject to additional litigation proceedings or actions arising out of the independent committee’s review the special litigation committee’s review and the related restatement of our historical financial statements litigation regulatory proceedings or actions may be time consuming expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or any potential regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

potential additional cash and noncash charges 

while we believe we have made appropriate judgments in our restated financial statements in determining the financial impacts of our historical stock option practices we cannot provide assurance that the sec will agree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported or not reported the financial impacts including the adjustments that we made based on our determination of the measurement dates for our historical stock option grants if the sec disagrees with our financial adjustments and such disagreement results in material changes to our historical financial statements we may have to further restate our prior financial statements amend prior filings with the sec or take other actions not currently contemplated 

in addition other adjustments for nonoperating cash charges may be required in connection with the resolution of stock optionrelated matters arising under litigation and the abovereferenced regulatory reviews the amount and timing of which are uncertain but which could be material 

cautionary statements relating to our business 

if we fail to effectively estimate and manage our health care costs the profitability of our riskbased products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results 

under our riskbased product arrangements we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased products comprise approximately 90 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our riskbased products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage health care costs total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically fixed for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed contract period however medical cost inflation regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if medical costs increased by 1 without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products our annual net earnings for 2007 would have been reduced by approximately 190 million in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding if these estimates prove too low they will have a negative impact on our future results 

if we fail to comply with or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in federal and state regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change the broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering those regulations as well as future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions including integration of certain acquisitions delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 

  

we participate in federal state and local government health care coverage programs these programs generally are subject to frequent change including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may do so in the future 

state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business including contracting with physicians hospitals and other health care professionals physician reimbursement methods and payment rates coverage determinations mandated benefits and minimum medical expenditures claim payments and processing drug utilization and patient safety efforts use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information medical malpractice litigation consumerdriven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms confidentiality of health information and governmentsponsored programs for example from time to time congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which if adopted could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under erisa additionally there have been legislative attempts to limit erisa’s preemptive effect on state laws if adopted such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law or if enacted what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be but their enactment could increase our costs expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 

in addition the health care industry is subject to negative publicity negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services requiring us to change our products and services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate 

in august 2007 we entered into a multistate national agreement with regulatory offices in 38 states relating to the legacy unitedhealthcare fully insured commercial business the agreement covers several key areas of review of our business operations including claims payment accuracy and timeliness appeals and grievances resolution timeliness health care professional networkservice utilization review explanation of benefits accuracy and oversight and due diligence of contracted entities and vendor performance the agreement addressed and resolved past regulatory matters related to the areas of review prior to august 2007 and establishes a transparent framework for evaluating and regulating performance through december 2010 on a prospective basis the agreement is similar to a customer performance guarantee whereby we will self report quarterly and annually our operational performance on a set of national performance standards agreed to by the participating states we must perform to the standards set forth in the agreement or be subject to fines and penalties 

we are also involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these regulatory activities include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general the office of the inspector general the office of personnel management the office of civil rights the us department of justice us attorneys the sec and other governmental authorities reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions which can result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs for example in 2007 the california department of managed health care and the california department of insurance examined our pacificare health plans in california as a result of these examinations the california department of managed health care has assessed a penalty of 35 million related to its findings the california department of insurance however has not yet levied a financial penalty related to its findings in addition public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services 

  

our business providing pbm services are subject to federal and state regulations associated with the pbm industry and if we fail to comply with these regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in connection with the pacificare merger we acquired a pbm business prescription solutions we also provide pbm services through unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions prescription solutions and unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions are subject to federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers customers and consumers in addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies in the event a court were to determine that our pbm business acts as a fiduciary under erisa we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies preferred drug listings and drug management programs contracting network practices specialty drug distribution and other transactions our pbm business also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pbm subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties we also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate for our health care services segment competitors include aetna inc cigna corporation coventry health care inc health net inc humana inc kaiser permanente wellpoint inc numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare specialty services for our prescription solutions business competitors include medco health solutions inc cvscaremark corporation and express scripts inc our optumhealth and ingenix business segments also compete with a number of other businesses the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors in particular markets competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage greater market share established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangements existing business relationships and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals physician groups and other care professionals in these industries consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or to maintain or advance profitability if we do not complete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

a reduction or less than expected increase in medicare and medicaid program funding andor our failure to retain and acquire medicare medicaid and state medicaid children’s health insurance programs schip enrollees could adversely affect our revenues and financial results 

we participate as a payer in medicare advantage medicare part d and various medicaid and schip programs and receive revenues from the medicare medicaid and schip programs to provide benefits under these programs our participation in these programs is through bids that are submitted periodically revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms funding for these programs is dependent upon 

  

many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and financial results 

our ability to retain and acquire medicare medicaid and schip enrollees is impacted by bids and plan designs submitted by us and our competitors under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans under the medicare part d program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold which is set by the government after our bids are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold we risk losing the members who were autoassigned to us and we will not have additional members autoassigned to us for example we lost approximately 650000 of our autoenrolled lowincome subsidy members in 2008 because our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government in general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect or our competitors’ bids and positioning are different than anticipated either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or otherwise our financial results could be materially affected 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers our business could be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for competitive prices and services our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services in any particular market these physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

in addition we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers under the typical arrangement the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member under some capitated arrangements the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

  

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 

the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and in health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as such term is defined in the hipaa regulations even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates we still have limited control over their actions and practices in addition despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events compliance with any privacy proposals requirements and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information whether by us or by one of our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations 

our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

under our agreements with aarp we provide aarpbranded medicare supplement insurance hospital indemnity insurance and other products to aarp members and medicare part d prescription drug plans to aarp members and nonmembers one of our agreements with aarp expands the relationship to include aarpbranded medicare advantage plans for aarp members and nonmembers our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance corporate social responsibility diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances including depending on the agreement a material breach by either party insolvency of either party a material adverse change in the financial condition of the company material changes in the medicare programs material harm to aarp caused by the company and by mutual agreement the success of our aarp arrangements depends in part on our ability to service aarp and its members develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively meet our corporate governance corporate social responsibility and diversity commitments and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

because of the nature of our business we are routinely subject to various litigation actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages 

periodically we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims shareholder suits and intellectual propertyrelated litigation in addition because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings these matters include among others claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees customers and contracted and noncontracted physicians hospitals and other health care professionals medical malpractice actions contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups 

  

we are largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages in some circumstances are not covered by insurance we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters however it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 

a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems our business could be materially adversely affected 

our ability to adequately price our products and services to provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of technology initiatives changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been taking steps to consolidate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer patterns if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals have regulatory problems have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences in addition failure to consolidate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and operating results 

if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products our ability to market our knowledge and informationrelated businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trademarks trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired our results of operations shareholders’ equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected 

due largely to our recent acquisitions goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately 186 billion as of december 31 2007 representing approximately 37 of our total assets if we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could in turn negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 

  

our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders downgrades in our ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially adversely affect our financial results 

fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rates affects our returns on and the market value of fixed income and short term investments which comprise the majority of the fair value of our investments at december 31 2007 in addition defaults by issuers primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds who fail to pay or perform on their obligations could reduce our investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses as we may be required to write down the value of our investments which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders’ equity 

we also invest a smaller proportion of our investments in equity investments which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments general economic conditions stock market conditions and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses

americhoice’s approach is grounded in its belief that health care cannot be provided effectively without consideration of all of the factors—social economic and environmental as well as physical—that affect a person’s life americhoice coordinates resources among family members physicians other health care providers and government and communitybased agencies and organizations to provide continuous and effective care for members this means that the americhoice personal care model offers them a holistic approach to health care emphasizing practical programs to improve their living circumstances as well as quality medical care and treatment in accessible culturally sensitive communityoriented settings americhoice’s disease management and outreach programs focus on highprevalence and debilitating illnesses such as hypertension and

americhoice considers a variety of factors in determining in which state programs to participate including the state’s experience and consistency of support for its medicaid program in terms of service innovation and funding the population base in the state the willingness of the physicianprovider community to participate with the americhoice personal care model and the presence of communitybased organizations that can partner with americhoice to meet the needs of its members using these criteria americhoice entered one new market in 2005 signed an agreement to enter another new market in 2006 and is examining several others conversely during the past three years americhoice has exited several markets because of reimbursement issues or lack of consistent direction and support from the sponsoring states

government regulation 

  

most of our health and wellbeing services are regulated this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 

  

federal regulation 

  

our health care services segment which includes unitedhealthcare ovations and americhoice is subject to federal regulation ovations’ medicare business is regulated by cms cms has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to medicare beneficiaries our health care services segment also has medicaid and state children’s health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services and other aspects of these programs there are many regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance in addition because a portion of ingenix’s business includes clinical research it is subject to regulation by the food and drug administration we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations 

  

state regulation 

  

all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and health maintenance organization products regulate those products and operations these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates in addition some of our business and related activities may be subject to preferred provider organization ppo managed care organization mco or thirdparty administratorrelated regulations and licensure requirements these regulations differ from state to state but may contain network contracting product and rate financial and reporting requirements there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services payment of claims fraud prevention protection of consumer health information and covered benefits and services we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations 

  

as typically occurs in connection with a transaction of this size in connection with the pacificare transaction certain of our subsidiaries entered into various commitments with state regulatory departments principally in california we believe that none of these commitments will materially affect our operations 

  

hipaa 

  

the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended hipaa apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets including selffunded employee benefit plans federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations new standards for national provider and employer identifiers are currently being implemented by regulators we have been and intend to remain in compliance in all material respects with these regulations additionally different approaches to hipaa’s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 

  

erisa 

  

the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employersponsored health benefit plans erisa is a set of laws and 

  

regulations subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor as well as the federal courts erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans particularly those that maintain selffunded plans we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable erisa regulations 

  

audits and investigations 

  

we typically have and are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments state attorneys general the office of the inspector general the office of personnel management the office of civil rights the department of justice and us attorneys such government actions can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations audits or reviews individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

international regulation 

  

some of our business units have limited international operations these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions including various tax tariff and trade regulations as well as employment intellectual property and investment rules and laws we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws

2005 results compared to 2004 results 

  

consolidated financial results 

  

revenues 

  

revenues consist of premium revenues from riskbased products service revenues which primarily include fees for management administrative and consulting services and investment and other income 

  

premium revenues are primarily derived from riskbased health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed typically for a oneyear period and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care services and related administrative costs service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that selfinsure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents for both 

  

premium riskbased and feebased customer arrangements we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services transaction processing customer consumer and care provider services and access to contracted networks of physicians hospitals and other health care professionals 

  

consolidated revenues in 2005 increased by 81 billion or 22 to 454 billion excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004 consolidated revenues increased by approximately 11 in 2005 primarily as a result of rate increases on premiumbased and feebased services and growth in individuals served across business segments following is a discussion of 2005 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components 

  

premium revenues consolidated premium revenues totaled 411 billion in 2005 an increase of 76 billion or 23 over 2004 excluding the impact of acquisitions consolidated premium revenues increased by approximately 11 over 2004 this increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases and a modest increase in the number of individuals served by our riskbased products 

  

unitedhealthcare premium revenues increased by 51 billion or 24 over 2004 excluding premium revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004 unitedhealthcare premium revenues increased by approximately 9 over 2004 this increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of approximately 8 to 9 on unitedhealthcare’s renewing commercial riskbased products in addition ovations premium revenues increased by 18 billion or 24 over 2004 excluding the impact of acquisitions ovations premium revenues increased by approximately 20 over 2004 driven primarily by an increase in the number of individuals served by medicare advantage products and by medicare supplement products provided to aarp members as well as rate increases on these products premium revenues from americhoice’s medicaid programs increased by approximately 270 million or 9 over 2004 driven primarily by premium rate increases the remaining premium revenue increase is due mainly to strong growth in the number of individuals served by several specialized care services businesses under premiumbased arrangements 

  

service revenues service revenues in 2005 totaled 38 billion an increase of 473 million or 14 over 2004 the increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 8 in the number of individuals served by uniprise and unitedhealthcare under feebased arrangements during 2005 excluding the impact of acquisitions as well as annual rate increases in addition ingenix service revenues increased by more than 20 due to growth in the health information and clinical research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004 

  

investment and other income investment and other income totaled 499 million representing an increase of 111 million over 2004 interest income increased by 126 million in 2005 principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixedincome investments during the year due to the acquisitions of oxford and mamsi as well as higher yields on fixedincome investments net capital gains on sales of investments were 4 million in 2005 a decrease of 15 million from 2004 

  

medical costs 

  

the combination of pricing benefit designs consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues the consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 806 in 2004 to 797 in 2005 excluding the aarp business 1  

  

  

 the medical care ratio decreased from 795 in 2004 to 786 in 2005 these medical care ratio decreases resulted primarily from changes in product business and customer mix and an increase in favorable medical cost development related to prior periods 

  

each period our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year medical costs for 2005 include approximately 400 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years medical costs for 2004 include approximately 210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years the increase in favorable medical cost development in 2005 was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical costs as well as growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004 

  

on an absolute dollar basis 2005 medical costs increased 57 billion or 21 over 2004 excluding the impact of acquisitions medical costs increased by approximately 9 driven primarily by a 7 to 8 increase in medical cost trend due to both inflation and a slight increase in health care consumption as well as organic growth 

  

operating costs 

  

the operating cost ratio operating costs as a percentage of total revenues for 2005 was 150 down from 154 in 2004 this decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of feebased revenues additionally the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives 

  

on an absolute dollar basis operating costs for 2005 increased 11 billion or 19 over 2004 excluding the impact of acquisitions operating costs increased by approximately 11 this increase was driven by an 8 increase in total individuals served by health care services and uniprise during 2005 excluding the impact of acquisitions growth in specialized care services and ingenix and general operating cost inflation partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization in 2005 was 453 million an increase of 79 million or 21 over 2004 approximately 32 million of this increase was related to intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions since the beginning of 2004 the remaining increase is primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 357 in 2005 compared to 349 in 2004 the increase was mainly driven by favorable settlements of prior year tax returns during 2004 excluding these settlements the 2004 effective tax rate would have been approximately the same as the 2005 effective tax rate

health care services earnings from operations in 2005 were 38 billion representing an increase of 10 billion or 36 over 2004 this increase primarily resulted from revenue growth and improved gross margins on unitedhealthcare’s riskbased products increases in the number of individuals served by unitedhealthcare’s commercial feebased products and the acquisitions of oxford and mamsi during 2004 unitedhealthcare’s commercial medical care ratio decreased to 782 in 2005 from 790 in 2004 mainly due to changes in product business and customer mix health care services’ 2005 operating margin was 95 an

excluding the pacificare acquisition the number of individuals served by ovations’ medicare advantage products increased by 65000 or 20 over 2004 due primarily to new customer relationships americhoice’s medicaid enrollment decreased by 10000 from 2004 due primarily to the withdrawal of participation in one market during the third quarter of 2005 partially offset by new customer relationships since 2004

investment and other income investment and other income totaled 388 million representing an increase of 131 million over 2003 interest income increased by 134 million in 2004 principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixedincome investments during the year from the acquisitions of oxford mamsi and golden rule financial corporation golden rule which was acquired in november 2003 net capital gains on sales of investments were 19 million in 2004 a decrease of 3 million from 2003 

  

medical costs 

  

the consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 814 in 2003 to 806 in 2004 excluding the aarp business the medical care ratio decreased from 800 in 2003 to 795 in 2004 the medical care ratio decrease resulted primarily from net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in product business and customer mix 

  

each period our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year medical costs for 2004 include approximately 210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years medical costs for 2003 include approximately 150 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 

  

on an absolute dollar basis 2004 medical costs increased 63 billion or 30 over 2003 principally due to the impact of the acquisitions of oxford mamsi and golden rule excluding the impact of acquisitions medical costs increased by approximately 8 driven primarily by medical cost inflation and a moderate increase in health care consumption 

  

operating costs 

  

the operating cost ratio for 2004 was 154 down from 169 in 2003 this decrease was driven by revenue mix changes with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions the existence of premium revenues within our riskbased products cause them to have lower operating cost ratios than feebased products which have no premium revenues additionally the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives 

  

on an absolute dollar basis operating costs for 2004 increased 868 million or 18 over 2003 primarily due to the acquisitions of oxford mamsi and golden rule excluding the impact of acquisitions operating costs increased by approximately 3 this increase was driven by a more than 3 increase in the total number of individuals served by health care services and uniprise in 2004 excluding the impact of acquisitions and general operating cost inflation partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization in 2004 was 374 million an increase of 75 million or 25 over 2003 approximately 42 million of this increase is related to intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions in 2004 the remaining increase is due primarily to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 349 in 2004 compared to 357 in 2003 the decrease was driven mainly by favorable settlements of prior year income tax returns during 2004

health care services 

  

health care services had revenues of 327 billion in 2004 representing an increase of 79 billion or 32 over 2003 driven primarily by acquisitions since the beginning of 2003 excluding the impact of acquisitions health care services revenues increased by approximately 19 billion or 8 over 2003 unitedhealthcare accounted for approximately 850 million of this increase driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 9 on renewing commercial riskbased business and growth in the number of individuals served by feebased products partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by unitedhealthcare’s commercial riskbased products ovations contributed approximately 770 million to the revenue advance over 2003 driven by growth in the number of individuals served by ovations’ medicare advantage products and changes in product mix related to medicare supplement products it provides to aarp members as well as rate increases on all of these products the remaining increase in health care services revenues is attributable to growth in the number of individuals served by americhoice’s medicaid programs and medicaid premium rate increases 

  

health care services earnings from operations in 2004 were 28 billion representing an increase of 945 million or 51 over 2003 this increase primarily resulted from ovations’ and unitedhealthcare’s revenue growth improved gross margins on unitedhealthcare’s commercial riskbased products and the impact of the acquisitions of oxford mamsi and golden rule unitedhealthcare’s commercial medical care ratio decreased to 790 in 2004 from 800 in 2003 the decrease in the commercial medical care ratio was primarily driven by net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in business and customer mix health care services’ 2004 operating margin was 86 an increase of 110 basis 

  

points over 2003 this increase was principally driven by a combination of the improved commercial medical care ratio and changes in business and customer mix 

  

the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by health care services by major market segment and funding arrangement as of december 31 1  

  

    

the number of individuals served by unitedhealthcare’s commercial business as of december 31 2004 increased by nearly 27 million or 32 over the prior year excluding the 2004 acquisitions of oxford mamsi and a smaller regional health plan the number of individuals served by unitedhealthcare’s commercial business increased by 245000 this included an increase of 285000 in the number of individuals served with feebased products driven by new customer relationships and existing customers converting from riskbased products to feebased products partially offset by a decrease of 40000 in the number of individuals served with riskbased products resulting primarily from customers converting to selffunded feebased arrangements and a competitive commercial riskbased pricing environment 

  

excluding the impact of the oxford acquisition the number of individuals served by ovations’ medicare advantage products increased by 30000 or 13 from 2003 americhoice’s medicaid enrollment increased by 155000 or 14 due to organic growth in the number of individuals served and the acquisition of a medicaid health plan in michigan in february 2004 resulting in the addition of approximately 95000 individuals served 

  

uniprise 

  

uniprise revenues in 2004 were 34 billion representing an increase of 8 over 2003 this increase was driven primarily by growth of 4 in the number of individuals served by uniprise excluding the impact of acquisitions and annual service fee rate increases for selfinsured customers uniprise served 99 million individuals and 91 million individuals as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

uniprise earnings from operations in 2004 were 677 million representing an increase of 11 over 2003 operating margin for 2004 improved to 201 from 196 in 2003 uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service billing and enrollment functions 

  

specialized care services 

  

specialized care services revenues during 2004 of 23 billion increased by 417 million or 22 over 2003 this increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by its behavioral health benefits business its dental services business and its vision care benefits business rate increases related to these businesses and incremental revenues related to businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003 of approximately 100 million 

  

earnings from operations in 2004 of 485 million increased 100 million or 26 over 2003 specialized care services’ operating margin increased to 211 in 2004 up from 205 in 2003 this increase was driven primarily by operational and productivity improvements within specialized care services’ businesses and consolidation of the production and service operation infrastructure to enhance productivity and efficiency and to improve the quality and consistency of service partially offset by a business mix shift toward higher revenue lower margin products 

  

ingenix 

  

ingenix revenues in 2004 of 670 million increased by 96 million or 17 over 2003 this was driven primarily by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses earnings from operations in 2004 were 129 million up 54 million or 72 from 2003 operating margin was 193 in 2004 up from 131 in 2003 the increase in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to growth and improving gross margins in the health information and clinical research businesses 

  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources at december 31 2005 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we manage our cash investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and longterm obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity we forecast analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 

  

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash cash equivalents and investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our shortterm obligations in longer term investmentgrade marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors’ approved investment policy regulatory limitations return objectives tax implications risk tolerance and maturity dates our longterm investments are also available for sale to meet shortterm liquidity and other needs cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities are paid to their nonregulated parent companies typically in the form of dividends for general corporate use when and as permitted by applicable regulations 

  

our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with the issuance of commercial paper longterm debt and the availability of committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions and to repurchase shares of our common stock depending on market conditions 

  

cash flows generated from operating activities our primary source of liquidity are principally from net earnings prior to depreciation and amortization as a result any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity the level of profitability of our riskbased insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses the geographic diversity of our riskbased business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs in 2005 a hypothetical unexpected 1 increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately 130 million 

  

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels debt ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and market conditions we believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk 

  

cash and investments 

  

cash flows from operating activities were 43 billion in 2005 an increase over 41 billion in 2004 the increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of 834 million in net income prior to depreciation amortization and other noncash items partially offset by a decrease of 643 million in cash flows generated from working capital changes we generated operating cash flows from working capital changes of 406 million in 2005 and 1049 million in 2004 the yearoveryear decrease primarily resulted from the company receiving only eleven monthly medicare premium payments during 2005 from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms rather than the twelve monthly payments received in 2004 negatively impacting the change in reported operating cash flows by 375 million additionally there was reduced growth in medical payables during 2005 compared to 2004 due in part to an increase in electronic claim submissions and other disbursement process efficiencies 

  

we maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position with cash and investments of 150 billion at december 31 2005 total cash and investments increased by 27 billion since december 31 2004 primarily due to cash and investments acquired through businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005 strong operating cash flows and cash received from debt issuances partially offset by common stock repurchases cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures 

  

as further described under regulatory capital and dividend restrictions many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies at december 31 2005 approximately 270 million of our 150 billion of cash and investments was held by nonregulated subsidiaries and available for general corporate use including acquisitions and share repurchases 

  

financing and investing activities 

  

in addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities we use commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately 71 billion and 40 billion respectively our debttototalcapital ratio was 286 and 273 as of december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively we believe the prudent use of debt leverage optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders’ equity while maintaining appropriate liquidity 

  

on december 20 2005 the company acquired pacificare under the terms of the agreement pacificare shareholders received 11 shares of unitedhealth group common stock and 2150 in cash for each share of pacificare common stock they owned total consideration issued for the transaction was approximately 88 billion composed of approximately 992 million shares of unitedhealth group common stock valued at approximately 53 billion based upon the average of unitedhealth group’s share closing price for two days before the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of july 6 2005 approximately 21 billion in cash 960 million cash paid to retire pacificare’s existing debt and unitedhealth group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of approximately 420 million issued in exchange for pacificare’s outstanding vested common stock options

in november and december 2005 we issued 26 billion of commercial paper primarily to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of the pacificare acquisition described above and to retire a portion of the pacificare debt at the closing of the acquisition as well as to refinance current maturities of longterm debt as of december 31 2005 our outstanding commercial paper had interest rates ranging from 42 to 44 

  

in march 2005 we issued 500 million of 49 fixedrate notes due march 2015 we used the proceeds from this borrowing for general corporate purposes including repayment of commercial paper capital expenditures working capital and share repurchases 

  

in july 2004 we issued 12 billion of commercial paper to fund the cash portion of the oxford purchase price in august 2004 we refinanced the commercial paper by issuing 550 million of 34 fixedrate notes due august 2007 450 million of 41 fixedrate notes due august 2009 and 500 million of 50 fixedrate notes due august 2014 

  

in february 2004 we issued 250 million of 38 fixedrate notes due february 2009 and 250 million of 48 fixedrate notes due february 2014 we used the proceeds from the february 2004 borrowings to finance a majority of the cash portion of the mamsi purchase price as described above 

  

to more closely align interest costs with the floating interest rate received on our cash and cash equivalent balances we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a variable rate these interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges the interest rate swap agreements have aggregate notional amounts of 34 billion with variable rates that are benchmarked to the london interbank offered rate libor at december 31 2005 the rate used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 43 to 50 the differential between the fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

  

in december 2005 we amended and restated our 10 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program we increased the capacity to 13 billion and extended the maturity date to december 2010 in october 2005 we executed a 30 billion 364day revolving credit facility to support a 30 billion increase in our commercial paper program as of december 31 2005 we had no amounts outstanding under either of these credit facilities 

  

pacificare had approximately 100 million par value of 3 convertible subordinated debentures convertible notes which were convertible into approximately 52 million shares of unitedhealth group’s common stock and 102 million of cash as of december 31 2005 in december 2005 we initiated a consent solicitation to all of the holders of outstanding convertible notes pursuant to which we offered to compensate all holders who elected to convert their notes in accordance with existing terms and consent to an amendment to a covenant in the indenture 

  

governing the convertible notes the compensation consisted of the present value of interest through october 18 2007 the earliest mandatory redemption date plus a pro rata share of 1 million on january 31 2006 approximately 91 of the convertible notes were tendered pursuant to the offer for which we issued 48 million shares of unitedhealth group common stock and cash of 99 million 

  

our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debttototalcapital ratio calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper debt and shareholders’ equity below 45 and to exceed specified minimum interest coverage levels we are in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants 

  

our senior debt is rated “a” by standard  poor’s sp and fitch and “a2” by moody’s our commercial paper is rated “a1” by sp “f1” by fitch and “p1” by moody’s consistent with our intention of maintaining our senior debt ratings in the “a” range we currently intend to maintain our debttototalcapital ratio at approximately 30 or less a significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs 

  

under our board of directors’ authorization we maintain a common stock repurchase program repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices subject to certain restrictions on volume pricing and timing during the year ended december 31 2005 we repurchased 536 million shares at an average price of approximately 48 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately 26 billion as of december 31 2005 we had board of directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 555 million shares of our common stock our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares we repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital a decision by the company to discontinue share repurchases would significantly increase our liquidity and financial flexibility 

  

we currently have a 40 billion universal s3 shelf registration statement for common stock preferred stock debt securities and other securities which has been declared effective by the sec in addition we are considered a “well known seasoned issuer” under the securities offering reform act that became effective in december 2005 we have not yet issued any securities under this shelf registration statement we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of offering we intend to issue debt securities during the first quarter of 2006 to refinance some or all of the commercial paper currently outstanding under our s4 acquisition shelf registration statement we have remaining issuing capacity of 486 million shares of our common stock in connection with acquisition activities we filed separate s4 registration statements for the 728 million shares issued in connection with the february 2004 acquisition of mamsi the 1044 million shares issued in connection with the july 2004 acquisition of oxford and the 992 million shares issued in connection with the december 2005 acquisition of pacificare described previously 

  

contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2005 under our various contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and commitments in millions 

  

    

   

   

   

   

currently we do not have any other material contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations this includes internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

  

aarp 

  

in january 1998 we entered into a 10year contract to provide health insurance products and services to members of aarp these products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional medicare under the terms of the contract we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk we are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program premium revenues from our portion of the aarp insurance offerings were approximately 49 billion in 2005 45 billion in 2004 and 41 billion in 2003 

  

the underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund rsf the primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue medical costs investment income administrative expenses member services expenses marketing expenses and premium taxes underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the rsf and accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the rsf to the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the rsf we would have to fund the deficit any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract to date we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits as further described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the rsf balance is reported in other policy liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets we believe the rsf balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract 

  

medicare part d pharmacy benefits contract 

  

the company has contracted with the centers for medicare  medicaid services to serve as a prescription drug plan sponsor offering medicare part d prescription drug insurance coverage to eligible medicare beneficiaries beginning january 1 2006 this product is either offered as a standalone product or as an element of the medicare advantage products 

  

as a result of this contract and the december 2005 acquisition of pacificare premium revenues from medicarerelated programs which have historically been approximately 10 of total premium revenues are expected to increase to approximately 25 in 2006 

  

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our operations through companies that are subject to standards established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus the agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider capital adequacy levels when establishing our debt ratings consistent with our intent to maintain our senior debt ratings in the “a” range we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require as of december 31 2005 our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital of approximately 64 billion which is significantly more than the aggregate minimum regulatory requirements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we believe our most critical accounting policies are those described below for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

medical costs 

  

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption provider contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care provider and type of service the typical billing lag for services can range from two to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to 12 months from the date of service we estimate liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 

  

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as more complete claim information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the 

  

period in which the change is identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development historically the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1 of annual medical costs less than 5 of annual earnings from operations and less than 4 of medical costs payable 

  

in order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations in millions 

  

    

   

   

our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of the company’s liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2005 developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the company’s liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2005 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates the increase in favorable medical cost development in 2005 was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical costs as well as growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004 assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2005 estimates of medical costs payable and actual costs payable excluding the aarp business 2005 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by 63 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by 003 per share 

  

contingent liabilities 

  

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverages if any for such matters we do not believe any matters currently threatened or pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 

  

goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets property equipment and capitalized software of 199 billion we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the 

  

reporting unit level and we review our remaining longlived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value to determine the fair value of our longlived assets and assess their recoverability we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues expenses and operating margins if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 

  

revenues 

  

revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services as recorded in our records employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing we estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly our estimates are based on historical trends premiums billed the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 

  

investments 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 96 billion of investments primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value we exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together net of income tax effects as a separate component in shareholders’ equity we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2005 our investments had gross unrealized gains of 105 million and gross unrealized losses of 53 million if any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary based on analysis of relevant factors we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment’s fair value is other than temporary new information and the passage of time can change these judgments we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known and record any resulting impairment charges at that time we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 

  

inflation 

  

the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation these include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers through contracts with physicians and other health care providers we emphasize preventive health care appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards education and closing gaps in care 

  

we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful however other factors including competitive pressures new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers major epidemics and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation because of the narrow operating margins of our riskbased products changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 

  

legal matters 

  

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings we record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters these matters include but are not limited to claims relating to health care benefits coverage medical malpractice actions contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 

  

beginning in 1999 a series of class action lawsuits were filed against both unitedhealthcare and pacificare and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business in december 2000 a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving unitedhealth group and our affiliates including pacificare in the southern district court of florida miami division generally the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered the consolidated suits seek injunctive compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution costs fees and interest payments the trial court granted the health care providers’ motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the eleventh circuit court of appeals the eleventh circuit affirmed the class action status of the rico claims but reversed as to the breach of contract unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims during the course of the litigation there have been codefendant settlements through a series of motions and appeals all direct claims against us have been compelled to arbitration a trial date has been set for september 2006 the trial court has ordered that the trial be split into separate liability and damage proceedings in august 2005 the capitationrelated claims were dismissed from litigation on january 31 2006 the trial court dismissed all remaining claims against pacificare a march 14 2006 hearing date has been scheduled for our summary judgment motion 

  

on march 15 2000 the american medical association filed a lawsuit against the company in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york on april 13 2000 we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york the suit alleges causes of action based on erisa as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing deceptive acts and practices and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for nonnetwork providers the suit seeks declaratory injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs fees and interest payments an amended complaint was filed on august 25 2000 which alleged two classes of plaintiffs an erisa class and a nonerisa class after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by the american medical association a third amended complaint was filed on october 25 2002 the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint on may 21 2003 we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the american medical association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff on may 26 2004 we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based in part due to lack of standing on july 16 2004 plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint seeking to assert rico violations 

  

although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain we do not believe the results of any such actions currently threatened or pending including those described above will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

  

market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices the company’s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and longterm debt 

  

approximately 147 billion of our cash equivalents and investments at december 31 2005 were debt securities assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixedincome investment portfolio at december 31 2005 the fair value of our fixedincome investments would decrease or increase by approximately 345 million we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 

  

to mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our longterm debt with those of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements approximately 62 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and approximately 09 billion had fixed rates as of december 31 2005 a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt 

  

at december 31 2005 we had 261 million of equity investments a portion of which were held by our unitedhealth capital business in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio 

  

concentrations of credit risk 

  

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject unitedhealth group to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base as discussed more fully in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we have a 18 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our life and annuity business we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery as of december 31 2005 there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 

  

cautionary statements 

  

the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the securities and exchange commission in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words or phrases “believes” “anticipates” “expects” “plans” “seeks” “intends” “will likely result” “estimates” “projects” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements 

  

the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws we do not undertake to address or update forwardlooking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may 

  

turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results by their nature forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications 

  

we must effectively manage our health care costs 

  

under our riskbased product arrangements we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased products excluding aarp have typically comprised approximately 75 to 80 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers the profitability of our riskbased products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage health care costs total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period however inflation regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if medical costs increased by 1 without a proportional change in related revenues for unitedhealthcare’s commercial insured products our annual net earnings for 2005 would have been reduced by approximately 130 million in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding if these estimates prove too high or too low the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results that change can be either positive or negative to our results 

  

we face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors 

  

our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate for our uniprise and health care services segments competitors include aetna inc cigna corporation coventry health care inc humana inc and wellpoint inc numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas our specialized care services and ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors in particular markets competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage greater market share established reputation superior supplier or provider arrangements existing business relationships and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or to maintain or advance profitability 

  

our relationship with aarp is important 

  

under our 10year contract with aarp which commenced in 1998 we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members as of december 31 2005 our portion of aarp’s insurance program represented approximately 49 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 38 million aarp members the aarp contract may be terminated early by us or aarp under certain circumstances including a material breach by either party insolvency of either party a material 

  

adverse change in the financial condition of either party and by mutual agreement the success of our aarp arrangement depends in part on our ability to service aarp and its members develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 

  

some of the favorable and unfavorable effects of changes in medicare remain uncertain 

  

the changes in medicare as a result of the medicare modernization act of 2003 mma are complex and wideranging and continue to affect our businesses we have taken advantage of new opportunities to partner with the federal government created by the mma including medicare part d prescription drug coverage medicare advantage regional ppos and special needs plans for chronically ill medicare beneficiaries we have invested considerable resources in creating new medicare product offerings for these initiatives and in analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with these new programs and other changes arising from the mma in particular the part d program presents challenges because of the size and scope of the new program our ability to successfully participate in the part d program depends in part on coordination of information and information systems between us cms and state governments we have been working with cms to correct systems issues that they have experienced with respect to certain low income people eligible to participate in part d the inability to receive correct information due to systems issues by the federal government the applicable state government or us could adversely affect our business additionally our participation in the part d program is based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization pharmaceutical costs and other factors in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the part d program or otherwise our results could be materially affected any positive or negative results of the part d program are likely to have a significant impact on us as a result of the size of our enrollment in our part d program 

  

we are subject to funding risks with respect to revenue received from participation in medicare and medicaid programs 

  

we participate as a payer in medicare advantage part d and medicaid programs and receive revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs revenues for these programs are dependent upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state governments funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities an unexpected reduction in government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results 

  

our business is subject to routine government scrutiny and we must respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in government regulations 

  

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 

  

we participate in federal state and local government health care coverage programs these programs generally are subject to frequent change including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may do so in the future 

  

state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business including contracting with physicians hospitals and other health care professionals physician reimbursement methods and payment rates coverage determinations claim payments and processing drug utilization and patient safety efforts use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information medical malpractice litigation and governmentsponsored programs we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation or if enacted what their terms will be but their enactment could increase our costs expose us to expanded liability require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 

  

we typically are involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general the office of the inspector general the office of personnel management the office of civil rights the department of justice and us attorneys such government actions can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs in addition public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services 

  

relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers are important to our business 

  

we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for competitive prices our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws in any particular market these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 

  

in addition we have capitation arrangements with some physicians hospitals and other health care providers under the typical arrangement the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member under some capitated arrangements the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider to the extent that a capitated provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that are the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement 

  

the nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks 

  

periodically we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims shareholder suits and intellectual propertyrelated litigation in addition because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings these matters include among others claims related to health care benefits coverage medical malpractice actions contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices in 1999 a number of class action lawsuits were filed against unitedhealthcare and pacificare and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business although all claims against pacificare have been dismissed the suits are 

  

purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes including erisa and rico  in march 2000 the american medical association filed a lawsuit against us in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for nonnetwork providers although the expenses we have incurred to date in defending the 1999 class action lawsuits and the american medical association lawsuit have not been material to our business we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of these lawsuits and other matters even if they are without merit 

  

the company is largely selfinsured with regard to litigation risks however we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize risks associated with catastrophic claims although we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our selfinsurance certain types of damages such as punitive damages are not covered by insurance we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 

  

our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management pbm services face regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry that may differ from the risks of providing managed care and health insurance products 

  

in connection with the pacificare merger we acquired a pharmacy benefits management business prescription solutions we also provide pharmacy benefits management services through unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions prescription solutions and unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions are subject to federal and state antiremuneration and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers customers and consumers federal and state legislatures are considering new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt of rebates from pharmaceutical companies in addition if a court were to determine that our pbm business acts as a fiduciary under the employee retirement income security act or erisa we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies preferred drug listings and therapeutic intervention programs contracting network practices speciality drug distribution and other transactions our pbm also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations as well as risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pbm subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties we also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy 

  

our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems 

  

our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our acquisition activities we have acquired additional systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have disputes with customers physicians and other health care providers have regulatory problems have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 

  

the value of our intangible assets may become impaired 

  

due largely to our recent acquisitions goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately 182 billion as of december 31 2005 representing approximately 44 of our total assets if we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible 

  

assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could in turn negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 

  

our knowledge and informationrelated businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products 

  

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services 

  

we must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality 

  

the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also imposes guidelines on our business associates as this term is defined in the hipaa regulations even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates we still have limited control over their actions and practices compliance with these proposals requirements and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 

  

the anticipated benefits of acquiring pacificare may not be realized 

  

we acquired pacificare with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits including among others benefits relating to a stronger and more diverse network of doctors and other health care providers expanded and enhanced affordable health care services enhanced revenues a strengthened market position for unitedhealth group in the western united states crossselling opportunities technology cost savings and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether unitedhealth group integrates pacificare in an efficient and effective manner and general competitive factors in the marketplace failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and operating results

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

as of december 31 2005 an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

  

internal control over financial reporting 

  

report of management 

  

the management of unitedhealth group is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

  

   

   

   

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on our assessment and those criteria we believe that as of december 31 2005 the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 

  

management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting the internal controls of pacificare health systems inc pacificare which was acquired by the company on december 20 2005 and is included in the company’s consolidated financial statements for the period from that date through yearend such exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management’s report on internal controls over financial reporting in the year of acquisition total assets and total liabilities of 

  

pacificare represented approximately 29 and 13 respectively of the company’s consolidated assets and liabilities as of december 31 2005 and less than 1 of consolidated revenues and operating income for the year then ended 

  

changes to certain processes information technology systems and other components of internal control resulting from the acquisition of pacificare may occur and will be evaluated by management as such integration activities are implemented other than the impact of the acquisition there were no changes in internal control that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control during the year ended december 31 2005 

  

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 as stated in the report of independent registered public accounting firm appearing under item 9a which expresses unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2005

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and shareholders of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying report of management that unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in the report of management management excluded from their assessment the internal control over financial reporting at pacificare health systems inc pacificare which was acquired on december 20 2005 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting approximately 29 and 1 percent respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at pacificare the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 of the company and our report dated february 24 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

2004 results compared to 2003 results 

  

consolidated financial results 

  

revenues 

  

revenues are comprised of premium revenues from riskbased products service revenues which primarily include fees for management administrative and consulting services and investment and other income 

  

premium revenues are primarily derived from riskbased health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed typically for a oneyear period and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care services and related administrative costs service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that selfinsure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents for both premium riskbased and feebased customer arrangements we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services transaction processing customer consumer and care provider services and access to contracted networks of physicians hospitals and other health care professionals 

  

consolidated revenues increased by 84 billion or 29 in 2004 to 372 billion primarily as a result of revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003 excluding the impact of these acquisitions consolidated revenues increased by approximately 8 in 2004 as a result of rate increases on premiumbased and feebased services and growth across business segments following is a discussion of 2004 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components 

  

premium revenues consolidated premium revenues in 2004 totaled 335 billion an increase of 80 billion or 32 over 2003 excluding the impact of acquisitions premium revenues increased by approximately 8 in 2004 this increase was due in part to average net premium rate increases of approximately 9 on unitedhealthcare’s renewing commercial riskbased business partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by unitedhealthcare’s commercial riskbased products and changes in the commercial product benefit and customer mix in addition ovations’ premium revenues increased largely due to increases in the number of individuals it serves through medicare advantage products and changes in product mix related to medicare supplement products as well as rate increases on all of these products premium revenues from americhoice’s medicaid programs and specialized care services’ businesses also increased due to advances in the number of individuals served by those businesses 

  

service revenues service revenues in 2004 totaled 33 billion an increase of 217 million or 7 over 2003 the increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 4 in the number of individuals served by uniprise and unitedhealthcare under feebased arrangements during 2004 excluding the impact of acquisitions as well as annual rate increases in addition ingenix service revenues increased due to new business growth in the health information and clinical research businesses 

  

investment and other income investment and other income totaled 388 million representing an increase of 131 million over 2003 interest income increased by 134 million in 2004 principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixedincome investments during the year from the acquisitions of oxford mamsi and golden rule financial corporation golden rule which was acquired in november 2003 net capital gains on sales of investments were 19 million in 2004 a decrease of 3 million from 2003 

  

medical costs 

  

the combination of pricing benefit designs consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues 

  

the consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 814 in 2003 to 806 in 2004 excluding the aarp business 1  the medical care ratio decreased 50 basis points from 800 in 2003 to 795 in 2004 the medical care ratio decrease resulted primarily from net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in product business and customer mix 

  

each period our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year medical costs for 2004 include approximately 210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years medical costs for 2003 include approximately 150 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 

  

   

on an absolute dollar basis 2004 medical costs increased 63 billion or 30 over 2003 principally due to the impact of the acquisitions of oxford mamsi and golden rule excluding the impact of acquisitions medical costs increased by approximately 8 driven primarily by medical cost inflation and a moderate increase in health care consumption 

  

operating costs 

  

the operating cost ratio operating costs as a percentage of total revenues for 2004 was 154 down from 169 in 2003 this decrease was driven by revenue mix changes with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions the existence of premium revenues within our riskbased products cause them to have lower operating cost ratios than feebased products which have no premium revenues additionally the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives 

  

on an absolute dollar basis operating costs for 2004 increased 868 million or 18 over 2003 primarily due to the acquisitions of oxford mamsi and golden rule excluding the impact of acquisitions operating costs increased by approximately 3 this increase was driven by a more than 3 increase in the total number of individuals served by health care services and uniprise in 2004 excluding the impact of acquisitions and general operating cost inflation partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization in 2004 was 374 million an increase of 75 million or 25 over 2003 approximately 42 million of this increase is related to intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions in 2004 the remaining increase of 33 million is due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 349 in 2004 compared to 357 in 2003 the decrease was driven mainly by favorable settlements of prior year income tax returns

financial condition liquidity and capital resources at december 31 2004 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we manage our cash investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and longterm obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity we forecast analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 

  

our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash cash equivalents and investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our shortterm obligations in longer term investmentgrade marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors’ approved investment policy regulatory limitations return objectives tax implications risk tolerance and maturity dates our longterm investments are also available for sale to meet shortterm liquidity and other needs cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities are paid to their nonregulated parent companies typically in the form of dividends for general corporate use when and as permitted by applicable regulations 

  

our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use cash flows generated by these entities combined with the issuance of commercial paper longterm debt and the availability of committed credit facilities further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions and to repurchase shares of our common stock depending on market conditions 

  

cash flows generated from operating activities our primary source of liquidity are principally from net earnings excluding depreciation and amortization as a result any future decline in our profitability may have a negative 

  

impact on our liquidity the level of profitability of our riskbased business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses the geographic diversity of our riskbased business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs in 2004 a hypothetical unexpected 1 increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately 105 million 

  

the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability operating cash flows debt levels debt ratings debt covenants and other contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and market conditions we believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk 

  

cash and investments 

  

cash flows from operating activities were 41 billion in 2004 representing an increase over 2003 of 11 billion or 38 this increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of 871 million in net income excluding depreciation amortization and other noncash items additionally operating cash flows increased by 261 million due to cash generated by working capital changes driven in part by improved cash collections leading to decreases in accounts receivable and increases in unearned premiums and an increase in medical costs payable as premium revenues and related medical costs increase we generate incremental operating cash flows because we collect premium revenues in advance of the claim payments for related medical costs 

  

we maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position with cash and investments of 123 billion at december 31 2004 total cash and investments increased by 28 billion since december 31 2003 primarily due to 24 billion in cash and investments acquired in the oxford and mamsi acquisitions and strong operating cash flows partially offset by common stock repurchases cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures 

  

as further described under regulatory capital and dividend restrictions many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies at december 31 2004 approximately 227 million of our 123 billion of cash and investments was held by nonregulated subsidiaries of this amount approximately 37 million was segregated for future regulatory capital needs and the remainder was available for general corporate use including acquisitions and share repurchases 

  

financing and investing activities 

  

in addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities we use commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately 40 billion and 20 billion respectively our debttototalcapital ratio was 273 and 278 as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively we believe the prudent use of debt leverage optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders’ equity while maintaining appropriate liquidity

we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert our interest exposure on a majority of these 2003 and 2004 borrowings from a fixed to a variable rate the interest rate swap agreements on these borrowings have aggregate notional amounts of 29 billion at december 31 2004 the rate used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 23 to 33 the differential between the fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

  

in june 2004 we executed a 10 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility to support our commercial paper program this credit facility replaced our existing 450 million revolving facility that was set to expire in july 2005 and our 450 million 364day facility that was set to expire in july 2004 as of december 31 2004 we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility commercial paper increased from 79 million at december 31 2003 to 273 million at december 31 2004 

  

our debt arrangements and credit facility contain various covenants the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debttototalcapital ratio calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper debt and shareholders’ equity below 45 and to exceed specified minimum interest coverage levels we are in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants 

  

our senior debt is rated “a” by standard  poor’s sp and fitch and “a3” with a positive outlook by moody’s our commercial paper is rated “a1” by sp “f1” by fitch and “p2” with a positive outlook by moody’s consistent with our intention of maintaining our senior debt ratings in the “a” range we intend to maintain our debttototalcapital ratio at approximately 30 or less a significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs 

  

under our board of directors’ authorization we maintain a common stock repurchase program repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices subject to certain restrictions on volume pricing and timing during 2004 we repurchased 514 million shares at an average price of approximately 68 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately 35 billion as of december 31 2004 we had board of directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 546 million shares of our common stock our common stock repurchase program 

  

is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares we repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital a decision by the company to discontinue share repurchases would significantly increase our liquidity and financial flexibility 

  

under our s3 shelf registration statement for common stock preferred stock debt securities and other securities the remaining issuing capacity of all covered securities is 500 million we intend to file a new s3 shelf registration statement during the first half of 2005 to increase our remaining issuing capacity we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of offering under our s4 acquisition shelf registration statement we have remaining issuing capacity of 243 million shares of our common stock in connection with acquisition activities we filed separate s4 registration statements for the 364 million shares issued in connection with the february 2004 acquisition of mamsi and for the 522 million shares issued in connection with the july 2004 acquisition of oxford described previously 

  

contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31 2004 under our various contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and commitments in millions 

  

    

   

   

   

currently we do not have any other material contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations this includes internal development of new products programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions 

  

aarp 

  

in january 1998 we entered into a 10year contract to provide health insurance products and services to members of aarp these products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional medicare under the terms of the contract we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk we are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program premium revenues from our portion of the aarp insurance offerings were approximately 45 billion in 2004 41 billion in 2003 and 37 billion in 2002 

  

the underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund rsf the primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue medical costs investment income administrative expenses member services expenses marketing expenses and premium taxes underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the rsf and accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the 

  

rsf to the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the rsf we would have to fund the deficit any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract to date we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits as further described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the rsf balance is reported in other policy liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets we believe the rsf balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract 

  

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our operations through companies that are subject to standards established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic these standards among other things require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus the agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider capital adequacy levels when establishing our debt ratings consistent with our intent to maintain our senior debt ratings in the “a” range we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require as of december 31 2004 our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital of approximately 41 billion which is significantly more than the aggregate minimum regulatory requirements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging subjective or complex judgments often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we believe our most critical accounting policies are those described below for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

medical costs 

  

each reporting period we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied centrally controlled and automated the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt claim backlogs seasonal variances in medical care consumption provider contract rate changes medical care utilization and other medical cost trends membership volume and demographics benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products customers and geography depending on the health care provider and type of service the typical billing lag for services can range from two to 90 days from the date of service substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to 12 months from the date of service we estimate liabilities for physician hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 

  

each period we reexamine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances as the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact we increase or decrease the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified in every reporting period our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable 

  

development historically the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than onehalf of 1 of annual medical costs less than 4 of annual earnings from operations and less than 3 of medical costs payable 

  

in order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations in millions 

  

    

   

   

our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of the company’s liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31 2004 developed using consistently applied actuarial methods management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the company’s liability for unpaid claims as of december 31 2004 however actual claim payments may differ from established estimates assuming a hypothetical 1 difference between our december 31 2004 estimates of medical costs payable and actual costs payable excluding the aarp business 2004 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by 46 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by approximately 005 per share 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets property equipment and capitalized software of 118 billion we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and we review our remaining longlived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value to determine the fair value of the respective assets and assess the recoverability of our longlived assets we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues expenses and operating margins if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 

  

investments 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 83 billion of investments primarily held in marketable debt securities our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value we exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together net of income tax effects as a separate component in shareholders’ equity we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments as of december 31 2004 our investments had gross unrealized gains of 215 million and gross unrealized losses of 11 million if any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary based on analysis of relevant factors we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment’s fair value is other than temporary new information and the 

  

passage of time can change these judgments we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known and record any resulting impairment charges at that time we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 

  

revenues 

  

revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services as recorded in our records employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing we estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly our estimates are based on historical trends premiums billed the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 

  

contingent liabilities 

  

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely involved in various disputes legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverages if any for such matters we do not believe any matters currently threatened or pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 

  

inflation 

  

the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation these include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers through contracts with physicians and other health care providers we emphasize preventive health care appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards education and closing gaps in care 

  

we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful however other factors including competitive pressures new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers major epidemics and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation because of the narrow operating margins of our riskbased products changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 

  

legal matters 

  

because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design management and offerings of our services we record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters these matters include but are not limited to claims relating to health care benefits coverage medical malpractice actions contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices following the events of september 11 2001 the cost of business insurance coverage increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business 

  

in re managed care litigation mdl no 1334 beginning in 1999 a series of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business in december 2000 a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving unitedhealth group and our affiliates in the southern district court of florida miami division generally the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of erisa and rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered the consolidated suits seek injunctive compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution costs fees and interest payments the trial court granted the health care providers’ motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the eleventh circuit court of appeals the eleventh circuit affirmed the class action status of the rico claims but reversed as to the breach of contract unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims through a series of motions and appeals all direct claims against unitedhealthcare have been compelled to arbitration the trial court has denied unitedhealthcare’s further motion to compel the secondary rico claims to arbitration and the eleventh circuit affirmed that order a trial date has been set for september 2005 the trial court has ordered that the trial be bifurcated into separate liability and damage proceedings 

  

the american medical association et al v metropolitan life insurance company united healthcare services inc and unitedhealth group on march 15 2000 the american medical association filed a lawsuit against the company in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york on april 13 2000 we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york the suit alleges causes of action based on erisa as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing deceptive acts and practices and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for nonnetwork providers the suit seeks declaratory injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs fees and interest payments an amended complaint was filed on august 25 2000 which alleged two classes of plaintiffs an erisa class and a nonerisa class after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by the american medical association a third amended complaint was filed on october 25 2002 the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint on may 21 2003 we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the american medical association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff on may 26 2004 we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based in part due to lack of standing on july 16 2004 plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint seeking to assert rico violations 

  

although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain we do not believe the results of any such actions currently threatened or pending including those described above will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

  

market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices the company’s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and longterm debt 

  

approximately 120 billion of our cash equivalents and investments at december 31 2004 were debt securities assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixedincome investment portfolio at december 31 2004 the fair value of our fixedincome investments would decrease or increase by approximately 355 million we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 

  

to mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our longterm debt with those of our cash equivalents and shortterm 

  

investments including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements approximately 32 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and 825 million had fixed rates as of december 31 2004 a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt 

  

at december 31 2004 we had 207 million of equity investments primarily held by our unitedhealth capital business in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio 

  

concentrations of credit risk 

  

investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject unitedhealth group to concentrations of credit risk our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base as of december 31 2004 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk 

  

cautionary statements 

  

the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the securities and exchange commission in our news releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words or phrases “believes” “anticipates” “expects” “plans” “seeks” “intends” “will likely result” “estimates” “projects” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements 

  

the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider this discussion is intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws we do not undertake to address or update forwardlooking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results consequently no forwardlooking statement can be guaranteed actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications 

  

we must effectively manage our health care costs 

  

under our riskbased product arrangements we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased products excluding aarp have typically comprised approximately 75 to 80 of our total consolidated revenues we generally use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our customers the profitability of our riskbased products depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict price for and effectively manage health care costs total health care costs are affected by the number of 

  

individual services rendered and the cost of each service our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before contract commencement services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the contract commences although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period inflation regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results if medical costs increased by 1 percent without a proportional change in related revenues for unitedhealthcare’s commercial insured products our annual net earnings for 2004 would have been reduced by approximately 105 million in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which we have not received the underlying claims or for which we have received the claims but not yet processed them if these estimates prove too high or too low the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results that change can be either positive or negative to our results 

  

we face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors 

  

our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate for our uniprise and health care services segments competitors include aetna inc cigna corporation coventry health care inc humana inc pacificare health systems inc wellchoice inc and wellpoint inc numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas our specialized care services and ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses the addition of new competitors for at least the shortterm can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors in particular markets competitors may have capabilities that give them a competitive advantage greater market share established reputation superior supplier arrangements existing business relationships and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers or to maintain or advance profitability 

  

our relationship with aarp is important 

  

under our 10year contract with aarp which commenced in 1998 we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members as of december 31 2004 our portion of aarp’s insurance program represented approximately 45 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 38 million aarp members the aarp contract may be terminated early by us or aarp under certain circumstances including a material breach by either party insolvency of either party a material adverse change in the financial condition of either party and by mutual agreement the success of our aarp arrangement depends in part on our ability to service aarp and its members develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 

  

the favorable and unfavorable effects of changes in medicare are uncertain 

  

the medicare changes being implemented as a result of the medicare modernization act of 2003 are complex and wideranging there are numerous changes that will influence our business we have invested considerable resources analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with the changes that may arise in january 2005 the centers for medicare and medicaid services released detailed regulations on major aspects of 

  

the legislation however some important requirements related to the implementation of the new product offerings including the part d prescription drug benefit and the regional medicare advantage preferred provider organizations have not yet been released by the federal government thus creating challenges for planning and implementation we believe the increased funding provided in the legislation will increase the number of competitors in the seniors health services market 

  

our business is subject to government scrutiny and we must respond quickly and appropriately to changes in government regulations 

  

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products to increase prices for certain regulated products and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions delays in obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 

  

we participate in federal state and local government health care coverage programs these programs generally are subject to frequent change including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may do so in the future 

  

state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business including contracting with physicians hospitals and other health care professionals physician reimbursement methods and payment rates coverage determinations claim payments and processing drug utilization and patient safety efforts use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information medical malpractice litigation and governmentsponsored programs we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation or if enacted what their terms will be but their enactment could increase our costs expose us to expanded liability require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 

  

we typically have and are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general the office of the inspector general the office of personnel management the office of civil rights the department of justice and us attorneys such government actions can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 

  

important relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers 

  

we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for competitive prices our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws in any particular market these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 

  

the nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some of the costs associated with litigation 

  

periodically we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims shareholder suits and intellectual propertyrelated litigation in addition because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design management and offerings of our services these matters include but are not limited to claims related to health care benefits coverage medical malpractice actions contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices in 1999 a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business the suits are purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes including the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act “rico” in march 2000 the american medical association filed a lawsuit against us in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for nonnetwork providers although the expenses which we have incurred to date in defending the 1999 class action lawsuits and the american medical association lawsuit have not been material to our business we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of these lawsuits and other matters even if they are without merit 

  

following the events of september 11 2001 the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our selfinsurance however certain types of damages such as punitive damages are not covered by insurance we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 

  

our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems 

  

our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our acquisition activities we have acquired additional systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory problems have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 

  

we use or employ independent third parties such as international business machines corporation ibm with whom we have entered into agreements for significant portions of our data center operations even though we have appropriate provisions in our agreements including provisions with respect to specific performance standards covenants warranties audit rights indemnification and other provisions our dependence on these third parties makes our operations vulnerable to their failure to perform adequately under the contracts due to internal or external factors although there are a limited number of service organizations with the size scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms a change in service providers however could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms 

  

we have intangible assets whose values may become impaired 

  

due largely to our recent acquisitions goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately 107 billion as of december 31 2004 

  

representing approximately 38 of our total assets if we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could in turn negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 

  

we must comply with emerging restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information when providing services to us 

  

the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and hipaa hipaa also imposes guidelines on our business associates as this term is defined in the hipaa regulations even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates we still have limited control over their actions and practices compliance with these proposals requirements and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 

  

our knowledge and informationrelated businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products 

  

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services 

  

the effects of the war on terror and future terrorist attacks could impact the health care industry 

  

the terrorist attacks launched on september 11 2001 the war on terrorism the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the us economy in general and our industry specifically depending on the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies future acts of terrorism and bioterrorism could lead to among other things increased use of health care services including without limitation hospital and physician services loss of membership in health benefit programs we administer as a result of layoffs or other reductions of employment adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees disruption of our information and payment systems increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk such as acts of terrorism and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general

expansion and divestiture of operations   we continually evaluate expansion opportunities in all our businesses and in the normal course of business often consider whether to sell certain businesses or stop offering certain products or services expansion opportunities may include acquiring businesses that are complementary to our existing operations we also devote significant attention to internally developing new products and services for the health and wellbeing sector as we have broadly defined it during 2003 we completed several acquisitions and ceased offering some products in certain markets all as part of our ongoing emphasis on our strategic focus 

government regulation   most of our health and wellbeing services are regulated this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically these revisions could affect our consolidated operations and financial results enactment of federal and state health benefit laws and regulations can also affect our businesses federal regulation   our health care services segment which includes unitedhealthcare ovations and americhoice ovations has medicare advantage contracts that are regulated by cms cms has the right to audit our performance in order to determine compliance with cms’ contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to members our health care services segment also has medicaid and state children’s health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services and other aspects of these programs there is a significant level of regulation surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance in addition because a portion of ingenix’ business includes clinical research it is subject to regulation by the fda we believe we are in compliance with the applicable regulations we believe we are in compliance with these regulations state regulation   all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and health maintenance products regulate those products and operations these states require periodic financial reports from us and impose minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements many of our health plans and each of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates in addition some of our subsidiaries or products may be subject to ppo managed care organization “mco” or tparelated regulations and licensure requirements these regulations differ greatly from state to state but generally contain network contracting product and rate financial and reporting requirements many states also have enacted laws andor adopted regulations governing utilization review and external appeals activities and these laws may apply to some of our operations additionally there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for 6 delivery of services prompt payment of claims confidentiality of consumer health information and covered benefits and services 

hipaa   the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended “hipaa” apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets including selffunded employee benefit plans federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa are now effective these regulations include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations new standards for national provider and employer identifiers are currently being developed by regulators we intend to be in compliance by the enforcement dates however where the law is farreaching and complex or the government delays in providing guidance on some aspects of the law the timeliness of our compliance efforts may be affected additionally different approaches to hipaa’s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines erisa   the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employersponsored health benefit plans erisa is a complex set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor as well as the federal courts erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans particularly those that maintain selffunded plans during 2003 we processed and administered the payment of approximately 25 billion of medical claims on behalf of customers that selfinsure the medical costs of their employees and their employees’ dependents erisa claim regulations which became effective july 2002 require ongoing modifications to our operations we believe that we are in compliance with the regulations fraud and abuse   the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid are complex and changing we continue to emphasize our regulatory compliance efforts for these programs but ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical nature of the regulations mean that compliance efforts in this arena will continue to require significant resources additionally states have begun to focus their antifraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations some states now require filing and approval of antifraud plans and may monitor compliance as part of any market conduct examination we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations and contractual requirements audits and investigations   we are regularly subject to governmental audits investigations and enforcement actions any such government actions can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs in addition a state department of insurance or other state or federal authority including cms the office of the inspector general and state attorneys general may from time to time begin a special audit of one of our health plans our insurance plans or one of our other operations to investigate issues such as utilization management financial eligibility or other data reporting prompt claims payment or coverage determinations for medical services including emergency room care we are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance departments and state attorneys general the office of personnel management the office of the inspector general the office of civil rights and us attorneys we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations audits or reviews 7 individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

international regulation   our ingenix uniprise and health care services segments have limited international operations these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions including various tax tariff and trade regulations as well as employment intellectual property and investment rules and laws 

marketing   our marketing strategy is defined and coordinated by each business’ dedicated marketing staff within these businesses primary marketing responsibility generally resides with a marketing leader and a direct sales force in addition several of the segments also rely upon independent insurance agents and brokers to sell some of their products marketing efforts also include public relations efforts and advertising programs that may use television radio newspapers magazines billboards direct mail and telemarketing 

competition   as a diversified health and wellbeing services company we operate in highly competitive markets our competitors include managed health care companies insurance companies third party administrators and business services outsourcing companies health care providers that have formed networks to directly contract with employers specialty benefit providers government entities and various information and consulting companies for our uniprise and health care services businesses competitors include aetna anthem cigna coventry humana pacificare oxford wellpoint numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas our specialized care services and ingenix business segments also compete with a number of businesses new entrants into the markets in which we compete as well as consolidation within these markets also contribute to a competitive environment we believe the principal competitive factors affecting us and the sales and pricing of our products and services include product innovation consumer satisfaction the level and quality of products and services network capabilities price market share product distribution systems efficient administration operations financial strength and marketplace reputation   we believe that our competitive strengths are enhanced by our customer focus resulting from our operational alignment each unitedhealth group business represents a strategic platform from which we can penetrate more deeply into specific markets using our three core competencies network management knowledge and information and service infrastructure other strengths include the breadth and quality of our products our geographic scope and diversity the scope and depth of our data and information about health care costs and consumption our effective use of proprietary tools and products to coordinate and facilitate programs designed to realize appropriately lower health care costs our disciplined underwriting and pricing practices and staff our significant market position in certain geographic areas the strength of our distribution network our financial strength our generally large provider networks that provide more consumer choice and minimize barriers to access our pointofservice products and our strong marketplace reputation however in some markets we may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons including competitors with more resources longer operating histories larger market shares broader networks narrower networks which may allow greater cost control and lower prices or more established names and reputations

inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results consequently no forwardlooking statement can be guaranteed actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications we must effectively manage our health care costs   under riskbased product arrangements we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums premium revenues from riskbased products excluding aarp comprise approximately 75 of our total consolidated revenues we use approximately 80 to 85 of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our customers the profitability of our riskbased products depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict price for and effectively manage health care costs total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12month period and is generally priced one to four months before contract commencement services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the contract commences although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period inflation regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results for example if medical costs increased by one percent for unitedhealthcare’s commercial insured products our annual net earnings for 2003 would have been reduced by approximately 75 million in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which the underlying claims have not been received by us or for which the claims have been received but not processed if these estimates prove too high or too low the effect of the change will be included in future results 10 we face intense competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors   our businesses compete throughout the united states and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate for our uniprise and health care services businesses competitors include aetna anthem cigna coventry humana pacificare oxford wellpoint numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas our specialized care services and ingenix businesses also compete with a number of businesses moreover we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors in particular markets these competitors may have capabilities that give them a competitive advantage greater market share established reputation superior supplier arrangements existing business relationships and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries this level of consolidation makes it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers and to maintain or advance profitability our relationship with aarp is significant to our ovations business   under our 10year contract with aarp which we entered into in 1998 we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members as of december 31 2003 our portion of aarp’s insurance program represented approximately 41 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 38 million aarp members the aarp contract may be terminated early by us or aarp under certain circumstances including a material breach by either party insolvency of either party a material adverse change in the financial condition of either party and by mutual agreement the success of our aarp arrangement depends in part on our ability to service aarp and its members develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes additionally events that adversely affect aarp or one of its other business partners for its member insurance program could have an adverse effect on the success of our arrangement with aarp for example if customers were dissatisfied with the products aarp offered or its reputation if federal legislation limited opportunities in the medicare market or if the services provided by aarp’s other business partners were unacceptable our business could be adversely affected the effects of the new medicare reform legislation on our business are uncertain   recently enacted medicare reform legislation is complex and wideranging there are numerous provisions in the legislation that will influence our business although at this early stage it is difficult to predict the extent to which our business will be affected while uncertain as to impact we believe the increased funding provided in the legislation will intensify competition in the seniors health services market our business is subject to intense government scrutiny and we must respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in government regulations   our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products to increase prices for certain regulated products and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions delays in obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 11   we participate in federal state and local government health care coverage programs these programs generally are subject to frequent change including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may do so in the future   state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business including contracting with physicians hospitals and other health care professionals physician reimbursement methods and payment rates coverage determinations claim payments and processing use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information and governmentsponsored programs we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation or if enacted what their terms will be but their enactment could increase our costs expose us to expanded liability require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for a loss of business   we are also subject to various governmental investigations audits and reviews such oversight could result in our loss of licensure or our right to participate in certain programs or the imposition of civil or criminal fines penalties and other sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services we are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by the centers for medicare and medicaid services state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general the office of personnel management the office of the inspector general and us attorney general we depend on our relationships with physicians hospitals and other health care providers   we contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit service providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for favorable prices a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws in any particular market these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part the nature of our business exposes us to significant litigation risks and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some of the costs associated with litigation   periodically we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims shareholder suits and intellectual propertyrelated litigation in addition because of the nature of our business we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design management and offerings of our services these matters include but are not limited to claims related to health care benefits coverage medical malpractice actions contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices in 1999 a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business the suits are purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes including erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act “rico” although the expenses which we have incurred to date in defending the 1999 class action lawsuits have not been material to our business we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of the 1999 class action litigation and other matters even if they are without merit 12   following the events of september 11 2001 the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our selfinsurance however certain types of damages such as punitive damages are not covered by insurance we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded our businesses depend significantly on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems   our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our acquisition activities we have acquired additional systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory problems have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences   we depend on independent third parties such as ibm and medco health solutions inc with whom we have entered into agreements for significant portions of our data center operations and pharmacy benefits management and processing respectively even though we have appropriate provisions in our agreement with ibm and medco including provisions with respect to specific performance standards covenants warranties audit rights indemnification and other provisions our dependence on these third parties makes our operations vulnerable to their failure to perform adequately under the contracts due to internal or external factors although there are a limited number of service organizations with the size scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services especially with regard to pharmacy benefits processing and management we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms a change in service providers however could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms we must comply with emerging restrictions on patient privacy including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information when providing services to us   the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at international federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and hipaa hipaa also imposes guidelines on our business associates as this term is defined in the hipaa regulations even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates we still have limited control over their actions and practices compliance with these proposals and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases our knowledge and informationrelated businesses depend significantly on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products   we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions 13 may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services 

the effects of the war on terror and future terrorist attacks could have a severe impact on the health care industry   the terrorist attacks launched on september 11 2001 the war on terrorism the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the us economy in general and our industry specifically depending on the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies future acts of terrorism and bioterrorism could lead to among other things increased use of health care services including without limitation hospital and physician services loss of membership in health plans we administer as a result of layoffs or other reductions of employment adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees disruption of our information and payment systems increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk such as acts of terrorism and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general the market price of our common stock may be particularly sensitive due to the nature of the business in which we operate   the market prices of the securities of the publiclyheld companies in the industry in which we operate have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many external factors including general market trends public communications regarding managed care litigation and judicial decisions legislative or regulatory actions health care cost trends pricing trends competition earnings membership reports of particular industry participants and acquisition activity despite our specific outlook or prospects the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of any of these external factors by way of illustration our stock price has ranged from 3533 on december 31 2001 to 5818 on december 31 2003 as adjusted to reflect stock splits and dividends

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   in re managed care litigation mdl no 1334 beginning in 1999 a series of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business a multidistrict litigation panel has consolidated several litigation cases involving unitedhealth group and our affiliates in the southern district court of florida miami division in december 2000 the unitedhealth group litigation was consolidated with litigation involving other industry members generally the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of erisa and rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered the consolidated suits seek injunctive compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution costs fees and interest payments discovery commenced on september 30 2002 in november 2002 the eleventh circuit granted the industry defendants’ petition to review the class certification order that appeal is pending on april 7 2003 the united states supreme court determined that the rico claims against pacificare and 14 unitedhealthcare should be arbitrated on september 15 2003 the district court granted in part and denied in part the industry defendants’ further motion to compel arbitration significantly the court denied the industry defendants’ motion with respect to plaintiffs’ derivative rico claims on september 19 2003 the industry defendants appealed the district court’s arbitration order to the eleventh circuit a trial date has been set for september 13 2004 

  the american medical association et al v metropolitan life insurance company united healthcare services inc and unitedhealth group this lawsuit was filed on march 15 2000 in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york on april 13 2000 we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york the suit alleges causes of action based on erisa as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing deceptive acts and practices and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for nonnetwork providers the suit seeks declaratory injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs fees and interest payments an amended complaint was filed on august 25 2000 which alleged two classes of plaintiffs an erisa class and a nonerisa class after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by the american medical association a third amended complaint was filed on october 25 2002 the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint we are engaged in discovery in this matter   because of the nature of our business we are routinely subject to lawsuits alleging various causes of action some of these suits may include claims for substantial noneconomic treble or punitive damages we record liabilities for our estimate of probable costs resulting from these matters although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain we do not believe the results of any such actions including those described above or any other types of actions currently threatened or pending individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

expansion and divestiture of operations   we continually evaluate expansion opportunities and in the normal course of business often consider whether to sell certain businesses or stop offering certain products or services expansion opportunities may include acquiring businesses that are complementary to our existing operations during 2002 we completed several acquisitions and ceased offering some products in certain markets all as part of our ongoing emphasis on our strategic focus further we devote significant attention to internally developing new products and services for the health and wellbeing sector as we have broadly defined it 

government regulation   most of our health and wellbeing services are regulated this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 5 these revisions could affect our consolidated operations and financial results enactment of federal and state health benefit laws and regulations can also affect our businesses 

federal regulation   our health care services segment which includes unitedhealthcare ovations and americhoice has medicarechoice contracts that are regulated by cms cms has the right to audit our performance in order to determine compliance with cms’ contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to members our health care services segment also has medicaid and state children’s health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulation regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services and other aspects of these programs we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable regulations however the significant level of regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid makes compliance in this product line a continuing challenge state regulation   all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and health maintenance products regulate those products and operations most states require periodic financial reports from us and impose minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements many of our health plans and each of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates in addition some of our subsidiaries or products may be subject to ppo managed care organization “mco” or tparelated regulations and licensure requirements these regulations differ greatly from state to state but generally contain network contracting financial and reporting requirements many states also have enacted laws andor adopted regulations governing utilization review and external appeals activities and these laws may apply to some of our operations additionally there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services prompt payment of claims confidentiality of consumer health information and covered benefits and services to date these various laws and regulations have not materially affected our consolidated financial position or results of operations hipaa   the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended “hipaa” apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets including selffunded employee benefit plans federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa are now effective with compliance required by april 2003 these regulations include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information we are currently in compliance with these regulations new standards for national provider and employer identifiers are currently being developed by regulators we intend to be in compliance by the enforcement dates however the law is farreaching and complex and the government’s delay in providing guidance on some aspects of the law may affect the timeliness of our compliance efforts additionally different approaches to hipaa’s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines erisa   the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employersponsored health benefit plans erisa is a complex set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor as well as the federal courts erisa places controls on how our business 6 units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans particularly those that maintain selffunded plans during 2002 we processed and administered the payment of approximately 21 billion of medical claims on behalf of customers that selfinsure the medical costs of their employees and their employees’ dependents new erisa claim regulations which became effective july 2002 require ongoing modifications to our operations we believe that we are in compliance with the new regulations 

fraud and abuse   the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid are complex and changing we continue to emphasize our regulatory compliance efforts for these programs but ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical nature of the regulations mean that compliance efforts in this arena will continue to require significant resources additionally states have begun to focus their antifraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations some states now require filing and approval of antifraud plans and may monitor compliance as part of any market conduct examination audits and investigations   we are regularly subject to governmental audits investigations and enforcement actions any such government actions can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs in addition a state department of insurance or other state or federal authority including cms the office of the inspector general and state attorneys general may from time to time begin a special audit of one of our health plans our insurance plans and products or one of our other operations to investigate issues such as utilization management financial eligibility or other data reporting prompt claims payment or coverage of medically necessary care including emergency room care we are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance departments and state attorneys general the office of personnel management the office of the inspector general and us attorneys we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations audits or reviews individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations international regulation   our ingenix and health care services segments both have limited international operations these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions including various tax tariff and trade regulations as well as employment intellectual property and investment rules and laws 

marketing   our marketing strategy is defined and coordinated by each business’s dedicated marketing staff within these businesses primary marketing responsibility generally resides with a marketing leader and a direct sales force in addition several of the segments also rely upon independent insurance agents and brokers to sell some of their products marketing efforts also include public relations efforts and advertising programs that may use television radio newspapers magazines billboards direct mail and telemarketing 

competition   as a diversified health and wellbeing services company we operate in highly competitive markets our competitors include managed health care companies insurance companies tpas and business services outsourcing companies health care providers that have formed networks to directly contract with employers specialty benefit providers government entities and various information and consulting 7 companies new entrants into the markets in which we compete as well as consolidation within these markets also contribute to this competitive environment we believe the principal competitive factors affecting us and the sales and pricing of our products and services include product innovation consumer satisfaction the level and quality of products and services network capabilities price market share product distribution systems efficient administration operations financial strength and marketplace reputation 

  we believe that our competitive strengths are enhanced by our customer focus resulting from our operational alignment each unitedhealth group business represents a strategic platform from which we can penetrate more deeply into specific markets using our three core competencies network management knowledge and information and service infrastructure other strengths include the breadth and quality of our products our geographic scope and diversity the scope and depth of our data and information about health care costs and consumption our effective use of proprietary tools and products to coordinate and facilitate programs designed to realize appropriately lower health care costs our disciplined underwriting and pricing practices and staff our significant market position in certain geographic areas the strength of our distribution network our financial strength our generally large provider networks that provide more consumer choice and minimize barriers to access our pointofservice products and our strong marketplace reputation however in some markets we may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons including competitors with more resources longer operating histories larger market shares broader networks narrower networks which may allow greater cost control and lower prices or more established names and reputations these competitive factors could adversely affect our business and operating results 

employees   as of december 31 2002 we employed approximately 32000 individuals we believe our employee relations are good 

cautionary statements   the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k and in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of our annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this form 10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by us with the securities and exchange commission in our press releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words or phrases “believes” “anticipates” “intends” “will likely result” “estimates” “projects” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements   the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider this discussion is intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws in making these cautionary statements we do not undertake to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected our past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this form 10k in the 2002 annual report to shareholders and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results consequently no forwardlooking statement can be guaranteed actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications 8 health care costs   we use a large portion of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our customers accordingly the profitability of our riskbased products depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict price for and effectively manage health care costs total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12month period and is generally priced three months before contract commencement services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the contract commences although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period inflation regulations and other factors may cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results because of the relatively narrow operating margins of our riskbased arrangements in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which the underlying claims have not been received by us or for which the claims have been received but not processed if these estimates prove too high or too low our earnings may be adjusted later based on actual costs industry factors   the health and wellbeing industries receive significant negative publicity and have been the subject of large jury verdicts this publicity has been accompanied by litigation legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products and services and may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate further increasing our costs of doing business and adversely affecting our profitability competition   in many of our geographic or product markets we compete with a number of other entities some of which may have certain characteristics or capabilities that give them a competitive advantage we believe the barriers to entry in certain markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and consumers enjoy significant flexibility in moving to competitors some of our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services we provide which would decrease our revenues some of our contracted physicians and other health care providers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industry in which we operate as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems industries to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market our ability to retain or increase customers or contracted physicians and other health care providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility control over medical cost trends and marketing expenses may be adversely affected aarp contract   under our longterm contract with aarp we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members as of december 31 2002 our portion of aarp’s insurance program represented approximately 37 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 36 million aarp members the success of our aarp arrangement depends in part on our ability to service these customers develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes additionally events 9 that adversely affect aarp or one of its other business partners for its member insurance program could have an adverse effect on the success of our arrangement with aarp 

government programs   in response to medical cost increases that exceeded medicare program reimbursement rate growth we have withdrawn our medicarechoice product offerings from a number of counties and filed significant benefit adjustments in other counties these and other actions have reduced medicarechoice enrollment and may result in further or complete withdrawal of medicarechoice product offerings when and as permitted by our contracts with the cms under current regulations we are precluded from reentering the counties from which we have withdrawn our medicarechoice product offerings until two years after the effective date of withdrawal   the financial results of our medicarechoice medicaid and state children’s health insurance program schip operations depend on a number of factors including program reimbursement increases government regulations benefit design physician and other health care provider contracting state budgetary pressures medicaid and schip and other factors there can be no assurance that any or all of our government program operations will be profitable in future periods government regulation   our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products to increase prices for certain regulated products and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions delays in obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs   we participate in federal state and local government health care coverage programs these programs generally are subject to frequent change including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may do so in the future   state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues bills and regulations at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business including contracting with physicians hospitals and other health care professionals physician reimbursement methods and payment rates coverage determinations claim payments and processing use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information medical malpractice litigation reform and governmentsponsored programs we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation or if enacted what their terms will be but their enactment could increase our costs expose us to expanded liability require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for a loss of business to new health care funding arrangements   we are also subject to various governmental investigations audits and reviews such oversight could result in our loss of licensure or our right to participate in certain programs or the imposition of civil or criminal fines penalties and other sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services we are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by the cms state and health insurance departments and state attorneys general the office of personnel management the office of the inspector general and us attorneys although the results of pending matters are always uncertain we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations audits or reviews individually 10 or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries these companies are subject to state regulations that among other things may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and may restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by our regulated subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the subsidiary’s level of statutory net income statutory capital and surplus we use cash generated from operations commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility the agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider statutory capital levels when establishing our debt ratings we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require physician hospital and other health care provider relations   one of the significant techniques we use to contain health care costs and facilitate care delivery is to contract with physicians hospitals pharmaceutical benefit managers and pharmaceutical manufacturers and other health care providers for favorable prices a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws in any particular market these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain health care providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part litigation and insurance   sometimes we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims shareholder suits and intellectual propertyrelated litigation in addition because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design management and offerings of our services these matters include but are not limited to claims related to health care benefits coverage medical malpractice actions contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices in 1999 a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business the suits are purported class actions on behalf of certain customers and physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes including erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act “rico” we will incur expenses in the defense of these matters even if they are without merit   recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims in some cases substantial noneconomic treble or punitive damages may be sought we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition certain types of damages such as punitive damages may not be covered by insurance the cost of general business insurance coverage has increased significantly following the events of september 11 2001 as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to routine matters incidental to our business we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from selfinsured matters although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate there can be no assurance that the level of actual losses will not exceed the liabilities recorded 11 data integrity and information systems   our businesses depend significantly on effective information systems and the integrity of the data we use to run these businesses our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our acquisition activities we have acquired additional systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory problems have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences for example the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa and the department of labor’s erisa claim processing regulations require changes to our current systems   we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors although there are a limited number of service organizations with the size scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services especially with regard to pharmacy benefits processing and management we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms a change in service providers however could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results proprietary information and privacy regulations   the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at international federal state and local levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and hipaa hipaa also imposes guidelines on our business associates as this term is defined in the hipaa regulations even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates we still have limited control over their actions and practices compliance with these proposals and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases   the success of our knowledge and informationrelated businesses also depends significantly on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation could have an adverse effect on the ability of our businesses to market and sell products and services and on our consolidated results of operations 12 administration and management   efficient and costeffective administration of our operations is essential to our profitability and competitive positioning staffrelated and other operating expenses may increase from time to time due to business or product startups or expansions growth or changes in business or the mix of products purchased by customers acquisitions regulatory requirements or other reasons unanticipated expense increases may adversely affect our financial results we believe we currently have an experienced capable management and technical staff the market for management and technical personnel including information systems professionals in the health care industry is very competitive loss of key employees or a number of managers or technical staff could adversely affect our ability to administer and manage our business marketing   we market our products and services through both employed sales people and independent sales agents the departure of key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals could impair our ability to retain existing customers some of our customers or potential customers consider our debt ratings accreditation or certification by various private or governmental bodies or rating agencies necessary or important some of our health plans or other business units may not have obtained or maintained or may not desire or be able to obtain or maintain such ratings accreditation or certification which could adversely affect our ability to obtain or acquire or retain business from these customers and potential customers acquisitions and dispositions   we have an active ongoing acquisition and disposition program under which we may engage in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of assets products or businesses some or all of which may be material these transactions may entail risks and uncertainties and may affect ongoing business operations because of unknown liabilities unforeseen administrative needs or the use of resources to integrate the acquired operations failure to identify liabilities anticipate additional administrative needs or effectively integrate acquired operations could result in reduced revenues increased administrative and other costs and customer dissatisfaction terrorist attacks   the terrorist attacks launched on september 11 2001 the war on terrorism the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the us economy in general and our industry specifically depending on the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies future acts of terrorism and bioterrorism could adversely affect us through among other things increased use of health care services including without limitation hospital and physician services loss of membership in health plans we administer as a result of layoffs or other reductions of employment adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees disruption of our information and payment systems increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk such as acts of terrorism and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general financial outlook   from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our future results including estimated revenues earnings per share and other operating and financial metrics any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot assure that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be 13 material and adverse you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information affecting us and our services when evaluating our prospective consolidated results of operations 

general economic conditions   changes in economic conditions could affect our business and results of operations the state of the economy affects our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase prices in some of our businesses although we are continuously striving to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of consumers there can be no assurance that the effects of the current or a future downturn in economic conditions will not cause our existing customers to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will not result in significant loss of customers or decreased margins on our continuing customers stock market   the market prices of the securities of the publiclyheld companies in the industry in which we operate have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors including general market trends public communications regarding managed care litigation and judicial decisions legislative or regulatory actions health care cost trends pricing trends competition earnings membership reports of particular industry participants and acquisition activity we cannot assure the level or stability of the price of our securities at any time or the effect of the foregoing or any other factors on such prices

expansion and divestiture of operations 

  we continually evaluate expansion opportunities and in the normal course of business often consider whether to sell certain businesses or stop offering certain products or services expansion opportunities may include acquiring businesses that are complementary to our existing operations during 2001 we completed several acquisitions and ceased offering some products in certain markets all as part of our ongoing emphasis on our strategic focus further we devote significant attention to internally developing new products and services in the health and wellbeing sector as we have broadly defined it   if we were to make any particular acquisition it may affect our ability to integrate and manage our overall business effectively integration activities relating to acquisitions may increase costs affect revenue and earnings growth and adversely affect our financial results 

government regulation 

  most of our health and wellbeing services are heavily regulated this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically these revisions could affect our operations and financial results enactment of federal and state health benefit laws and regulations can also affect our businesses examples of such laws and regulations include health plan liability laws physician and provider prompt pay laws data privacy mandated benefits limits on contractual terms with physicians and other health care providers including audit payment and termination provisions implementation of a mandatory third party review process for coverage denials and other laws and limits on utilization management and restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk such as acts of terrorism further as our businesses continue to implement their ecommerce initiatives uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area will make compliance an important focus 6 federal programs   our health care services segment which includes unitedhealthcare and ovations has medicarechoice contracts that are regulated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” cms has the right to audit such health plans in order to determine each plan’s compliance with cms’ contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to members the significant level of regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid makes compliance in this product line a continuing challenge our health care services segment also has medicaid and state children’s health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulation regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services and other aspects of these programs we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations state regulation   all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate the activities of those products and operations most states require periodic financial reports and impose minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements many of unitedhealthcare’s health plans and each of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with the state department of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in some circumstances prior notice of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates in addition some of our subsidiaries or products may by subject to ppo managed care organization “mco” or third party administrator “tpa” related regulations and licensure requirements these regulations differ greatly from state to state but generally contain network contracting financial and reporting requirements many states also have enacted laws andor adopted regulations governing utilization review and external appeals activities and these laws may apply to some of our operations additionally there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services prompt payment of claims confidentiality of consumer health information and covered benefits and services to date these various laws and regulations have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations hipaa   the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets including selffunded employee benefit plans covered entities must be compliant with standards for electronic transactions and code sets by october 2002 and with standards for privacy of protected health information by april 2003 new standards for health information security and national provider and employer identifiers are currently being developed by regulators we are in the process of updating our business practices to comply with these standards we plan to be in material compliance by the enforcement dates however the law is farreaching and complex and the government’s delay in providing guidance may affect the timeliness of our compliance efforts additionally different approaches to hipaa’s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines erisa   the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employersponsored health benefit plans erisa is a complex set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor “dol” as well as the federal courts erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans particularly those that maintain selffunded plans new erisa claim regulations effective july 2002 require changes 7 to operations and may lead to increased litigation activity we plan to be in material compliance with the new regulations by the enforcement dates 

fraud and abuse   the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid are complex and changing we have reemphasized our regulatory compliance efforts for these programs but ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulations mean that compliance efforts in this arena will continue to require significant resources additionally states have also begun to focus their antifraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations some states now require filing and approval of antifraud plans and may monitor compliance as part of any market conduct examination audits and investigations   we are regularly subject to governmental audits investigations and enforcement actions any such government actions can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs in addition a state department of insurance or other state or federal authority including cms the office of the inspector general and state attorneys general may from time to time begin a special audit of one of our health plans our insurance plans and products or one of our other operations regarding issues such as utilization management financial eligibility or other data reporting prompt claims payment or coverage of medically necessary care including emergency room care we are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by cms state insurance departments and state attorneys general the office of personnel management the office of the inspector general and us attorneys we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations audits or reviews individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations international regulation   our ingenix and unitedhealthcare segments both have limited international operations as of december 31 2001 ingenix had provided services to customers for trials occurring in over 40 countries and unitedhealthcare’s international division operated health companies or offered consulting services in nine markets around the world these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions including various tax tariff and trade regulations as well as employment intellectual property and investment rules and laws 

marketing 

  our marketing strategy is defined and coordinated by each business’ dedicated marketing staff within these segments primary marketing responsibility generally resides with a marketing leader and a direct sales force in addition several of the segments also rely upon independent insurance agents and brokers to sell some of their products marketing efforts also include public relations efforts and advertising programs that may use television radio newspapers magazines billboards direct mail and telemarketing 

competition 

  as a diversified health and wellbeing services company with a scope that extends far beyond the boundaries of traditional managed health care companies we operate in highly competitive markets our competitors include managed health care companies insurance companies health care providers which have formed networks to directly contract with employers and various information and consulting companies new entrants into the markets in which we compete as well as consolidation within these markets also contribute to this competitive environment we believe that the principal competitive factors 8 affecting us and the sales and pricing of our products and services include product innovation consumer satisfaction the level and quality of products and services network capabilities price market share product distribution systems efficient administration operations financial strength and marketplace reputation 

  we believe that our competitive strengths include the customer focus resulting from our operational realignment each unitedhealth group business represents a strategic platform from which we can penetrate more deeply into specific markets these businesses are anchored in a common pursuit of improved health and well being exploiting three core competencies network management knowledge and information and service infrastructure other strengths include the breadth and quality of our products our geographic scope and diversity our effective use of proprietary tools and products to coordinate and facilitate programs designed to realize appropriately lower health care costs our disciplined underwriting and pricing practices and staff our significant market position in certain geographic areas the strength of our distribution network our financial strength our generally large provider networks that provide more consumer choice and minimize barriers to access our pointofservice products and our strong marketplace reputation however in some markets we may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons including competitors with more resources longer operating histories larger market shares broader networks narrower networks which may allow greater cost control and lower prices or more established names and reputations these competitive factors could adversely affect our business and operating results 

employees 

  as of december 31 2001 we employed approximately 30000 individuals the company believes its employee relations are good 

cautionary statements 

  the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k and the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of our annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this document include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” when used in this annual report on form 10k and in future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission in our press releases presentations to securities analysts or investors and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers the words or phrases “believes” “anticipates” “intends” “will likely result” “estimates” “projects” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements any of these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements   the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider this discussion is intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws in making these cautionary statements we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results and are not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications in addition any of the matters discussed below may have affected our past as well as current forwardlooking statements about future results any or all forwardlooking statements in this report in the 2001 annual report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results consequently no forwardlooking statement can be guaranteed actual future results may vary materially from those expressed in our communications 9 health care costs   we use a large portion of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services or supplies delivered to our customers total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service much of our premium revenue is priced before services are delivered and the related costs are incurred usually on a prospective annual basis although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period inflation regulations and other factors may cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred that have not yet been reported to us because of these estimates our earnings may be adjusted later to reflect the actual costs relatively small changes in medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and our ability to properly estimate future health care costs over fixed premium periods can create significant changes in our financial results because of the relatively narrow margins of our insurance products industry factors   the managed care industry receives significant negative publicity and has been the subject of large jury awards this publicity has been accompanied by litigation legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products and services and may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate further increasing our costs of doing business and adversely affecting our profitability competition   in many of our geographic or product markets we compete with a number of other entities some of which may have certain characteristics or capabilities that give them a competitive advantage we believe the barriers to entry in these markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and consumers enjoy significant flexibility in moving to new providers of health and wellbeing services certain of our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services we provide which would decrease our revenues certain of our contracted physicians and other health care providers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industry in which we operate as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems industries to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market our ability to retain or increase customers or contracted physicians and other health care providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility control over medical cost trends and marketing expenses may be adversely affected aarp contract   under our longterm contract with aarp we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members as of december 31 2001 our portion of aarp’s insurance program represented approximately 35 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 35 million aarp members the success of our aarp arrangement depends in part on our ability to service these customers develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes additionally events that adversely affect aarp or one of its other business partners for its member insurance program could have an adverse effect on the success of our arrangement with aarp 10 medicare operations   in response to medical cost increases that exceeded medicare program reimbursement rate growth we have withdrawn our medicarechoice product offerings from a number of counties and filed significant benefit adjustments in other counties these and other actions have reduced medicarechoice enrollment and may result in further withdrawals of medicarechoice product offerings when and as permitted by our contracts with the cms we are precluded from reentering the counties from which we have withdrawn our medicarechoice product offerings until two years after the effective date of withdrawal   we will continue to offer medicarechoice products in economically viable markets and are exploring alternative arrangements to provide health benefits to seniors however the financial results of our medicarechoice operations depend on a number of factors including future medicare program reimbursement increases government regulations benefit design physician and other health care provider contracting and other factors there can be no assurance that our medicarechoice operations will be profitable in future periods government programs and regulation   our business is heavily regulated domestically at the federal state and local levels and internationally the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely affect our revenue or could increase our costs we participate in federal state and local government health care coverage programs these programs generally are subject to frequent change including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may also do so in the future   state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues congress is considering patients’ bill of rights legislation that if adopted could fundamentally alter erisa’s treatment of liability for noncompliance fiduciary breach of contract and improper benefit coverage denials other bills and regulations at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business including physician and other health care provider contracting claim payments and processing confidentiality of health information and governmentsponsored programs while we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation or if enacted what their terms will be their enactment could increase our costs expose us to expanded liability require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for a loss of business to new health care funding arrangements further as our businesses continue to implement their ecommerce initiatives uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area will make it difficult to ensure compliance   we are also subject to various governmental reviews audits and investigations such oversight could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs or the imposition of civil or criminal fines penalties and other sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services we are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by the cms state insurance departments and state attorneys general the office of personnel management the office of the inspector general and us attorneys we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations audits or reviews individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 11   our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include health maintenance organizations and insurance companies these companies are subject to state regulations that among other things may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and may restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by our regulated subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the subsidiary’s level of statutory net income statutory capital and surplus physician hospital and other health care provider relations   one of the significant techniques we use to contain health care costs and facilitate care delivery is contracting with physicians hospitals and other health care providers because our health plans are geographically diverse and most of those health plans contract with a large number of these providers we believe our aggregate exposure to provider relations issues is limited a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these providers from federal and state antitrust laws the adoption of which could affect this assessment in any particular market these providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies litigation and insurance   we may be a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims shareholder suits including securities fraud and intellectual property related litigation in addition because of the nature of our businesses we are routinely party to a variety of legal actions related to the design management and offerings of our services these matters include claims related to health care benefits coverage medical malpractice actions allegations of anticompetitive and unfair business activities disputes over compensation and termination of contracts including those with physicians and other health care providers disputes related to our administrative services including actions alleging claim administration errors and failure to disclose rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements disputes over benefit copayment calculations claims related to disclosure of certain business practices and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance in 1999 a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business the suits are purported class actions on behalf of certain customers and physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes including erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act “rico” while we believe these suits against us are without merit and we intend to defend our position vigorously we will incur expenses in the defense of these matters and we cannot predict their outcome   recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims in some cases substantial noneconomic treble or punitive damages may be sought we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition certain types of damages such as punitive damages may not be covered by insurance and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future information systems   our businesses depend significantly on effective information systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences for example the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa and the department of labor’s erisa claim processing regulations may require 12 changes to current systems in addition we obtain significant portions of our systemsrelated or other services or facilities from independent third parties which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately as a result of our acquisition activities we have acquired additional systems and have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could cause the loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers issues in determining medical cost estimates customer and physician and other health care provider disputes regulatory problems increases in administrative expenses or other adverse consequences 

data and proprietary information   many of our products and services depend significantly on the integrity of the data on which they are based if the information contained in our databases were found or perceived to be inaccurate or if such information were generally perceived to be unreliable commercial acceptance of our databaserelated products would be adversely and materially affected furthermore the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at international federal state and local levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation these restrictions could adversely affect revenues from certain of our products or services and more generally affect our business financial condition and results of operations   there are various recently adopted state laws that address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most enact privacy provisions from the federal grammleachbliley act additionally new federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa are now effective with compliance required by april 2003 compliance with these proposals and new regulations could result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes and may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases the success of our knowledge and informationrelated businesses also depends significantly on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights we cannot assure that these legal protections and precautions will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation could have an adverse effect on the ability of our businesses to market and sell products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations administration and management   efficient and costeffective administration of our operations is essential to our profitability and competitive positioning while we manage expenses staffrelated and other administrative expenses may increase from time to time due to business or product startups or expansions growth or changes in business or the mix of products purchased by customers acquisitions regulatory requirements or other reasons unanticipated expense increases may adversely affect our financial results further we believe we currently have an experienced capable management and technical staff the market for management and technical personnel including information systems professionals in the health care industry is very competitive loss of certain key employees or a number of managers or technical staff could adversely affect our ability to administer and manage our business marketing   we market our products and services through both employed sales people and independent sales agents although we have many sales employees and agents the departure of certain key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals could impair our ability to retain existing customers in addition certain of our customers or potential customers consider our debt ratings accreditation or certification by various private or governmental bodies or rating agencies necessary or important certain of 13 our health plans or other business units may not have obtained or maintained or may not desire or be able to obtain or maintain such ratings accreditation or certification which could adversely affect our ability to obtain or retain business with these customers 

acquisitions and dispositions   we have an active ongoing acquisition and disposition program under which we may engage in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of assets products or businesses some or all of which may be material these transactions may entail certain risks and uncertainties and may affect ongoing business operations because of unknown liabilities unforeseen administrative needs or increased efforts to integrate the acquired operations failure to identify liabilities anticipate additional administrative needs or effectively integrate acquired operations could result in reduced revenues increased administrative and other costs and customer dissatisfaction terrorist attacks   the terrorist attacks launched on september 11 2001 the war on terrorism the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the us economy in general and our industry specifically depending on the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies future acts of terrorism and bioterrorism could adversely affect our company through among other things increased use of health care services including without limitation hospital and physician services ancillary testing and procedures increased prescriptions for certain drugs mental health and other services loss of membership as a result of layoffs or other reductions of employment adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees disruption of our information and payment systems increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk such as acts of terrorism and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general financial outlook   from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our future results including estimated revenues net earnings and other operating and financial metrics any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot assure that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information affecting us and our services when evaluating our prospective results of operations general economic conditions   changes in economic conditions could affect our business and results of operations the state of the economy could affect our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase prices in some of our businesses although we are continuously striving to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of consumers there can be no assurance that the effects of the current or a future downturn in economic conditions will not cause our existing customers to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will not result in significant loss of customers or decreased margins on our continuing customers 14 stock market   the market prices of the securities of the publiclyheld companies in the industry in which we operate have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors including general market trends public communications regarding managed care litigation and judicial decisions legislative or regulatory actions health care cost trends pricing trends competition earnings membership reports of particular industry participants and acquisition activity we cannot assure the level or stability of the price of our securities at any time or the affect of the foregoing or any other factors on such prices

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  in september 1999 a group of plaintiffs’ trial lawyers publicly announced that they were targeting the managed care industry by way of class action litigation since that time we have received several purported class action matters that generally challenge managed care practices including cost containment mechanisms disclosure obligations and payment methodologies we intend to defend vigorously all of these cases   in re managed care litigation mdl no 1334 the multidistrict litigation panel has consolidated several litigation matters involving unitedhealth group and its affiliates in the southern district of florida miami division the unitedhealth group matters have been consolidated with litigation involving other industry members for the coordination of pretrial proceedings the litigation has been divided into two tracks with one track comprising consumer claims and the other health care provider claims generally the claims made in this consolidated litigation allege violations of erisa and rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits the litigation also asserts breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims alleging that unitedhealth group affiliates fail to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered the consolidated suits seek injunctive compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution costs fees and interest payments following the court’s initial decisions on industry members’ motions to dismiss the complaints amended complaints were filed in both tracks on february 20 2002 the court granted in part and denied in part the industry defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the member track litigation in significant part the court limited the rico and erisa claims that could be brought by the plaintiffs and dismissed entirely the common law claims for civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment on march 14 2002 the court certified to the 11th circuit the threshold issue of whether plaintiffs have standing to assert their rico claims the 11th circuit has not ruled as to whether they will review the issue all activity was stayed in the health care provider track pending resolution of a threshold appeal to determine which of the health care provider claims must be arbitrated on march 14 2002 the 11th circuit affirmed the trial court’s arbitration ruling and it is anticipated that the stay will be lifted in both tracks decisions are pending on 16 plaintiffs’ motions for class certification additionally a decision is pending on industry members’ motion to dismiss in the health care provider track

ingenix 

our ingenix business is a leader in the field of health care data and information research analysis and application ingenix serves multiple health care market segments on a businesstobusiness basis including pharmaceutical companies health insurers and other payers care providers large employers and government agencies early in 2000 ingenix was aligned into two primary operating divisions ingenix health information and ingenix pharmaceutical services

expansion and divestiture of operations 

we continually evaluate expansion and divestiture opportunities and in the normal course of business often consider whether to sell certain businesses or stop offering certain products or services expansion opportunities may include acquiring businesses that are complementary to our existing operations during 2000 we completed several acquisitions and also sold or terminated certain lines of business and ceased offering some products all as part of our ongoing emphasis on our strategic focus further we devote significant attention to developing new products and services in the health and wellbeing sector as we have broadly defined it 

if we were to make any particular acquisition it may affect our ability to integrate and manage our overall business effectively integration activities relating to acquisitions may increase costs affect membership affect revenue and earnings growth and adversely affect our financial results 

government regulation 

most of our health and wellbeing services are heavily regulated this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically these revisions could affect our operations and financial results enactment of federal and state managed care laws and regulations can also affect our businesses examples of such laws and regulations include health plan liability laws physician prompt pay laws restrictions on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable medical and claims data mandated benefits limits on contractual terms with providers including audit payment and termination provisions implementation of a mandatory third party review process for coverage denials and other laws and limits on utilization management further as our businesses continue to implement their ecommerce initiatives uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area will make compliance an important focus 

federal programs 

unitedhealthcares health plans that have medicarechoice contracts are regulated by the health care financing administration hcfa hcfa has the right to audit such health plans in order to determine each plans compliance with hcfas contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to members the law enforcement environment with respect to health care issues make compliance in this product line a continuing challenge some of unitedhealthcares health plans also have medicaid and state childrens health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulation regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services and other aspects of these programs further some of unitedhealthcares health plans have contracts to participate in the federal employees health benefits program fehbp these contracts are subject to extensive regulation including complex rules regarding premiums charged fehbp is authorized to audit retroactively the rates charged and seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program depending on the outcome of such audits we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations 

state regulation 

all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate the activities of those products and operations most states require periodic financial reports and impose minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements many of unitedhealthcares health plans and each of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations such regulations generally require registration with the state department of insurance and the filing of certain reports that describe capital structure ownership financial condition certain intercompany transactions and general business operations some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of acquisitions and certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates in addition some of our subsidiaries or products may by subject to ppo managed care organization mco or tpa regulations and licensure requirements these regulations differ greatly from state to state but generally contain network contracting financial and reporting requirements many states also have enacted laws andor adopted regulations governing utilization review activities and these laws may apply to some of our operations generally these laws and regulations set specific standards for delivery of services confidentiality of member health information staffing and policies and procedures of private review entities including the credentials required of personnel to date these various laws and regulations have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations 

hipaa 

the standards of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets including selffunded employee benefit plans hipaas administrative simplification provisions establishing new standards for electronic transactions as well as for the privacy and the security of protected health information and standardizing national provider and employer identifiers are in the process of regulatory completion it is uncertain when these new rules will become effective hipaas coveragerelated provisions have been implemented through regulation and include guarantees of the availability and renewability of health insurance for certain employees and individuals limits on termination options and on the use of preexisting condition exclusions prohibitions against discriminating on the basis of health status and requirements which make it easier to continue coverage in cases where an employee is terminated or changes employers 

we do not believe that compliance with those aspects of hipaa currently in effect and those in the process of regulatory completion if adopted as currently proposed will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations the law is farreaching and complex however and proper interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve consequently our efforts to measure monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with hipaa are ongoing significant enforcement responsibilities for hipaas provisions have been given to the states and it is unclear how hipaas administrative simplification rules particularly those regarding data privacy will interact with existing or emerging state law different approaches to hipaas provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 

erisa 

the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer sponsored health benefit plans erisa is a complex set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor dol as well as the federal courts erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans particularly those that maintain selffunded plans for example the dol has issued a complex set of claim regulations which will require changes to operations and may lead to increased litigation activity 

fraud and abuse 

investigating and prosecuting health care fraud and abuse is a top priority for the nations law enforcement entities the funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare medicaid and the fehbp we participate in these programs the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these programs are complex and changing we have reemphasized our regulatory compliance efforts for these programs but ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources 

audits and investigations 

we are regularly subject to governmental audits investigations and enforcement actions any such government actions can result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs in addition a state department of insurance or other state or federal authority including hcfa and the office of the inspector general may from time to time begin a special audit of one of our health plans our insurance 

plans and products or one of our other operations regarding issues such as utilization management financial eligibility or other data reporting prompt claims payment or coverage of medically necessary care including emergency room care we are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by hcfa state insurance departments and state attorneys general the office of personnel management the office of the inspector general and us attorneys we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations audits or reviews individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

international regulation 

our ingenix and unitedhealthcare segments both have limited international operations as of december 31 2000 ingenix had operations in 22 countries principally related to its pharmaceutical services business and unitedhealthcares international division operated health companies or offered consulting services in eight markets around the world these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions including various tax tariff and trade regulations as well as employment intellectual property and investment rules and laws 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is defined and coordinated by each segments dedicated marketing staff within these segments primary marketing responsibility generally resides with a marketing leader and a direct sales force in addition several of the segments also rely upon independent insurance agents and brokers to sell some of their products marketing efforts also include public relations efforts and advertising programs that may use television radio newspapers magazines billboards direct mail and telemarketing

as a diversified health and wellbeing services company with a scope that extends far beyond the traditional boundaries of managed health care companies we operate in highly competitive markets our competitors include managed health care companies insurance companies employer groups which have elected to selfinsure health care providers which have formed networks to directly contract with employers and various information and consulting companies new entrants into the markets in which we compete as well as consolidation within these markets also contribute to this competitive environment we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting us and our products and services include the offering of innovative products consumer satisfaction the level and quality of products and services network capabilities price market share product distribution systems efficient administration operations financial strength and marketplace reputation 

we currently believe that our competitive strengths include the customer focus resulting from our operational realignment each unitedhealth group business represents a strategic platform from which we can grow vertically within specific markets these businesses are anchored in a common pursuit of improved health and well being exploiting three core competencies network management knowledge and information and service infrastructure other strengths include the breadth and quality of our products our geographic scope and diversity our care coordination program our disciplined underwriting and pricing practices and staff our significant market position in certain geographic areas the strength of our distribution network our financial strength our generally large provider networks that provide more consumer choice our pointofservice products our experience and our generally favorable marketplace reputation however in some markets we may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons including competitors with more resources longer operating histories larger market shares broader networks narrower networks which may allow greater cost control and lower prices or more established names and reputations these competitive factors could adversely affect our business and operating results 

employees 

as of december 31 2000 we employed approximately 30000 individuals the company believes its employee relations are good

health care costs 

we use a large portion of our revenue to pay the costs of health care services or supplies delivered to our members total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service much of our premium revenue is priced before services are delivered and the related costs are incurred usually on a prospective annual basis although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period competition regulations and other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums these factors may include increased use of services increased cost of individual services catastrophes epidemics the introduction of new or costly treatments medical cost inflation new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use in addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of claims incurred that have not yet been received or processed because of these estimates our earnings may be adjusted later to reflect the actual costs relatively insignificant changes in medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues because of the narrow margins of our health plan business can create significant changes in its financial results 

industry factors 

the managed care industry receives significant negative publicity and has been the subject of large jury awards this publicity has been accompanied by increased litigation legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products and services and may increase the regulatory 

burdens under which we operate further increasing our costs of doing business and adversely affecting our profitability 

competition 

in many of our geographic or product markets we compete with a number of other entities some of which may have certain characteristics or capabilities that give them a competitive advantage we believe the barriers to entry in these markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and consumers enjoy significant flexibility in moving to new providers of health and well being services certain of our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services we provide which would decrease our revenues certain of our contracted providers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us in addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industry in which we operate as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems industries to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market our ability to retain or increase customers or providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility control over medical cost trends and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

aarp contract 

under our longterm contract with aarp we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members as of december 31 2000 our portion of aarps insurance program represents approximately 35 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 35 million aarp members the success of the aarp arrangement will depend in part on our ability to service these members develop additional products and services price the products and services competitively and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes additionally events that adversely affect aarp or one of its other business partners for its member insurance program could have an adverse effect on the success of our arrangement with aarp 

medicare operations 

in the second quarter of 1998 we experienced a significant rise in the medical care ratio for our medicare operations the increase in medical costs was primarily due to the business growth in new markets with higher and more volatile medical cost trends coupled with lower reimbursement rates in response we have withdrawn our medicare product offerings from a number of counties and filed significant benefit adjustments these and other actions have reduced medicare enrollment and may result in further withdrawals of medicare product offerings when and as permitted by our contracts with hcfa we are precluded from reentering the counties from which we have withdrawn our medicare product offerings until 5 years after the respective effective date of withdrawal 

we will continue to offer medicare products in strong and economically viable markets however our ability to improve the financial results of our medicare operations will depend on a number of factors including future premium increases growth in markets where we have achieved sufficient size to operate efficiently benefit design provider contracting and other factors there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully prevent future losses on our medicare operations 

government programs and regulation 

our business is heavily regulated at federal state and local levels the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations existing or future laws and rules could force us to change 

how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements and increase our liability for medical malpractice or other actions we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely affect our revenue or could increase our costs we participate in federal state and local government health care coverage programs these programs generally are subject to frequent change including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels or reduce or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may also do so in the future 

state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues congress is considering various forms of patients bill of rights legislation which if adopted could fundamentally alter erisas treatment of liability for noncompliance fiduciary breach of contract and improper coverage denials additionally there recently have been federal and state legislative attempts to limit erisas preemptive effect on state laws if adopted such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations other proposed bills and regulations at state and federal levels may impact certain aspects of our business including provider contracting claims payments and processing confidentiality of health information and governmentfunded programs further tax code changes considered from time to time by congress may make it easier and more cost effective for employers to establish defined contribution plans while we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation or if enacted what their terms will be their enactment could increase our costs expose us to expanded liability require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for a loss of business to new health care funding arrangements further as our businesses continue to implement their ecommerce initiatives uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area will make it difficult to ensure compliance 

we are also subject to various governmental reviews audits and investigations such oversight could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs or the imposition of civil or criminal fines penalties and other sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services we are currently involved in various governmental investigations audits and reviews these include routine regular and special investigations audits and reviews by hcfa state insurance departments and state attorneys general the office of personnel management the office of the inspector general and us attorneys 

our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries which include hmos and insurance companies these companies are subject to state regulations that among other things may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital as defined by each state and may restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies generally the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by our regulated subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entitys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 

provider relations 

one of the significant techniques we use to manage health care costs and facilitate care delivery is contracting with physicians hospitals and other providers because our health plans are geographically diverse and most of those health plans contract with a large number of providers we currently believe our aggregate exposure to provider relations issues is limited a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain providers from federal and state antitrust laws the adoption of which could impact this assessment in any particular market providers could refuse to contract demand higher 

payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets certain providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage continue to expand these providers may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage those activities could adversely affect our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas 

litigation and insurance 

we may be a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business such as employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims shareholder suits including securities fraud and intellectual property related litigation in addition because of the nature of our business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of our products and services these could include claims relating to the denial of health care benefits medical malpractice actions allegations of anticompetition and unfair business activities provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts disputes related to selffunded business including actions alleging claim administration errors and the failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements disputes over copayment calculations claims related to the failure to disclose certain business practices and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance a number of class action lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our competitors in the managed care business the suits are purported class actions on behalf of all of our managed care members and network providers for alleged breaches of federal statutes including erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act rico while we believe these suits against us are without merit and we intend to defend our position vigorously we will incur expenses in the defense of these matters and we cannot predict their outcome 

recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims in some cases substantial noneconomic treble or punitive damages may be sought we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition certain types of damages such as punitive damages may not be covered by insurance and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

information systems 

our businesses depend significantly on effective information systems and we have many different information systems for our various businesses our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences for example hipaas administrative simplification provisions and the dols claim processing regulations may ultimately require significant changes to current systems in addition we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systemsrelated or other services or facilities from independent third parties which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately as a result of our acquisition activities we have acquired additional systems and have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could cause the loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers issues in 

determining medical cost estimates customer and provider disputes regulatory problems increases in administrative expenses or other adverse consequences 

administration and management 

efficient and costeffective administration of our operations is essential to our profitability and competitive positioning while we attempt to effectively manage expenses staffrelated and other administrative expenses may arise from time to time due to business or product startups or expansions growth or changes in business acquisitions regulatory requirements or other reasons these expense increases are not clearly predictable and may adversely affect results further we believe we currently have an experienced capable management and technical staff the market for management and technical personnel including information systems professionals in the health care industry is very competitive loss of certain key employees or a number of managers or technical staff could adversely affect our ability to administer and manage our business 

marketing 

we market our products and services through both employed sales people and independent sales agents although we have many sales employees and agents the departure of certain key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals could impair our ability to retain existing customers and members in addition certain of our customers or potential customers consider rating accreditation or certification of us by various private or governmental bodies or rating agencies necessary or important certain of our health plans or other business units may not have obtained or maintained or may not desire or be able to obtain or maintain such rating accreditation or certification which could adversely affect our ability to obtain or retain business with these customers 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we have an active ongoing acquisition and disposition program under which we may engage in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of assets products or businesses some or all of which may be material these transactions may entail certain risks and uncertainties and may affect ongoing business operations because of unknown liabilities unforeseen administrative needs or increased efforts to integrate the acquired operations failure to identify liabilities anticipate additional administrative needs or effectively integrate acquired operations could result in reduced revenues increased administrative and other costs or customer confusion or dissatisfaction 

data and proprietary information 

many of the products that are part of our knowledge and informationrelated business depend significantly on the integrity of the data on which they are based if the information contained in our databases were found or perceived to be inaccurate or if such information were generally perceived to be unreliable commercial acceptance of our databaserelated products would be adversely and materially affected furthermore the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at federal state and local levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation these restrictions could adversely affect revenues from certain of our products or services and more generally affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

there are various legislative and regulatory proposals currently under consideration that address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data including regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa compliance with these proposals could result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes additionally if enacted some of these proposals may impose restrictions on our use of patient data 

the success of our knowledge and informationrelated business also depends significantly on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our products we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights we cannot assure that these legal protections and precautions will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows such litigation could have an adverse effect on the ability of our knowledge and informationrelated business to market and sell its products and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our future results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risk and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot assure that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential shareholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information affecting us and our services when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

stock market 

the market prices of the securities of the publiclyheld companies in the industry in which we operate have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors including general market trends public communications regarding managed care litigation and judicial decisions legislative or regulatory actions health care cost trends pricing trends competition earnings membership reports of particular industry participants and acquisition activity we cannot assure the level or stability of the price of our securities at any time or the impact of the foregoing or any other factors on such prices
