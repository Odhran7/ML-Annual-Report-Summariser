backlog 

applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order backlog and customer commitments backlog consisted of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 30 2022 and october 31 2021 was as follows 



of the total backlog as of october 30 2022 approximately 32 is not reasonably expected to be filled within the next 12 months 

new export rules and regulations issued in december 2022 are expected to reduce backlog that was not reasonably expected to be filled within 12 months by approximately 989 million 

applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or order cancellations customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

applied’s worldwide manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly integration and test of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries primarily including china israel singapore taiwan the united states and other countries in asia applied uses qualified vendors including contract manufacturers to supply parts services and product support applied’s supply chain strategy commits to adhere to ethical labor practices responsible minerals sourcing responsible business alliance and semi guidelines and the applied materials standards of business conduct as defined in applied’s environmental social and governance esg commitment 

although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a qualified single supplier or a limited group of qualified suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for parts monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers maintaining appropriate inventories of parts qualifying new parts on a timely basis and ensuring quality and performance of parts 

research development and engineering 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering rde must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers and ecosystem partners to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

business and industry risks 

the industries that applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries applied is subject to variable industry conditions since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies enduser demand customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital consumer buying patterns and general economic and political conditions applied’s industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology these changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on applied’s net sales operating expenses gross margins and net income the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on applied’s results of operations 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs during periods of decreasing demand applied’s gross margins cash flows and earnings may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy 

uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets national debt fiscal or monetary concerns rising inflation and interest rates in various regions and economic recession could materially adversely impact applied’s operating results markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand such decreases in spending and demand have in the past caused and may in the future cause our customers to push out cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services which could negatively impact demand for our products and services reduce our backlog increase our inventory and materially adversely impact our operating results 

similarly changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted in and may continue to result in a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products such shortages as well as shipment delays due to transportation capacity and interruptions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements accelerated digital transformation may further increase consumer demand and exacerbate such shortages and also strain our manufacturing capacity which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands and thus have an adverse impact on our revenues results of operations and financial condition 

uncertain or adverse economic and market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital increased costs or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertain economic and industry conditions and continued supply chain disruptions also make it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations if applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings 

applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate due to rising inflation rising interest rates economic recession or impacts of the covid19 pandemic and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts which could affect its ability to manage its operations 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

applied has product development engineering manufacturing sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas moreover in fiscal 2022 approximately 88 of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states as a result of the global nature of its operations applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

• uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands 

• global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations trade policies and sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes including new and changing export regulations for certain exports to china and any retaliatory measures 

• positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial andor security issues posed by the development sale or export of certain products and technologies 

• political instability natural disasters regional or global health epidemics social unrest terrorism acts of war or other geopolitical turmoil or cybersecurity incidents in locations where applied has operations suppliers or sales or that may influence the value chain of the industries that applied serves 

• political and social attitudes laws rules regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over nondomestic companies including customer or governmentsupported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors 

• customer or governmentsupported efforts to influence applied to conduct more or less of its operations and sourcing in a particular country 

• variations among and changes in local regional national or international laws and regulations including contract intellectual property cybersecurity data privacy labor tax and importexport laws and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations 

• ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries 

• interruptions to applied’s or its supplier’s supply chain 

• the availability or increasing costs of raw material commodity energy and shipping or volatility in such costs 

• delays or restrictions on personnel travel and in shipping materials or finished products between and within countries 

• geographically diverse operations and projects and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes procedures and internal controls and comply with environmental health and safety anticorruption and other regulatory requirements 

• failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels languages cultures customs business practices and worker expectations and differing employment practices and labor issues 

• variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers suppliers and governments 

• fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates including the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar against the japanese yen israeli shekel euro taiwanese dollar singapore dollar chinese yuan or korean won 

• the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world 

• performance of thirdparty providers of outsourced functions including certain engineering software development manufacturing information technology and other activities 

• service interruptions from utilities transportation data hosting or telecommunications providers or other events beyond our control 

• impacts of climate change on the operations of applied its customers and suppliers 

• challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries 

• the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions and 

• uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries 

global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations including import and export license requirements trade sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors 

we sell a significant majority of our products into jurisdictions outside of the united states including china taiwan japan and korea we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the united states there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among the united states and the countries in which we conduct our business that political diplomatic and national security factors can lead to global trade issues and changes in trade policies and export regulations in particular with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry the united states and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose new trade restrictions and export regulations and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods trade restrictions and export regulations or increases in tariffs and additional taxes including any retaliatory measures can negatively impact enduser demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or prohibit our ability to sell products provide services or purchase necessary equipment and supplies any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

for example certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses and our inability to obtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and negatively impact our business the us government recently announced new export regulations for us semiconductor technology sold in china including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services which have limited the market for certain of our products adversely impacted our revenues and increased our exposure to foreign competition the us department of commerce has promulgated rules and regulations expanding export license requirements for us companies that sell certain products to entities in china whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to china added certain chinese companies to its “entity list” and “unverified list” making those companies subject to additional licensing requirements and expanded licensing requirements for exports to china of items for use in the development or production of integrated circuits and certain technologies these rules and regulations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products or provide services to certain customers in china obtaining export licenses may be difficult costly and timeconsuming and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in china may cause us to be displaced by foreign businesses and competitors and adversely affect our results of operations the implementation and interpretation of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by the us government is uncertain and evolving and may make it more challenging for applied to manage its operations and forecast its operating results the us and other governmental agencies may in the future promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting the company’s ability to provide certain of its products and services to customers outside the us including china these and other regulatory changes that may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as a global business with customers suppliers and operations in many countries around the world applied may from time to time receive inquiries from government authorities about transactions between applied and certain foreign entities for example in august 2022 applied received a subpoena from the us attorney’s office for the district of massachusetts requesting information relating to certain china customer shipments we are cooperating fully with the government these inquiries are subject to uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry or any other governmental inquires or proceedings that may occur any violation or alleged violation of law or regulations could result in significant legal costs or in legal proceedings in which applied or its employees could be subjected to fines and penalties and could result in restrictions on applied’s business and damage to its reputation and could have an adverse impact on its business operations financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore government authorities may take retaliatory actions impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies require the license or other transfer of intellectual property or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business many of these challenges are present in china and korea markets that represent a significant portion of applied’s business 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated particularly in china taiwan and korea a relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of applied’s business as a result the actions of even a single customer or export regulations that apply to customers in certain countries such as those in china have exposed and can further expose applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility the geographic concentration of applied’s customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer including as a result of changes in government policy have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year and have had and may continue to have a significant impact on applied’s net sales gross margins and net income applied’s products are configured to customer specifications and changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders including as a result of uncertain or adverse economic conditions our inability to fulfill orders due to export regulations shortage of parts transportation capacityinterruptions or any other reason applied may not be able to replace the business which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition the concentration of applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on applied’s results of operations and cash flow to the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints applied may incur bad debt expense which may have a significant impact on its results of operations major customers may also seek pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied which may have a negative impact on applied’s business cash flow revenue and gross margins 

supply chain disruptions manufacturing interruptions or delays or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand lead to higher costs or result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts materials and services including components and subassemblies from suppliers and contract manufacturers significant and sudden increases in demand for applied’s products as well as worldwide demand for electronic products have resulted in and may continue to result in a shortage of parts materials and services needed to manufacture applied’s products such shortages as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts materials or services and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand moreover lockdowns that may from time to time be imposed in various geographic regions in response to periodic spikes in covid19 cases and related travel and logistics restrictions may result in additional supply chain and transportation disruptions production delays capacity limitations and cost increases our operating results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts materials or services needed to manufacture applied’s products or if we are unable to do so on a timely manner or on favorable terms ongoing supply chain constraints may continue to increase costs of logistics and parts for our products and may cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers such increase in costs may lead to reduced demand for our products and materially adversely impact our operating results some key parts are subject to long leadtimes or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing supply chain disruptions have caused and may continue to cause delays in our equipment production and delivery schedules which can lead to our business performance becoming significantly dependent on quarterend production and delivery schedules and could have an adverse impact on our operating and financial results volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can also increase capital technical operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses or scale back or cease operations which could impact our ability to meet customer demand 

applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver or install products or services increased costs customer order cancellations or reduced demand for its products as a result of 

• global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations trade policies and sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes including new and changing export regulations for certain exports to china where a significant portion of applied’s supply chain is located and any retaliatory measures that adversely impact applied or its direct or subtier suppliers 

• the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a costeffective basis 

• volatility in the availability and cost of parts commodities energy and shipping related to our products including increased costs due to rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions 

• difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export licenses and approvals 

• shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints 

• a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general 

• information technology or infrastructure failures including those of a third party supplier or service provider and 

• natural disasters the impacts of climate change or other events beyond applied’s control such as earthquakes utility interruptions tsunamis hurricanes typhoons floods storms or extreme weather conditions fires regional economic downturns regional or global health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic geopolitical turmoil increased trade restrictions between the us and china and other countries social unrest political instability terrorism or acts of war in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing research engineering or other operations 

if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost intellectual property protection sociallyresponsible business practices or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties and may impair applied’s ability to protect enforce and extract the full value of its intellectual property rights as well as the intellectual property rights of its customers’ and other third parties these outcomes could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject applied to legal proceedings and claims in addition if applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all its business results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted 

in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may strain applied’s manufacturing and supply chain operations and negatively impact applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases or commits to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if customers reduce delay or cancel orders applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges 

the continued effects of the covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s operations and financial results 

the continued effects of the covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s supply chain manufacturing logistics workforce and operations as well as the operations of applied’s customers suppliers and partners globally there is continued uncertainty regarding the duration scope and severity of the pandemic particularly with the emergence of new variants of covid19 and periodic spikes in covid19 cases in various geographic regions and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the pandemic and response measures travel and logistics restrictions lockdowns vaccine requirements and other measures from time to time implemented by foreign and domestic authorities have resulted in and may continue to result in supply chain and transportation disruptions production delays and capacity limitations at applied and some of its customers suppliers and partners as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity at applied and customer sites and additional data information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce working remotely 

as economic activity and business operations in certain regions recover there have been and may continue to be periods of significant or sudden increases in demand for applied’s products as well as worldwide demand for electronic products significant or sudden demand increases have resulted in and may continue to result in a shortage of parts materials or services needed to manufacture applied’s products we have also experienced and may continue to experience shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints such shortages or delays have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and do so on favorable terms and our ability to meet our customer demand there can be no assurance that applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at levels necessary to adequately address demand for applied products in addition the pandemic and measures taken in response thereto have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global economic activity and could also result in a reduced demand for our products delayed deliveries or installation cancelled orders or increase in logistics and operating costs and materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts applied’s business financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict including the severity duration and any resurgence of the pandemic the extent duration and effectiveness of periodic lockdowns and other containment actions the availability public adoption and efficacy of covid vaccines how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume and the severity and duration of resulting global economic volatility

• the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs 

applied also makes investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with partners in addition new legislation additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so applied may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or the approvals may come with significant conditions or obligations the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges 

applied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan some divestitures may take the form of applied contributing assets to a joint venture and thus are subject to the joint venture risks discussed above in addition divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals or at all disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions loss of key employees or customers exposure to unanticipated liabilities including among other things those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures and other adverse financial impacts 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

applied’s success competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with the necessary expertise and capabilities representing diverse backgrounds and experiences achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions management or organizational changes increasing competition for talent the availability of qualified employees in the markets availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and the attractiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs and applied’s employment policies including the flexibility of its remotework arrangements we have experienced and may continue to experience increasing costs to attract and retain needed talent driven by macroeconomic conditions and a highly competitive labor market if we are unable to attract retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities which could adversely impact applied’s business and results of operations the loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions which may result in unexpected costs reduced productivity andor difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls 

applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws 

applied is subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in applicable tax laws interpretations of applicable tax laws amount and composition of pretax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates and valuation of deferred tax assets 

beginning in fiscal 2023 the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years although congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement there is no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified if the requirement is not modified it may increase applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates beginning in fiscal 2023 

on august 16 2022 the us government enacted the inflation reduction act which introduces a new 15 corporate minimum tax and includes an excise tax that would impose a 1 surcharge on stock repurchases and which may impact applied’s financial results beginning in fiscal 2024 and 2023 respectively 

there have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that if enacted would increase our tax liability while it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals if enacted they could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate an increase in applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could in turn have a material adverse impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

consistent with the international nature of its business applied conducts certain manufacturing supply chain and other operations in asia bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs in certain foreign jurisdictions conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to applied to obtain the benefit of these tax incentives applied must meet requirements relating to various activities applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met or applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions 

in addition applied is subject to examination by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes which requires estimates and judgments although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates which may be timeconsuming and expensive there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates 

applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business 

applied has 55 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade applied also has in place a 15 billion revolving credit facility while no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of october 30 2022 applied may borrow amounts in the future under this credit facility applied may also enter into new financing arrangements applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section significant changes in applied’s credit rating disruptions in the global financial markets or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings and financial condition if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations or comply with financial and other debt covenants it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied’s obligations there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time 

the failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact applied’s business and results of operations 

applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations align its global organizations and enable future growth implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel training and financial resources and entails risks to applied’s business operations if applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties such as its ability to track orders timely manufacture and ship products project inventory requirements effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources aggregate financial data and report operating results and otherwise effectively manage its business all of which could result in quality issues reputational harm lost market and revenue opportunities and otherwise adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or longlived assets 

applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the review compares the fair value for each of applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value including goodwill factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows declines in the market price of applied common stock changes in applied’s strategies or product portfolio and restructuring activities applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist 

legal compliance and other risks

applied’s pandemic response 

as the covid19 pandemic emerged in 2020 applied materials responded quickly to put in place precautionary measures to keep its workplaces healthy and safe while ensuring compliance with orders and restrictions imposed by government authorities everywhere applied operates in the world applied’s top priority remains protecting the health and safety of its employees and their families customers suppliers and community applied continues to support workplace flexibility and will work to respond appropriately to the impact of covid19 on its business its customers’ and suppliers’ businesses and its communities 

overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the semiconductor display and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips liquid crystal and organic lightemitting diode oled displays and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in electronic products each of applied’s segments is subject to variable industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips display technologies and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic political and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes 

applied operates in three reportable segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in part i item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays spending by semiconductor customers which include companies that operate in the foundry logic memory and other semiconductor chip markets is driven by demand for electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive devices storage and other products the growth of data and emerging endmarket drivers such as artificial intelligence the internet of things 5g networks smart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry as a result products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions increasingly complex chip architectures new materials and an increasing number of applications demand for display manufacturing equipment spending depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for nextgeneration mobile devices and investments in new types of display technologies while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of nextgeneration process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet endmarket demand in light of these conditions applied’s results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter 

applied’s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries and growing its services business applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

  

fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020 each contained 52 weeks while fiscal 2021 contained 53 weeks 

semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions and new capacity during fiscal 2022 foundry and logic spending increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 driven by customer investments in both advanced and mature nodes overall spending by memory customers was flat in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 as they continued to maintain balance between supply and demand and invested in new technology 

applied saw continued growth in its services business in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 driven by an increase in the installed base of equipment the rate of customer equipment utilization longterm service agreements and spares and legacy systems sales applied’s display and adjacent markets revenue decreased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to decreased investment in display manufacturing equipment for tvs and mobile products 

while customer demand increased during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 supply chain and logistics constraints impacted applied’s ability to fulfill demand in fiscal 2022 although there have been improvements in supply chain performance applied expects some shortages to persist into fiscal 2023 and managing these supply chain constraints to increase shipments to customers remains a top priority 

in fiscal 2023 applied expects memory customers’ spending to be lower as compared to fiscal 2022 due to some customers deferring capacity additions as a result of weakness in consumer electronics and personal computer markets advanced foundry and logic demand is expected to remain strong in fiscal 2023 as customers continue to invest in new technology 

on october 7 2022 the united states government announced new export regulations for us semiconductor technology sold in china including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services that require export licenses and authorizations these new export regulations resulted in lower net sales in china than expected for fiscal 2022 applied is pursuing additional export licenses and authorizations where needed while applied currently estimates lower net sales to china of up to 25 billion and lower overall gross margin of up to 1 in fiscal 2023 applied is continuing to assess the implication of these complex regulations to its business see also “risk factors – global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations including import and export license requirements trade sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors” for further details 

in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and evolving conditions and worldwide response applied made adjustments to its global operations and is actively managing its responses in collaboration with its employees customers and suppliers however the situation remains fluid and uncertain for additional risks associated with the ongoing covid19 pandemic see the risk factor entitled “ the continued effects of covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s operations and financial results ” in part i item 1a “risk factors”

during fiscal 2022 applied’s board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 024 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of 026 per share during fiscal 2021 applied’s board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 022 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of 024 per share during fiscal 2020 applied’s board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 021 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of 022 per share dividends paid during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 amounted to 873 million 838 million and 787 million respectively applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied’s financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied’s stockholders 

applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to 16 billion of which 15 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement revolving credit agreement with a group of banks the revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which applied may request an increase in the amount of the facility of up to 500 million for a total commitment of no more than 20 billion subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such increase and other customary conditions the revolving credit agreement is scheduled to expire in february 2025 unless extended as permitted under the revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars that bear interest for each advance at one of two rates selected by applied plus an applicable margin which varies according to applied’s public debt credit ratings in july 2022 applied entered into an amendment to the revolving credit agreement which replaced the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference rate for borrowings with the secured overnight financing rate sofr the revolving credit agreement includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance as of october 30 2022 

remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately 54 million are with japanese banks applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen 

applied has a shortterm commercial paper program under which applied may issue unsecured commercial paper notes of up to a total amount of 15 billion as of october 30 2022 applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022 applied issued 200 million of shortterm commercial paper with a weightedaverage interest rate of 430 and maturities ranging from 43 days to 71 days the commercial paper program is backstopped by the revolving credit agreement and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement reduce the amount of commercial paper notes applied can issue 

applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of 55 billion outstanding as of october 30 2022 see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional discussion of existing debt applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on applied’s capital requirements and the availability of financing 

others 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax act the tax act requires a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the transition tax expense is payable in installments over eight years with eight percent due in each of the first five years starting with fiscal 2018 as of october 30 2022 applied had 694 million of total payments remaining payable in installments in the next four years 

beginning in fiscal 2023 the tax act eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years although congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement there is no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified if the requirement is not modified it may reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal 2023 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

for details on standby letters of credit guarantee instruments and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

applied has certain onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet obligation arrangements to make future payments under various contracts certain contractual arrangements which are recorded on applied’s balance sheet include borrowing facilities and debts and operating leases obligations 

borrowing facilities and debt obligations 

as of october 30 2022 applied has 55 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with varying maturities future interest payments associated with these unsecured notes were 30 billion of which 205 million is due within 12 months and the remaining interest payments are due beyond 12 months see note 10  borrowing facilities and debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to applied’s borrowing facilities and debt obligations 

operating lease obligations 

as of october 30 2022 applied’s operating lease obligation was 407 million related to various operating lease arrangements for certain facilities and equipment see note 11 lease of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to these operating lease obligations 

purchase obligations 

as of october 30 2022 applied has 73 billion of purchase obligations for goods and services of which 70 billion is payable within 12 months and the remaining amount is payable beyond 12 months 

deemed repatriation tax payable 

as of october 30 2022 applied has 694 million of transition tax liability of which 82 million is payable within 12 months and the remaining amount is payable beyond 12 months this transition tax liability is associated with the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act into law on december 22 2017 

other longterm liabilities 

applied also has the obligation to fund its pension postretirement and deferred compensation plans applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants making the timing of payments uncertain information on applied’s pension postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 14 employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

as of october 30 2022 the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was 489 million interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 30 2022 was 103 million at this time applied is unable to reliably estimate the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries these include agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit see note 16 warranty guarantees commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to these arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services performance obligations are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services applied performs the following five steps to determine when to recognize revenue 1 identification of the contracts with customers 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognition of revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied management uses judgment to identify performance obligations within a contract and to determine whether multiple promised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group judgment is also used in interpreting commercial terms and determining when transfer of control occurs moreover judgment is used to estimate the contract’s transaction price and allocate it to each performance obligation any material changes in the identification of performance obligations determination and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations and determination of when transfer of control occurs to the customer could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for credit losses 

applied maintains an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a firstin firstout fifo basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment especially in emerging markets when reviewing goodwill for impairment applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

in performing a qualitative assessment applied considers business conditions and other factors including but not limited to i adverse industry or economic trends ii restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results iii sustained decline in share price and iv overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units if applied concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value applied would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value 

applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain under the income approach applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method 

the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business and considers any significant developments during the period under the discounted cash flow method cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate which considers the longterm earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit’s target capital structure in addition the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied’s current international structure which is consistent with the market participant perspective under the market approach applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publiclytraded companies and considers each reporting unit’s size growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies 

intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 

income taxes 

applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized 

applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes 

the calculation of applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted financial results 

management uses nongaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes and as performance measures in its executive compensation program applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of applied’s ongoing operating performance 

the nongaap adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions restructuring and severance charges and any associated adjustments certain incremental expenses related to covid19 impairments of assets gain or loss on strategic investments loss on early extinguishment of debt certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments reconciliations of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because the nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

applied is exposed to financial market risks including fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

availableforsale debt securities the market value of applied’s investments in availableforsale securities was approximately 18 billion at october 30 2022 an immediate hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of investments as of october 30 2022 of approximately 23 million 

debt at october 30 2022 the aggregate principal of longterm senior unsecured notes issued by applied was 55 billion with an estimated fair value of 48 billion a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied’s longterm senior notes issuances of approximately 454 million at october 30 2022 from time to time applied uses interest rate swaps or rate lock agreements to mitigate the potential impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on interest expense and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen israeli shekel euro and taiwanese dollar hedges are used to reduce but not eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the consolidated balance sheet statement of operations and statement of cash flows 

applied uses primarily foreign currency forward contracts to offset the impact of foreign exchange movements on nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities the foreign exchange gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other income net and are offset by the gains and losses on the hedges 

applied uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated nonus dollar denominated revenues and expenses expected to occur within the next 24 months gains and losses on these hedging contracts generally mitigate the effect of currency movements on applied’s net sales cost of products sold and operating expenses a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these hedging contracts of 196 million at october 30 2022 

applied does not use foreign currency forward or option contracts for trading or speculative purposes

backlog 

applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order backlog and customer commitments backlog consisted of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 31 2021 and october 25 2020 was as follows 



of the total backlog as of october 31 2021 approximately 21 is not reasonably expected to be filled within the next 12 months 

applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or order cancellations customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

applied’s worldwide manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly integration and test of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries including germany israel singapore taiwan the united states and other countries in asia applied uses qualified vendors including contract manufacturers to supply parts services and product support applied’s supply chain strategy adheres to ethical labor practices responsible minerals sourcing responsible business alliance and semi guidelines and the applied materials standards of business conduct as defined in applied’s environmental social and governance esg commitment 

although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a qualified single supplier or a limited group of qualified suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for parts monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers maintaining appropriate inventories of parts qualifying new parts on a timely basis and ensuring quality and performance of parts 

research development and engineering 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering rde must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers and ecosystem partners to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements 

applied’s product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in china europe india israel singapore and taiwan in addition certain outsourced rde activities process support and customer demonstrations are performed in the united states india china singapore and taiwan 

marketing and sales

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s operations and financial results 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact applied’s supply chain manufacturing logistics workforce and operations as well as the operations of applied’s customers suppliers and partners globally there is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures travel and logistics restrictions shelterinplace orders and other measures including working remotely social distancing and other policies implemented in foreign and domestic sites have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in transportation disruptions such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures production delays and capacity limitations at applied and some of its customers suppliers and partners as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity at applied and customer sites and additional data information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce now working remotely fulltime 

while economic activity and business operations in certain regions continue to recover there may be periods of significant or sudden increases in demand for applied’s products as well as worldwide demand for electronic products significant or sudden demand increases may result in a shortage of parts materials or services needed to manufacture applied’s products or may cause shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints such shortages or delays could adversely impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and our ability to meet our customer demand there can be no assurance that applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at current levels or at increased levels that may be necessary to address demand for applied products in addition the pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global economic activity and could also result in a reduced demand for our products delayed deliveries or installation cancelled orders or increase in logistics and operating costs and materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the degree to which the ongoing pandemic ultimately impacts applied’s business financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict including the severity duration and any resurgence of the pandemic the extent and effectiveness of containment actions the availability public adoption and efficacy of covid vaccines effectiveness of government stimulus programs how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume and the severity and duration of the global economic volatility that results from the ongoing pandemic additionally applied has a multiphase plan to return to working onsite which gradually allows additional workers to return onsite while practicing social distancing and other safety measures however there is no assurance that such plan and safety measures will be effective in preventing the inadvertent transmission of covid19 within the workplace further implementation of such plan could adversely impact applied’s operations 

risks associated with operating a global business 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

applied has product development engineering manufacturing sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas moreover in fiscal 2021 approximately 91 of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states as a result of the global nature of its operations applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

• uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands 

• political and social attitudes laws rules regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over nondomestic companies including customer or governmentsupported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors 

• direct and indirect global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies trade sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes including the rules and interpretations promulgated by the us department of commerce expanding export license requirements for certain products sold to certain entities in china 

• customer or governmentsupported efforts to influence applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country such as korea and china 

• variations among and changes in local regional national or international laws and regulations including contract intellectual property cybersecurity data privacy labor tax and importexport laws and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations 

• ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries 

• positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial andor security issues posed by international business operations 

• fluctuating raw material commodity energy and shipping costs 

• delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between and within countries 

• geographically diverse operations and projects and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes procedures and internal controls and comply with environmental health and safety anticorruption and other regulatory requirements 

• supply chain interruptions and service interruptions from utilities transportation data hosting or telecommunications providers or other events beyond our control 

• failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels languages cultures customs business practices and worker expectations and differing employment practices and labor issues 

• variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers suppliers and governments 

• fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates including the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar against the japanese yen israeli shekel euro taiwanese dollar singapore dollar chinese yuan or korean won 

• the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world 

• performance of thirdparty providers of outsourced functions including certain engineering software development manufacturing information technology and other activities 

• political instability natural disasters regional or global health epidemics social unrest terrorism or acts of war in locations where applied has operations suppliers or sales or that may influence the value chain of the industries that applied serves 

• impacts of climate change on the operations of applied its customers and suppliers 

• challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries 

• the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions and 

• uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries 

as more fully discussed in the risk factor “the ongoing covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s operations and financial results” above the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact applied’s supply chain manufacturing logistics workforce and operations as well as the operations of applied’s customers suppliers and partners globally 

international trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could adversely impact our operations and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors 

we sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the united states including china taiwan japan and korea we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the united states there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among the united states and the countries in which we conduct our business that political diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes impacts andor disruptions in particular with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry the united states and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods increases in tariffs additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact enduser demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

for example certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses and our inability to obtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and impact our business the us department of commerce has promulgated several rules and interpretations expanding export license requirements for us companies that sell certain products to entities in china whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to china and added certain chinese companies including one of the company’s customers to its “entity list” these rules and interpretations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products to such customer in china obtaining export licenses may be difficult costly and timeconsuming and our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in china and adversely affect our results of operations the implementation and interpretation of these rules are ongoing and their impact on our business is uncertain and these rules and other regulatory changes that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations the us and other governmental agencies may in the future promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting the company’s ability to provide certain of its products to customers outside the us including china 

in addition government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies require the license or other transfer of intellectual property or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business many of these challenges are present in china and korea markets that represent a significant portion of applied’s current business as well as longterm growth opportunities 

applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy 

uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets national debt fiscal or monetary concerns inflation and rising interest rates in various regions could materially adversely impact applied’s operating results markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions that result in decreases in consumer spending and demand or cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers may cause certain of our customers to push out cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and our operating results in addition the covid19 pandemic and transportation interruptions and other measures taken in response thereto have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global and regional economic activity as well as our ability to meet our customer demand 

similarly changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products for example as a result of the reopening of the economy with the easing of covid19 related restrictions have resulted in and may continue to result in a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products such shortages as well as shipment delays due to transportation interruptions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements in addition lunar new year and other holidays in the countries in which we or our suppliers operate may reduce the level of business activities during such times and thus adversely impact our and our suppliers’ ability to manufacture and deliver products supplies and services accelerated digital transformation may further increase consumer demand and exacerbate such shortages and also strain our manufacturing capacity which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands and thus have an adverse impact on our revenues results of operations and financial condition 

uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations if applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings 

applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate including from impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts which could affect its ability to manage its operations 

risks associated with applied’s industry 

the industries that applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries applied is subject to variable industry conditions since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies enduser demand customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions applied’s industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology these changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on applied’s net sales operating expenses gross margins and net income the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on applied’s results of operations 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand including as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its effects its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs during periods of decreasing demand applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated particularly in china taiwan and korea a relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of applied’s business as a result the actions of even a single customer can expose applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility the geographic concentration of applied’s customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer including as a result of changes in government policy have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year and have had and may continue to have a significant impact on applied’s net sales gross margins and net income applied’s products are configured to customer specifications and changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders including as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic or our inability to fulfill orders due to a shortage of parts transportation interruptions or any other reason applied may not be able to replace the business which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition the concentration of applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on applied’s results of operations and cash flow to the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints applied may incur bad debt expense which may have a significant impact on its results of operations major customers may also seek pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied which may have a negative impact on applied’s business cash flow revenue and gross margins 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor display and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s products and its consolidated results of operations including 

• the nature timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic conditions seasonality or the introduction of new products and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for applied’s products 

• increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital 

• trade regulatory tax or government incentive policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants 

• differences in growth rates among the semiconductor display and other industries in which applied operates 

• the increasing importance of establishing improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers 

• the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology 

• the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership 

• the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity device yield and reliability 

• manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and reuse fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment

• increasing government incentives for local suppliers 

• the increasing role for and complexity of software in applied products and 

• the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

the largest proportion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor systems segment to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products including 

• the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections and applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes 

• the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors including shrinking geometries the use of new materials new and more complex device structures more applications and process steps increasing chip design costs and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes 

• the need to reduce product development time despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges 

• the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes 

• the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment 

• challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that applied does not serve such as lithography or segments where applied’s products have lower relative market presence 

• the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand 

• semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and reuse equipment resulting in diminished need to purchase new equipment and services from us and challenges in providing parts for reused equipment 

• shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment which may lead to inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin 

• competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position including challenges in securing developmenttoolofrecord dtor and productiontoolofrecord ptor positions with customers 

• consolidation in the semiconductor industry including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers 

• shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies that impact the equipment requirements of applied’s foundry customers

• the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant while others require less technologically advanced products and 

• the growing importance of specialty markets such as internet of things communications automotive power and sensors that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry 

if applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies and effectively address industry trends its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry 

the global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers the concentrated nature of enduse applications production capacity relative to enduse demand and panel manufacturer profitability industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s display products and services including 

• the importance of new types of display technologies such as organic lightemitting diode oled low temperature polysilicon ltps and metal oxide transistor backplanes flexible displays and new touch panel films 

• the increasing cost of research and development and complexity of technology transitions and inflections and applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes 

• the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in china which may be affected by changes in local economic conditions and governmental policies in china korea japan and the united states 

• the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand 

• the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for tvs and to new display technologies for tvs it products and mobile applications and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on applied’s product differentiation gross margin and return on investment and 

• fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies and uncertainty with respect to future display technology enduse applications and growth drivers 

if applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes 

applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical and its future success depends on many factors including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment services and related products and its ability to increase its position in its current markets expand into adjacent and new markets and optimize operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants have grown more complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs longer development cycles lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects to compete successfully applied must 

• identify and address technology inflections market changes competitor innovations new applications customer requirements and enduse demand in a timely and effective manner 

• develop new products and disruptive technologies improve and develop new applications for existing products and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements 

• differentiate its products from those of competitors meet customers’ performance specifications including those related to energy consumption and environmental impact more broadly appropriately price products and achieve market acceptance 

• maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets applications customers and customer requirements

• qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers and 

• implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems and improve product life cycle management 

if applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections develop and commercialize new products and technologies and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

risks related to applied’s business finance and operations 

supply chain disruptions manufacturing interruptions or delays or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand lead to higher costs or result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts materials and services including components and subassemblies from suppliers and contract manufacturers significant and sudden increases in demand for applied’s products as well as worldwide demand for electronic products have resulted in and may continue to result in a shortage of parts materials and services needed to manufacture applied’s products such shortages as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts materials or services and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand some key parts are subject to long leadtimes or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can increase capital technical operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses or scale back or cease operations which could impact our ability to meet customer demand 

applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver or install products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

• the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a costeffective basis 

• volatility in the availability and cost of parts materials or services including rising prices due to inflation 

• difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals 

• shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints 

• a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general 

• information technology or infrastructure failures including those of a third party supplier or service provider and 

• natural disasters the impacts of climate change or other events beyond applied’s control such as earthquakes utility interruptions tsunamis hurricanes typhoons floods storms or extreme weather conditions fires regional economic downturns regional or global health epidemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic geopolitical turmoil increased trade restrictions between the us and china and other countries social unrest political instability terrorism or acts of war in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing research engineering or other operations 

as more fully discussed in the risk factor “the ongoing covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s operations and financial results” above the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact applied’s supply chain manufacturing logistics workforce and operations as well as the operations of applied’s customers suppliers and partners globally 

if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost intellectual property protection sociallyresponsible business practices or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties and may impair applied’s ability to protect enforce and extract the full value of its intellectual property rights as well as the intellectual property rights of its customers’ and other third parties these outcomes could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject applied to legal proceedings and claims in addition if applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all its business results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted 

in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may strain applied’s manufacturing and supply chain operations and negatively impact applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases or commits to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if customers reduce delay or cancel orders applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges 

applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations acquisitions strategic investments and divestitures 

applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied business combinations acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to applied’s business financial condition and operating results including but not limited to 

• inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals litigation or other disputes and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee 

• diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses 

• the failure to realize expected revenues gross and operating margins net income and other returns from acquired businesses 

• requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction which may include among other things divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of applied’s existing business or the acquired business 

• following completion of acquisitions ineffective integration of businesses operations systems digital and physical security technologies products employees compliance programs changes in laws or regulations including tax laws or other factors may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits 

• failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments 

• dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners 

• inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships 

• failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses 

• the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties 

• potential changes in applied’s credit rating which could adversely impact the company’s access to and cost of capital 

• reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction which increase interest expense and reductions in cash balances which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes including share repurchases and dividends 

• exposure to new operational risks rules regulations worker expectations customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where applied has not historically conducted business 

• challenges associated with managing new more diverse and more widespread operations projects and people 

• inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies 

• inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls disclosure controls and procedures cybersecurity privacy policies and compliance programs or environmental health and safety anticorruption human resource or other policies or practices 

• impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the segment 

• the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction 

• unknown underestimated undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities or noncompliance with laws regulations or policies and 

• the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs 

applied also makes investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with partners in addition new legislation additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so applied may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or the approvals may come with significant conditions or obligations the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges 

applied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan some divestitures may take the form of applied contributing assets to a joint venture and thus are subject to the joint venture risks discussed above in addition divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals or at all disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions loss of key employees or customers exposure to unanticipated liabilities including among other things those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures and other adverse financial impacts 

applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries 

as part of its growth strategy applied seeks to expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or those developed in collaboration with third parties or obtained through acquisitions applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

• the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for and operate in new markets 

• the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements 

• differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses 

• applied’s ability to anticipate demand capitalize on opportunities and avoid or minimize risks 

• the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning execution supply chain management and logistics 

• the adoption of new business models business processes and systems 

• the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities 

• new materials processes and technologies 

• the need to attract motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas 

• new and more diverse customers and suppliers including some with limited operating histories uncertain or limited funding evolving business models or locations in regions where applied does not have or has limited operations 

• new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources industry experience and established customer relationships 

• entry into new industries and countries with differing levels of government involvement laws and regulations and business employment and safety practices 

• third parties’ intellectual property rights and 

• the need to comply with or work to establish industry standards and practices 

in addition applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied is often subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

applied’s success competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities representing diverse backgrounds and experiences achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions management changes applied’s organizational structure increasing local and global competition for talent the availability of qualified employees in the local and global markets cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and the attractiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs if we are unable to attract retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities which could adversely impact applied’s business and results of operations the loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions which may result in unexpected costs reduced productivity andor difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls 

applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws 

applied is subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in applicable tax laws interpretations of applicable tax laws amount and composition of pretax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates and valuation of deferred tax assets there have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that if enacted would increase our tax liability while it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals if enacted they could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate an increase in applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could in turn have a material adverse impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

consistent with the international nature of its business applied conducts certain manufacturing supply chain and other operations in asia bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs in certain foreign jurisdictions conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to applied to obtain the benefit of these tax incentives applied must meet requirements relating to various activities applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met or applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions 

in addition applied is subject to examination by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes which requires estimates and judgments although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates which may be timeconsuming and expensive there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates 

applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business 

applied has 55 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade applied also has in place a 15 billion revolving credit facility while no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of october 31 2021 applied may borrow amounts in the future under this credit facility applied may also enter into new financing arrangements applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section significant changes in applied’s credit rating disruptions in the global financial markets or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings and financial condition if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations or comply with financial and other debt covenants it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied’s obligations there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time 

the failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact applied’s business and results of operations 

applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations align its global organizations and enable future growth implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel training and financial resources and entails risks to applied’s business operations if applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties such as its ability to track orders timely manufacture and ship products project inventory requirements effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources aggregate financial data and report operating results and otherwise effectively manage its business all of which could result in quality issues reputational harm lost market and revenue opportunities and otherwise adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or longlived assets 

applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the review compares the fair value for each of applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value including goodwill factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows declines in the market price of applied common stock changes in applied’s strategies or product portfolio and restructuring activities applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist 

risks related to intellectual property and cybersecurity 

applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its technology using patents trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied monitoring and detecting any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the protective measures it has implemented will completely prevent misuse applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries if applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable and others may seek counterclaims against applied which could have a negative impact on its business if applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights or if they are circumvented rendered obsolete or invalidated by the rapid pace of technological change it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business in addition changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications or related enforcement actions and diminish the value and competitive advantage conferred by applied’s intellectual property assets 

third parties may also assert claims against applied and its products claims that applied’s products infringe the rights of others whether or not meritorious can be expensive and timeconsuming to defend and resolve and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel the inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on applied’s business in addition applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential business information any such incidents and claims could severely harm applied’s business and reputation result in significant expenses harm its competitive position and prevent applied from selling certain products all of which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business and results of operations 

applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents

overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the semiconductor display and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips liquid crystal and organic lightemitting diode oled displays and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components each of applied’s businesses is subject to variable industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips display technologies and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes 

applied operates in three reportable segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in part i item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays spending by semiconductor customers which include companies that operate in the foundry logic and memory markets is driven by demand for advanced electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive devices storage and other products the growth of data and emerging endmarket drivers such as artificial intelligence the internet of things 5g networks smart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry as a result products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions increasingly complex chip architectures new materials and an increasing number of applications demand for display manufacturing equipment spending depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for nextgeneration mobile devices and investments in new types of display technologies while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of nextgeneration process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet endmarket demand in light of these conditions applied’s results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter 

applied’s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries and growing its services business applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements

interest expense and interest and other income loss net 

interest expense and interest and other income loss net for the periods indicated were as follows 

interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes interest expense in fiscal 2021 remained relatively flat compared fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 due to the average principal balance of the senior unsecured notes remained consistent at 55 billion in each of the last three years 

interest and other income net in fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily driven by a higher net gain from equity investments partially offset by lower interest income during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 interest and other income net in fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily driven by lower interest income and a loss on early extinguishment of debt in addition unrealized gains on equity investment securities from investments during fiscal 2020 were lower compared to fiscal 2019 

income taxes 

provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods indicated were as follows 

applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

applied’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was slightly lower than fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher proportion of pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions partially offset by resolutions of prior years’ income tax filings applied’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decline in the tax expense from changes to uncertain tax positions yearoveryear an increased tax benefit from tax credits and increased excess stock compensation tax benefits this benefit was partly offset by an unfavorable settlement of an uncertain tax position in fiscal 2020 

on june 14 2019 the us government released regulations that significantly affect how the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provision of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act is interpreted as a result applied reversed a tax benefit of 96 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that had been realized in the first half of fiscal 2019 an accounting policy may be selected to treat gilti temporary differences in taxable income either as a currentperiod expense when incurred period cost method or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes deferred method applied has chosen the period cost method 

segment information 

applied reports financial results in three segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the corporate and other category includes revenues from products as well as costs of products sold for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to its reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level these operating expenses include costs for sharebased compensation certain management finance legal human resource and rde functions provided at the corporate level and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy in addition applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring severance and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment

others 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax act the tax act requires a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the transition tax expense is payable in installments over eight years with eight percent due in each of the first five years starting with fiscal 2018 as of october 31 2021 applied had 775 million of total payments remaining payable in installments in the next five years before the tax act us income tax had not been provided for certain unrepatriated earnings that were considered indefinitely reinvested income tax is now provided for all unrepatriated earnings 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

for details on standby letters of credit guarantee instruments and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries these include agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements as of october 31 2021 the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 500 million applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements 

applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit as of october 31 2021 applied has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately 144 million to cover these arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 31 2021 

  

 

1 represents the transition tax liability associated with the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act into law on december 22 2017 

2 represents applied’s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied’s outstanding purchase orders for goods and services 

3 other longterm liabilities in the table do not include pension postretirement and deferred compensation plans due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants making the timing of payments uncertain information on applied’s pension postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 15 employee benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements 

4 applied’s other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets include deferred income tax liabilities gross unrecognized tax benefits and related gross interest and penalties as of october 31 2021 the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was 524 million interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 31 2021 was 88 million at this time applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services performance obligations are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services applied performs the following five steps to determine when to recognize revenue 1 identification of the contracts with customers 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognition of revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied management uses judgment to identify performance obligations within a contract and to determine whether multiple promised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group judgment is also used in interpreting commercial terms and determining when transfer of control occurs moreover judgment is used to estimate the contract’s transaction price and allocate it to each performance obligation any material changes in the identification of performance obligations determination and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations and determination of when transfer of control occurs to the customer could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for credit losses 

applied maintains an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a firstin firstout fifo basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment especially in emerging markets when reviewing goodwill for impairment applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

in performing a qualitative assessment applied considers business conditions and other factors including but not limited to i adverse industry or economic trends ii restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results iii sustained decline in share price and iv overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units if applied concludes that is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value applied would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its fair value 

applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain under the income approach applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method 

the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business and considers any significant developments during the period under the discounted cash flow method cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate which considers the longterm earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit’s target capital structure in addition the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied’s current international structure which is consistent with the market participant perspective under the market approach applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publiclytraded companies and considers each reporting unit’s size growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies 

intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 

income taxes 

applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized 

applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes 

the calculation of applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have an adverse material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted financial results 

management uses nongaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes and as performance measures in its executive compensation program applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of applied’s ongoing operating performance 

the nongaap adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions restructuring and severance charges and any associated adjustments certain incremental expenses related to covid19 impairments of assets gain or loss on strategic investments loss on early extinguishment of debt certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments additionally nongaap results exclude estimated discrete income tax expense items associated with us tax legislation reconciliations of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because the nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

applied is exposed to financial market risks including fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

availableforsale debt securities the market value of applieds investments in availableforsales securities was approximately 18 billion at october 31 2021 an immediate hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of investments as of october 31 2021 of approximately 26 million 

debt at october 31 2021 the aggregate principal of longterm senior unsecured notes issued by applied was 55 billion with an estimated fair value of 64 billion a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied’s longterm senior notes issuances of approximately 731 million at october 31 2021 from time to time applied uses interest rate swaps or rate lock agreements to mitigate the potential impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on interest expense and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen israeli shekel euro and taiwanese dollar hedges are used to reduce but not eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the consolidated balance sheet statement of operations and statement of cash flows 

applied uses primarily foreign currency forward contracts to offset the impact of foreign exchange movements on nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities the foreign exchange gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other income net and are offset by the gains and losses on the hedges 

applied uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated nonus dollar denominated revenues and expenses expected to occur within the next 24 months gains and losses on these hedging contracts generally mitigate the effect of currency movements on applied’s net sales cost of products sold and operating expenses a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these hedging contracts of 177 million at october 31 2021 

applied does not use foreign currency forward or option contracts for trading or speculative purposes

backlog 

applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order backlog and customer commitments backlog consisted of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 25 2020 and october 27 2019 was as follows 



of the total backlog as of october 25 2020 approximately 16 is not reasonably expected to be filled within the next 12 months 

applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or order cancellations customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

applied’s worldwide manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly integration and test of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries including germany israel italy mexico singapore taiwan the united states and other countries in asia applied uses qualified vendors including contract manufacturers to supply parts services and product support 

although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a qualified single supplier or a limited group of qualified suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for parts monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers maintaining appropriate inventories of parts qualifying new parts on a timely basis and ensuring quality and performance of parts 

research development and engineering 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering rde must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers and ecosystem partners to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements 

applied’s product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in china europe india israel singapore and taiwan in addition certain outsourced rde activities process support and customer demonstrations are performed in the united states india china singapore and taiwan 

marketing and sales

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s operations and financial results 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread including quarantines facility closures travel and logistics restrictions border controls and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact applied’s supply chain manufacturing logistics workforce and operations as well as the operations of applied’s customers suppliers and partners globally there is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures while applied continues to see progress in the recovery within its supply chain travel and logistics restrictions shelterinplace orders and other measures including working remotely social distancing and other policies implemented in foreign and domestic sites to protect the health and safety of employees have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in transportation disruptions such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures production delays and capacity limitations at applied and some of its customers suppliers and partners as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity at applied and customer sites and additional data information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce now working remotely fulltime there can be no assurance that applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at current levels in addition the pandemic and the impact of the foregoing measures in various forms and in varying degrees have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global economic activity and could also result in a reduced demand for our products delayed deliveries or installation cancelled orders or increase in logistics and operating costs and materially adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts applied’s financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict including the severity and duration of the pandemic the extent and effectiveness of containment actions availability of effective vaccines against covid19 effectiveness of government stimulus programs resurgence of covid19 how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that results from the pandemic 

risks associated with operating a global business 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

applied has product development engineering manufacturing sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas moreover in fiscal 2020 approximately 90 of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states as a result of the global nature of its operations applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

• uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands 

• political and social attitudes laws rules regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over nondomestic companies including customer or governmentsupported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors 

• direct and indirect global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies including the impact of the implementation and interpretation of the rules published by the us department of commerce on april 28 2020 and august 17 2020 relating to certain export license requirements and the ability to obtain required import and export licenses trade sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes 

• customer or governmentsupported efforts to influence applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country such as korea and china 

• variations among and changes in local regional national or international laws and regulations including contract intellectual property cybersecurity data privacy labor tax and importexport laws and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations 

• ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries 

• positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial andor security issues posed by international business operations 

• fluctuating raw material commodity energy and shipping costs 

• delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between and within countries 

• geographically diverse operations and projects and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes procedures and internal controls and comply with environmental health and safety anticorruption and other regulatory requirements 

• supply chain interruptions and service interruptions from utilities transportation data hosting or telecommunications providers or other events beyond our control 

• failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels languages cultures customs business practices and worker expectations and differing employment practices and labor issues 

• variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers suppliers and governments 

• fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates including the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar against the japanese yen israeli shekel euro taiwanese dollar singapore dollar chinese yuan or korean won 

• the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world 

• performance of third party providers of outsourced functions including certain engineering software development manufacturing information technology and other activities 

• political instability natural disasters regional or global health epidemics social unrest terrorism or acts of war in locations where applied has operations suppliers or sales or that may influence the value chain of the industries that applied serves

• the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions and 

• uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries 

as more fully discussed in the risk factor “the ongoing covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s operations and financial results” above the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread including quarantines facility closures travel and logistics restrictions border controls and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact applied’s supply chain manufacturing logistics workforce and operations as well as the operations of applied’s customers suppliers and partners globally 

international trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could adversely impact our operations and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors 

we sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the united states including china taiwan japan and korea we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the united states there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china taiwan japan korea and the united states that political diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes impacts andor disruptions in particular with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry the united states and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods increases in tariffs additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact enduser demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses and our inability to obtain such licenses have limited and could further limit our markets and impact our business for example on april 28 2020 the us department of commerce published rules which became effective on june 29 2020 that expanded export license requirements for us companies that sell certain products to entities in china whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses and eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to china on september 25 2020 the us department of commerce designated a certain customer in china as a military end user these trade restrictions and their interpretation by the us department of commerce require us to apply for additional export licenses for certain of our products sold to certain customers in china including products sold to customers that the us department of commerce has determined to present a risk of diversion to a military end use obtaining export licenses may be difficult costly and timeconsuming and our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in china and adversely affect our results of operations the implementation and interpretation of these rules are ongoing and their impact on our business is uncertain and these rules and other regulatory changes that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations additionally on august 17 2020 the us department of commerce published a final rule that does not impose additional license requirements for the export of applied’s products but could require certain of applied’s customers to obtain licenses for the export of wafers chipsets and certain related items to huawei or its affiliates that are the direct product of usorigin semiconductor manufacturing equipment and thus could potentially limit the demand for certain of applied’s products from such customers 

in addition government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies require the license or other transfer of intellectual property or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business many of these challenges are present in china and korea markets that represent a significant portion of applied’s current business as well as longterm growth opportunities 

applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy 

uncertain global economic and business conditions along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions pose challenges to the industries in which applied operates markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services which may have an adverse impact on applied’s revenues results of operations and financial condition uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

in particular impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic have resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets increases in levels of unemployment and economic uncertainty and may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending demand for our products the ability of our customers to pay our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers 

uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations if applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings 

applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate including from impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts which could affect its ability to manage its operations 

risks associated with applied’s industry 

the industries that applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries applied is subject to variable industry conditions since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies enduser demand customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions applied’s industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology these changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on applied’s net sales operating expenses gross margins and net income the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on applied’s results of operations 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand including as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its effects its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs during periods of decreasing demand applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated particularly in china taiwan and korea a relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of applied’s business as a result the actions of even a single customer can expose applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer including as a result of changes in government policy have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year and have a significant impact on applied’s net sales gross margins and net income applied’s products are configured to customer specifications and changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders including as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic applied may not be able to replace the business which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition the concentration of applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on applied’s results of operations and cash flow to the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints applied may incur additional bad debt expense which may have a significant impact on its results of operations major customers may also seek pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied which may have a negative impact on applied’s business cash flow revenue and gross margins 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor display and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s products and its consolidated results of operations including

in addition applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied is often subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

supply chain disruptions manufacturing interruptions or delays or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand lead to higher costs or result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts including components and subassemblies from suppliers including contract manufacturers the inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of parts can have an adverse impact on applied’s manufacturing operations and ability to meet customer demand for equipment spares and services some key parts are subject to long leadtimes or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital technical operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver or install products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

• the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a costeffective basis 

• volatility in the availability and cost of materials 

• difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals 

• shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints 

• information technology or infrastructure failures including those of a third party supplier or service provider and 

• natural disasters or other events beyond applied’s control such as earthquakes utility interruptions tsunamis hurricanes typhoons floods storms or extreme weather conditions fires regional economic downturns regional or global health epidemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic geopolitical turmoil increased trade restrictions between the us and china and other countries social unrest political instability terrorism or acts of war in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing research engineering or other operations 

as more fully discussed in the risk factor “the ongoing covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s operations and financial results” above the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread including quarantines facility closures travel and logistics restrictions border controls and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact applied’s supply chain manufacturing logistics workforce and operations as well as the operations of applied’s customers suppliers and partners globally 

if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost protection of intellectual property sociallyresponsible business practices or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources which could entail manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties and may also result in a loss of applied’s ability to protect enforce and extract the full value of its or its customers’ and other third parties’ intellectual property rights which could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject applied to legal proceedings and claims if applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components it could affect its ability to manage its operations and have an adverse impact on applied’s business results of operations and customer relationships in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if customers reduce or delay orders applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

applied’s success competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities representing diverse backgrounds and experiences achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions management changes applied’s organizational structure increasing global competition for talent the availability of qualified employees in the local and global markets cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and the attractiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs if we are unable to attract retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities which could adversely impact applied’s business and results of operations the loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions which may result in unexpected costs reduced productivity andor difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls 

the failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact applied’s business and results of operations 

applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations align its global organizations and enable future growth implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel training and financial resources and entails risks to applied’s business operations if applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties such as its ability to track orders timely manufacture and ship products project inventory requirements effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources aggregate financial data and report operating results and otherwise effectively manage its business all of which could result in quality issues reputational harm lost market and revenue opportunities and otherwise adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or longlived assets 

applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the review compares the fair value for each of applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value including goodwill factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows declines in the market price of applied common stock changes in applied’s strategies or product portfolio and restructuring activities applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist 

risks related to intellectual property and cybersecurity 

applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries if applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable and others may seek counterclaims against applied which could have a negative impact on its business if applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights or if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business in addition changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents and diminish the value of applied’s intellectual property 

third parties may also assert claims against applied and its products claims that applied’s products infringe the rights of others whether or not meritorious can be expensive and timeconsuming to defend and resolve and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel the inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on applied’s business in addition applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential business information any such incidents and claims could severely harm applied’s business and reputation result in significant expenses harm its competitive position and prevent applied from selling certain products all of which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business and results of operations

applied’s pandemic response 

applied materials’ business has been identified by the us department of homeland security as part of the critical infrastructure sectors that the federal government deems “essential to ensure the continuity of functions critical to public health and safety as well as economic and national security” and that have “a special responsibility in these times to continue operations” 

applied responded quickly to put in place precautionary measures to keep its workplaces healthy and safe while ensuring compliance with orders and restrictions imposed by government authorities everywhere applied operates in the world 

applied’s top priority during the ongoing covid19 pandemic remains protecting the health and safety of its employees and their families customers and community applied continues to maintain workplace flexibility such as working remotely where possible to reduce the number of people who are on campus each day applied is keeping its critical labs and operations active and continuing to support customers in the interest of public health all onsite operations are utilizing the minimum number of people to safely execute tasks and following enhanced safety and health protocols—including screenings social distancing and use of personal protective equipment 

applied has a multiphase plan to return to working onsite which takes into consideration factors such as applied’s business needs local government regulations community case trends and recommendation from public health officials the plan involves multiple phases that gradually allow additional workers to return onsite while practicing social distancing and other safety measures 

applied materials is committed to helping those most impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic in regions around the world applied and its foundation are addressing immediate humanitarian needs while investing resources to combat the longterm effect of the virus on the nonprofit organizations in its communities applied has shared masks and equipment with medical facilities provided blood analysis systems to medical professionals and sent emergency support to food banks 

applied will continue to monitor and evaluate the ongoing covid19 pandemic and will work to respond appropriately to the impact of covid19 on its business its customers’ and suppliers’ businesses and its communities 

overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the semiconductor display and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips liquid crystal and organic lightemitting diode oled displays and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components each of applied’s businesses is subject to variable industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips display technologies and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes 

applied operates in three reportable segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in part i item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays spending by semiconductor customers which include companies that operate in the foundry logic and memory markets is driven by demand for advanced electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive devices storage and other products the growth of data and emerging endmarket drivers such as artificial intelligence the internet of things 5g networks smart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry as a result products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions increasingly complex chip architectures new materials and an increasing number of applications demand for display manufacturing equipment spending depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for nextgeneration mobile devices and investments in new types of display technologies while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of nextgeneration process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet endmarket demand in light of these conditions applied’s results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter 

applied’s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries and growing its services business applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

  



fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 each contained 52 weeks 

fiscal 2018 included a onetime expense related to the enactment of us income tax law that reduced diluted earnings per share by 108 

during fiscal 2020 covid19 was designated a pandemic and the resulting restrictions put in place worldwide impacted applied’s supply chains and manufacturing operations the semiconductor industry was deemed to be part of a us critical infrastructure sector allowing applied to continue operations while ensuring compliance with orders and restrictions imposed by government authorities by putting additional precautionary measures in place to keep its workplaces healthy and safe everywhere applied operates in the world 

even with the unprecedented challenges faced during the pandemic semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions during fiscal 2020 foundry and logic spending increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 led by customer investment in advanced foundrylogic nodes spending by memory customers increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as the market began to recover from excess supply and inventory levels and customers invested in new technology development applied saw continued growth in its services business in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 driven by an increase in the installed base of equipment and in longterm service agreements applied’s display and adjacent markets revenue declined slightly in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to weak demand for display manufacturing equipment for tvs 

in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and evolving conditions and worldwide response applied made adjustments to its global operations and continues to see recovery within its supply chain and strong demand from semiconductor customers however the situation remains fluid and uncertain applied is actively managing its responses in collaboration with its employees customers and suppliers for additional risks associated with the ongoing covid19 pandemic see the risk factor entitled “ the ongoing covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied’s operations and financial results ” in part i item 1a “risk factors” 

results of operations 

net sales 

net sales for the periods indicated were as follows   



net sales in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 increased primarily due to increased customer investments in semiconductor equipment and spending on services net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 decreased primarily due to decreased customer investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment the semiconductor systems segment continued to represent the largest contributor of net sales 

net sales by geographic region determined by the location of customers’ facilities to which products were shipped were as follows 



the changes in net sales in all regions in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflected changes in semiconductor equipment spending the increase in net sales to customers in china taiwan and korea for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increased investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and customer spending on comprehensive service agreements the increase in china was partially offset by a decrease in customer spending in display manufacturing equipment the decrease in net sales to customers in japan and united states for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflected a decrease in investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment the decrease in net sales to customers in southeast asia and europe for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflected a decrease in investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and customer spending on legacy systems and spares 

the changes in net sales in all regions in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily reflected changes in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment spending and customer and product mix the increase in net sales to customers in taiwan and united states for fiscal 2019 compared the prior year was primarily due to increased investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment the decrease in net sales to customers in all other regions for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily reflected a decrease in investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment 

gross margin 

gross margins for the periods indicated were as follows   



gross margin in fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019 year primarily due to the increase in net sales and favorable changes in customer and product mix partially offset by higher freight costs and higher personnel costs due to increase in headcount to provide manufacturing capacity and flexibility underutilization of headcount due to covid19 restrictions preventing travel to customer site and incremental employee compensation related to the covid19 pandemic gross margin in fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the decrease in net sales and unfavorable changes in customer and product mix 

gross margin during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 included 103 million 89 million and 87 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

research development and engineering   

research development and engineering rde expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies 

applied continued its rde investments across semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets on the development of new unit process systems and integrated materials solutions areas of investment include etch deposition inspection patterning packaging and other technologies to improve chip performance power area cost and timetomarket in display and adjacent markets rde investments were focused on expanding the company’s market opportunity with new display technologies 

the increases in rde expenses during fiscal 2020 compared fiscal 2019 were primarily due to additional headcount and higher expense associated with sharebased compensation and variable compensation rde expenses increased slightly in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to additional headcount and increased research and development spending in semiconductor systems and display and adjacent market segments these increases reflect applied’s ongoing investments in product development initiatives consistent with the company’s growth strategy applied continued to prioritize existing rde investments in technical capabilities and critical research and development programs in current and new markets with a focus on semiconductor technologies 

rde expense during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 included 116 million 99 million and 96 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

marketing and selling 

marketing and selling expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



marketing and selling expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 and 2018 marketing and selling expenses for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 included 36 million 31 million and 31 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

general and administrative   

general and administrative ga expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



ga expenses in fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher expense associated with acquisition integration and deal costs variable compensation and sharebased compensation general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2019 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower variable compensation expenses 

ga expenses during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 included 52 million 44 million and 44 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

interest expense and interest and other income loss net 

interest expense and interest and other income loss net for the periods indicated were as follows 



interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes interest expense in fiscal 2020 remained relatively flat compared fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 

interest and other income net primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments realized gains or losses on sales of securities and impairment of strategic investments effective the first quarter of fiscal 2019 unrealized gains and losses on investments classified as equity investments are recognized in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations prior to the adoption of accounting standards update asu 201601 financial instrumentsoverall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 these unrealized gains and temporary losses were included within accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of any related tax effect interest and other income net in fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily driven by lower interest income and a loss on early extinguishment of debt in addition unrealized gains on equity investment securities from investments during fiscal 2020 was lower compared to fiscal 2019 interest and other income net in fiscal 2019 increased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily driven by unrealized gains on equity investment securities 

income taxes 

provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods indicated were as follows 



applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

on june 14 2019 the us government released regulations that significantly affect how the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provision of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act is interpreted as a result applied reversed a tax benefit of 96 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that had been realized in the first half of fiscal 2019 an accounting policy may be selected to treat gilti temporary differences in taxable income either as a currentperiod expense when incurred period cost method or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes deferred method applied has chosen the period cost method 

on march 27 2020 the us government enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act the enactment of the cares act does not result in any material adjustments to applied’s provision for income taxes 

applied’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decline in the tax expense from changes to uncertain tax positions yearoveryear an increased tax benefit from tax credits and increased excess stock compensation tax benefits this benefit was partly offset by an unfavorable settlement of an uncertain tax position in fiscal 2020 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than fiscal 2018 primarily due to tax expense of 11 billion in fiscal 2018 for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act excluding the tax expense of 11 billion the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was higher than fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain provisions in the tax act becoming effective in fiscal 2019 tax expense of 87 million in fiscal 2019 related to changes in uncertain tax positions and the excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation in fiscal 2019 being 42 million less than the prior fiscal year 

segment information 

applied reports financial results in three segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the corporate and other category includes revenues from products as well as costs of products sold for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to its reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level these operating expenses include costs for sharebased compensation certain management finance legal human resource and rde functions provided at the corporate level and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy in addition applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment 

the results for each reportable segment are discussed below 

semiconductor systems segment 

the semiconductor systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for advanced electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive electronics storage and other products and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key technical challenges in transistor interconnect patterning and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes 

semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions during fiscal 2020 foundry and logic spending increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 led by customer investment in advanced foundrylogic nodes spending by memory customers increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as the market began to recover from excess supply and inventory levels and customers invested in new technology development overall semiconductor systems revenue increased in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year

net sales for fiscal 2020 increased in absolute dollars compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher spending from foundry logic and other customers operating margin for fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflecting higher net sales and favorable changes in customer and product mix and lower travel related spending due to covid19 travel restrictions partially offset by increased rde expenses higher freight costs higher personnel costs due to additional headcount to provide manufacturing capacity and flexibility and incremental employee compensation related to the covid19 pandemic 

net sales for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower spending from memory customers partially offset by increased spending from foundry logic and other customers operating margin for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to the prior year primarily reflecting lower net sales unfavorable changes in customer and product mix 

in fiscal 2020 two customers each accounted for more than 10 percent of this segment’s total net sales 

there was no single region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the semiconductor systems segment for any of the past three fiscal years 



applied global services segment 

the applied global services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity including spares upgrades services certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor display and solar products 

demand for applied global services’ service solutions are driven by applied’s large and growing installed base of manufacturing systems and customers’ needs to shorten ramp times improve device performance and yield and optimize factory output and operating costs industry conditions that affect applied global services’ sales of spares and services are primarily characterized by increases in semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts and continued strong utilization rates growth of the installed base of equipment growing service intensity of newer tools and the company’s ability to sell more comprehensive service agreements 

certain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows   



net sales for fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher customer spending on comprehensive service agreements semiconductor spares and legacy systems operating margin for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 decreased primarily due to an increase in headcount to support business growth underutilization of headcount due to covid19 restrictions preventing travel to customer sites higher freight costs and incremental employee compensation related to the covid19 pandemic in fiscal 2020 three customers each accounted for more than 10 percent of this segment’s total net sales 

net sales increased slightly in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher customer spending for comprehensive service agreements and legacy systems partially offset by lower customer spending on semiconductor spares operating income for fiscal 2019 remained flat compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net sales offset by higher expenses related to an increase in headcount operating margin for fiscal 2019 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in headcount to support revenue growth 

there was no single region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years 

display and adjacent markets segment 

the display and adjacent markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal and oled displays and other display technologies for tvs monitors laptops personal computers electronic tablets smart phones and other consumeroriented devices equipment upgrades and flexible coating systems the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologicallydifferentiated equipment for manufacturing largescale lcd tvs oleds low temperature polysilicon ltps metal oxide and touch panel sectors and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields 

display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next generation mobile devices uneven spending patterns by customers in the display and adjacent markets segment can cause significant fluctuations quarteroverquarter as well as yearoveryear 

certain significant measures for the periods presented were as follows   



net sales for fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower customer investments in display manufacturing equipment for tvs partially offset by higher customer investments in display manufacturing equipment for mobile products operating margin for fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019 reflecting favorable changes in customer and product mix and lower travel related spending due to covid19 travel restrictions in fiscal 2020 four customers each accounted for at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales and together they accounted for approximately 74 percent of this segment’s total net sales with one customer accounting for approximately 32 percent of net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower customer investments in mobile and tv display manufacturing equipment operating income and operating margin for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 reflecting lower net sales and unfavorable changes in customer and product mix 

the following region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the display and adjacent markets segment for one or more of the periods presented

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

applied’s cash cash equivalents and investments consist of the following 

  



sources and uses of cash 

a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities is as follows 

  



operating activities 

cash from operating activities for fiscal 2020 was 38 billion which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of noncash charges and changes in working capital components noncash charges included depreciation amortization sharebased compensation and deferred income taxes cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher net income and better cash collections cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 due to lower net income cash collections change in income taxes payable and higher payments to suppliers offset by a decrease in inventories 

applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse applied from time to time also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions the discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements applied sold 12 billion 15 billion and 16 billion of accounts receivable during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively applied discounted letters of credit issued by customers of 105 million 48 million and 37 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively there was no discounting of promissory notes in each of fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018

days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 was 57 days 61 days and 58 days respectively days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms the decrease in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher accounts receivable factoring and favorable revenue linearity compared to the end of fiscal 2019 the increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2019 compared to the end of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower factoring of accounts receivable 

investing activities 

applied used 130 million and 443 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively applied generated 571 million in cash from investing activities in fiscal 2018 capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 were 422 million 441 million and 622 million respectively capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 were primarily for investments in demonstration and testing equipment real property acquisitions and improvements and network equipment capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily for real property acquisitions and improvements in north america and taiwan as well as investments in demonstration testing and laboratory tools proceeds from sales and maturities of investments net of purchase of investments were 399 million 26 million and 12 billion for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies 

applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds us treasury and agency securities municipal bonds corporate bonds and mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities as well as equity securities applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures which may include the sale of certain securities to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies

applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to 16 billion of which 15 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement revolving credit agreement with a group of banks applied entered into the revolving credit agreement in february 2020 which replaced applied’s prior 15 billion revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in september 2021 the revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which applied may request an increase in the amount of the facility of up to 500 million for a total commitment of no more than 20 billion subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such increase and other customary conditions the revolving credit agreement is scheduled to expire in february 2025 unless extended as permitted under the revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars that bear interest for each advance at one of two rates selected by applied plus an applicable margin which varies according to applied’s public debt credit ratings the revolving credit agreement includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance as of october 25 2020 

in march 2020 applied borrowed the full 15 billion available under the revolving credit agreement in order to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the covid19 outbreak in may 2020 applied repaid the full 15 billion of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement applied may at any time and from time to time borrow repay and reborrow under the revolving credit agreement during the term of the facility the interest rate for the march 2020 borrowing under the revolving credit agreement was onemonth libor plus a margin of 0875 based on applied’s public debt credit ratings 

remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately 76 million are with japanese banks applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen 

in august 2019 applied entered into a term loan credit agreement with a group of lenders under the agreement the lenders have committed to make an unsecured term loan to applied of up to 20 billion to finance in part applied’s planned acquisition of all outstanding shares of kokusai electric to pay related transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes the commitments of the lenders to make the term loan will terminate if the transactions contemplated by the share purchase agreement are not consummated on or before december 30 2020 the term loan if advanced will bear interest at one of two rates selected by applied plus an applicable margin which varies according to applied’s public debt credit ratings and must be repaid in full on the third anniversary of the funding date of the term loan 

no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 25 2020 and october 27 2019 

applied has a shortterm commercial paper program under which applied may issue unsecured commercial paper notes of up to a total amount 15 billion as of october 25 2020 applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future the commercial paper program is backstopped by the revolving credit agreement and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement reduce the amount of commercial paper notes applied can issue 

in may 2020 applied issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 1750 senior unsecured notes due 2030 and 750 million aggregate principal amount of 2750 senior unsecured notes due 2050 in a registered public offering in june 2020 applied used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the outstanding 600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2625 senior unsecured notes due october 1 2020 and 750 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4300 senior unsecured notes due june 15 2021 at a total aggregate redemption price of 14 billion as a result applied recognized a 33 million loss on early extinguishment of these senior unsecured notes 

applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of 55 billion outstanding as of october 25 2020 see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional discussion of existing debt applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on applied’s capital requirements and the availability of financing 

others 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax act the tax act requires a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries for fiscal 2018 applied realized tax expense of 11 billion associated with the tax act primarily due to the transition tax the transition tax expense is payable in installments over eight years with eight percent due in each of the first five years starting with fiscal 2018 as of october 25 2020 applied had 857 million of total payments remaining payable in installments in the next six years before the tax act us income tax had not been provided for certain unrepatriated earnings that were considered indefinitely reinvested income tax is now provided for all unrepatriated earnings 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

for details on standby letters of credit guarantee instruments and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries these include agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements as of october 25 2020 the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 233 million applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements 

applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit as of october 25 2020 applied has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately 153 million to cover these arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 25 2020 

  



 

1 represents the transition tax liability associated with the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act into law on december 22 2017 

2 represents applied’s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied’s outstanding purchase orders for goods and services 

3 other longterm liabilities in the table do not include pension postretirement and deferred compensation plans due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants making the timing of payments uncertain information on applied’s pension postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 14 employee benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements 

4 applied’s other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets include deferred income tax liabilities gross unrecognized tax benefits and related gross interest and penalties as of october 25 2020 the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was 485 million interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 25 2020 was 74 million at this time applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services performance obligations are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services applied performs the following five steps to determine when to recognize revenue 1 identification of the contracts with customers 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognition of revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied management uses judgment to identify performance obligations within a contract and to determine whether multiple promised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group judgment is also used in interpreting commercial terms and determining when transfer of control occurs moreover judgment is used to estimate the contract’s transaction price and allocate it to each performance obligation any material changes in the identification of performance obligations determination and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations and determination of when transfer of control occurs to the customer could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a firstin firstout fifo basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 

to test goodwill for impairment applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is concluded that this is the case applied then performs the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required under the twostep goodwill impairment test applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference 

applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain under the income approach applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method 

the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business and considers any significant developments during the period under the discounted cash flow method cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate which considers the longterm earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit’s target capital structure in addition the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied’s current international structure which is consistent with the market participant perspective under the market approach applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publiclytraded companies and considers each reporting unit’s size growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies 

management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets indicators of potential impairment include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment 

income taxes 

applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized 

applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes 

the calculation of applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have an adverse material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted financial results 

management uses nongaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes and as performance measures in its executive compensation program applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of applieds ongoing operating performance 

the nongaap adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions restructuring charges and any associated adjustments certain incremental expenses related to covid19 impairments of assets or investments gain or loss on sale of strategic investments loss on early extinguishment of debt certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments additionally nongaap results exclude estimated discrete income tax expense items associated with us tax legislation reconciliations of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because the nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances applied’s investment portfolio includes fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 17 billion at october 25 2020 these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 25 2020 an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 25 million while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporary at october 25 2020 the aggregate principal of longterm senior unsecured notes issued by applied was 55 billion with an estimated fair values of 66 billion a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied’s longterm debt issuances of approximately 798 million at october 25 2020 

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen israeli shekel euro and taiwanese dollar applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 24 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

applied’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of applied’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer management of applied conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of applied’s internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in “internal control — integrated framework 2013” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on that evaluation applied’s management concluded that applied’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of october 25 2020 

kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k and as part of the audit has issued a report included herein on the effectiveness of applied’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 25 2020 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic applied continues to maintain workplace flexibility such as working remotely where possible to reduce the number of people who are on campus each day business continuity plans are in effect in order to mitigate potential impact on applied’s control environment and its operating and disclosure controls and procedures the design of business continuity plans which include remote access to secure data when needed allow for remote and reliable execution of applied’s operating and disclosure controls and procedures 

applied evaluated the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on its internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect applied’s internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

it should be noted that any system of controls however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met in addition the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events

backlog 

applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order backlog and customer commitments backlog consisted of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 27 2019 and october 28 2018 was as follows 



of the total backlog as of october 27 2019 approximately 12 is not reasonably expected to be filled within the next 12 months 

applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or order cancellations customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

applied’s worldwide manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly integration and test of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries including germany israel italy singapore taiwan the united states and other countries in asia applied uses qualified vendors including contract manufacturers to supply parts services and product support 

although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a qualified single supplier or a limited group of qualified suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for parts monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers maintaining appropriate inventories of parts qualifying new parts on a timely basis and ensuring quality and performance of parts 

research development and engineering 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering rde must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers and ecosystem partners to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements 

applied’s product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in canada china europe india israel singapore and taiwan in addition certain outsourced rde activities process support and customer demonstrations are performed in the united states india china singapore and taiwan 

marketing and sales 

because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells products worldwide almost entirely through a direct sales force 

applied has operations in many countries with some of its business activities concentrated in certain geographic areas and global and regional economic conditions can impact the company’s business and financial results applied’s business is based on capital equipment investments by major semiconductor display and other manufacturers and is subject to significant variability in customer demand for applied’s products customers’ expenditures depend on many factors including general economic conditions anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors display technologies and other electronic devices the development of new technologies customers’ factory utilization capital resources and financing and government policies and incentives in addition a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries has been enddemand for mobile consumer products which has been characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and in turn applied’s business 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements the following companies accounted for at least 10 percent of applied’s net sales in each fiscal year which were for products and services in multiple reportable segments

competition 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to commercialize its technology in a timely manner continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity costeffectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies to global diversified companies applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde marketing and sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

the semiconductor industry is driven by demand for advanced electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive devices storage and other products the growth of data and emerging endmarket drivers such as artificial intelligence augmented and virtual reality the internet of things and smart vehicles are also creating new opportunities for the industry as a result products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions increasingly complex chip architectures new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a variety of technologicallydifferentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements to compete effectively in the marketplace applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry which has experienced increasing consolidation some of these competitors offer a single product line and others offer multiple product lines and range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies 

products and services within the applied global services segment complement semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets segments’ products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to improve tool performance lower overall cost of ownership and increase yields and productivity of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered 

products in the display and adjacent markets segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in asia applied holds established market positions with its technicallydifferentiated lcd and oled manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd pvd array pvd touch panel and tft array testing although its market position could change quickly due to customers’ evolving requirements important factors affecting the competitive position of applied’s display and adjacent markets products include industry trends applied’s ability to innovate and develop new products and the extent to which applied’s products are technicallydifferentiated as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and applied’s existing position at these customers 

patents and licenses 

applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon its research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities as well as its patent position protection of applied’s technology assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that it considers significant applied has approximately 13300 patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of its business in addition to its patents applied possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when it is determined to be in its best interest applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in responding to such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

environmental matters 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventative in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental health or safety incidents including but not limited to spills releases or possible contamination 

compliance with federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

the most recent report on applied’s environmental health and safety activities can be found in applied’s latest corporate social responsibility csr report on its website at httpwwwappliedmaterialscomfiles2018csrpdf the csr report is updated periodically this website address is intended to be an inactive textual reference only none of the information on or accessible through applied’s website is part of this form 10k or is incorporated by reference herein

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

the industries that applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries applied is subject to variable industry conditions since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies enduser demand customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions applied’s industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology these changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on applied’s net sales operating expenses gross margins and net income the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs during periods of decreasing demand applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

applied has product development engineering manufacturing sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas moreover in fiscal 2019 approximately 87 percent of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states as a result of the global nature of its operations applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

• uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands 

• political and social attitudes laws rules regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over nondomestic companies including customer or governmentsupported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors 

• global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses trade sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes 

• customer or governmentsupported efforts to influence applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country such as korea and china 

• variations among and changes in local regional national or international laws and regulations including contract intellectual property cybersecurity data privacy labor tax and importexport laws and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations 

• ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries 

• positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial andor security issues posed by international business operations 

• fluctuating raw material commodity energy and shipping costs 

• delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between countries 

• geographically diverse operations and projects and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes procedures and internal controls and comply with environmental health and safety anticorruption and other regulatory requirements 

• supply chain interruptions and service interruptions from utilities transportation data hosting or telecommunications providers or other events beyond our control 

• failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels languages cultures customs business practices and worker expectations and differing employment practices and labor issues 

• variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers suppliers and governments 

• fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates including the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar against the japanese yen israeli shekel euro taiwanese dollar singapore dollar chinese yuan or korean won 

• the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world 

• performance of third party providers of outsourced functions including certain engineering software development manufacturing information technology and other activities 

• political instability natural disasters pandemics social unrest terrorism or acts of war in locations where applied has operations suppliers or sales or that may influence the value chain of the industries that applied serves 

• challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries 

• the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions and 

• uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries 

international trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could have an adverse impact on our operations 

we sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the united states including china taiwan and korea we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the united states the united states and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods increases in tariffs additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact enduser demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses and our inability to obtain such licenses could potentially limit our markets and impact our business in addition government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies require the license or other transfer of intellectual property or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business many of these challenges are present in china and korea markets that represent a significant portion of applied’s current business as well as longterm growth opportunities 

applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy 

uncertain global economic and business conditions along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions pose challenges to the industries in which applied operates markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services which may have an adverse impact on applied’s revenues results of operations and financial condition uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations if applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings 

applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts which could affect its ability to manage its operations 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated a relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of applied’s business as a result the actions of even a single customer can expose applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer including as a result of changes in government policy have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year and have a significant impact on applied’s net sales gross margins and net income applied’s products are configured to customer specifications and changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition the concentration of applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on applied’s results of operations and cash flow to the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints applied may incur additional bad debt expense which may have a significant impact on its results of operations major customers may also seek pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied which may have a negative impact on applied’s business cash flow revenue and gross margins 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor display and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s products and its consolidated results of operations including 

• the nature timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for applied’s products 

• increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital 

• trade regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants 

• differences in growth rates among the semiconductor display and other industries in which applied operates 

• the increasing importance of establishing improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers 

• the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology 

• the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership 

• the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity device yield and reliability 

• manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and reuse fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment 

• the increasing importance of and difficulties in developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions 

• requirements for shorter cycle times for the development manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment 

• price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays and the corresponding effect on demand for such products 

• the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production 

• the increasing role for and complexity of software in applied products and 

• the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

the largest proportion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor systems segment to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products including 

• the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections and applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes 

• the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors including shrinking geometries the use of new materials new and more complex device structures more applications and process steps increasing chip design costs and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes 

• the need to reduce product development time despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges 

• the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes 

• the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment 

• challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that applied does not serve such as lithography or segments where applied’s products have lower relative market presence 

• the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand 

• semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and reuse equipment and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services 

• shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment which may lead to inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin 

• competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position including challenges in securing developmenttoolofrecord dtor and productiontoolofrecord ptor positions with customers 

• consolidation in the semiconductor industry including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers

applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners in addition new legislation additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges 

applied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals or at all disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions loss of key employees or customers exposure to unanticipated liabilities including among other things those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures and other adverse financial impacts 

applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws 

applied is subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in applicable tax laws interpretations of applicable tax laws amount and composition of pretax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates and valuation of deferred tax assets on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax act on june 14 2019 the us government released regulations that significantly affect how the gilti provision of the tax act is interpreted as a result applied reversed a tax benefit of 96 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that had been realized in the first half of fiscal 2019 an increase in applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

consistent with the international nature of its business applied conducts certain manufacturing supply chain and other operations in asia bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs in certain foreign jurisdictions conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to applied to obtain the benefit of these tax incentives applied must meet requirements relating to various activities applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met or applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions 

in addition applied is subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes which requires estimates and judgments although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates which may be timeconsuming and expensive there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates 

applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business 

applied has 54 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade applied also has in place a 15 billion revolving credit facility and a 20 billion term loan facility to finance in part its planned acquisition of kokusai electric while no amounts were outstanding under either credit agreement as of october 27 2019 applied may borrow amounts in the future under either or both of these agreements applied may also enter into new financing arrangements applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section significant changes in applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings and financial condition if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations or comply with financial and other debt covenants it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied’s obligations there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time 

applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or those developed in collaboration with third parties or obtained through acquisitions applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

• the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for and operate in new markets 

• the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements 

• differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses 

• applied’s ability to anticipate demand capitalize on opportunities and avoid or minimize risks

overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the semiconductor display and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips liquid crystal and organic lightemitting diode oled displays and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components each of applied’s businesses is subject to variable industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips display technologies and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes 

applied operates in three reportable segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in part i item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays spending by semiconductor customers which include companies that operate in the foundry logic and memory markets is driven by demand for advanced electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive devices storage and other products the growth of data and emerging endmarket drivers such as artificial intelligence augmented and virtual reality the internet of things and smart vehicles are also creating new opportunities for the industry as a result products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions increasingly complex chip architectures new materials and an increasing number of applications demand for display manufacturing equipment spending depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for nextgeneration mobile devices and investments in new types of display technologies while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of nextgeneration process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet endmarket demand in light of these conditions applied’s results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter 

applied’s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries and growing its services business applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

  



fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 each contained 52 weeks 

fiscal 2018 included a onetime expense related to the enactment of us income tax law that reduced diluted earnings per share by 108 

customer investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment and services continued to be the primary contributor of revenue during fiscal 2019 semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions spending by memory customers compared to fiscal 2018 was lower as they delayed new capacity additions and lowered their fab utilization rates in response to excess industry supply and inventory levels foundry and logic spending increased yearoveryear led by customer investments in both advanced and mature foundrylogic nodes overall semiconductor systems revenue for fiscal 2019 decreased as compared to the prior year despite the overall wafer fab equipment market being down in 2019 applied saw modest growth in its services business as compared to the prior year this was driven by an increase in the installed base of equipment and continued growth in revenues from longterm service agreements offset by a weaker demand for transactional spares due to lower memory fab utilization applied’s display and adjacent markets revenue declined during fiscal 2019 due to weak demand for display manufacturing equipment for mobile products and tvs

applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies 

applied continued its rde investments across semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets on the development of new unit process systems and integrated materials solutions areas of investment include etch inspection patterning and other technologies to improve chip performance power area and cost in display and adjacent markets rde investments were focused on expanding the company’s market opportunity with new display technologies 

rde expenses increased slightly in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year and increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional headcount and increased research and development spending in semiconductor systems and display and adjacent market segments these increases reflect applied’s ongoing investments in product development initiatives consistent with the company’s growth strategy applied continued to prioritize existing rde investments in technical capabilities and critical research and development programs in current and new markets with a focus on semiconductor technologies 

rde expense during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 included 99 million 96 million and 83 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

marketing and selling 

marketing and selling expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



marketing and selling expenses remained flat in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 marketing and selling expenses increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional headcount 

marketing and selling expenses for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 included 31 million 31 million and 28 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

general and administrative   

general and administrative ga expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2019 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower variable compensation expenses general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional headcount and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuation partially offset by lower variable compensation expense 

ga expenses during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 included 44 million 44 million and 40 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

interest expense and interest and other income loss net 

interest expense and interest and other income loss net for the periods indicated were as follows 



interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes interest expense in fiscal 2019 remained relatively flat compared to the prior year interest expense increased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in march 2017 

interest and other income net primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments realized gains or losses on sales of securities and impairment of strategic investments effective the first quarter of fiscal 2019 unrealized gains and losses on investments classified as equity investments are recognized in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations prior to the adoption of accounting standards update asu 201601 financial instrumentsoverall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 these unrealized gains and temporary losses were included within accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of any related tax effect interest and other income net in fiscal 2019 increased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily driven by unrealized gains on equity investment securities interest and other income net in fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily driven by realized gains on sales of securities and higher interest income from investments 

income taxes 

provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods indicated were as follows 



applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax act the tax act requires a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries payable over eight years us deferred tax assets and liabilities were subject to remeasurement due to the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate the us securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 which provided guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act and a measurement period for companies to complete this accounting applied completed the accounting for the tax act during the measurement period which ended one year after the enactment date of the tax act accounting for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and the accounting for the transition tax was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

the tax act also includes provisions that impact applied starting in fiscal 2019 including a provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti on june 14 2019 the us government released regulations that significantly affect how the gilti provision of the tax act is interpreted as a result applied reversed a tax benefit of 96 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that had been realized in the first half of fiscal 2019 an accounting policy may be selected to treat gilti temporary differences in taxable income either as a currentperiod expense when incurred period cost method or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes deferred method applied has chosen the period cost method 

applied’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than fiscal 2018 primarily due to tax expense of 11 billion in fiscal 2018 for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act excluding the tax expense of 11 billion the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was higher than fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain provisions in the tax act becoming effective in fiscal 2019 tax expense of 87 million in fiscal 2019 related to changes in uncertain tax positions and the excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation in fiscal 2019 being 42 million less than the prior fiscal year 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was higher than fiscal 2017 primarily due to tax expense of 11 billion for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act partially offset by changes in the geographical composition of income tax benefits from the lower us federal corporate tax rate adoption of authoritative guidance for sharebased compensation and the resolution of tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions in addition fiscal 2017 included tax benefits from the recognition of previously unrecognized foreign tax credits 

segment information 

applied reports financial results in three segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the corporate and other category includes revenues from products as well as costs of products sold for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to its reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level these operating expenses include costs for sharebased compensation certain management finance legal human resource and rde functions provided at the corporate level and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy in addition applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment 

the results for each reportable segment are discussed below 

semiconductor systems segment 

the semiconductor systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for advanced electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive devices storage and other products and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key technical challenges in transistor interconnect patterning and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes 

customer investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment continued to be the primary contributor of applied’s revenue during fiscal 2019 semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions spending by memory customers compared to fiscal 2018 was lower as they delayed new capacity additions and lowered their fab utilization rates in response to excess industry supply and inventory levels foundry and logic spending increased yearoveryear led by customer investments in both advanced and mature foundrylogic nodes overall semiconductor systems revenue for fiscal 2019 decreased as compared to the prior year 

certain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows   



  



net sales for semiconductor systems by end use application for the periods indicated were as follows 



net sales for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower spending from memory customers partially offset by increased spending from foundry logic and other customers operating margin for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to the prior year primarily reflecting lower net sales unfavorable changes in customer and product mix five customers each accounted for at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales and together they accounted for approximately 65 percent of this segment’s net sales for fiscal 2019 

net sales for fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher spending from memory customers partially offset by lower spending from foundry logic and other customers although operating margin remained flat operating income for fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to favorable changes in product mix and higher net sales partially offset by higher rde expenses 

the following region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the semiconductor systems segment for one or more of past three fiscal years 



applied global services segment 

the applied global services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity including spares upgrades services certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor display and solar products 

demand for applied global services’ service solutions are driven by applied’s large and growing installed base of manufacturing systems and customers’ needs to shorten ramp times improve device performance and yield and optimize factory output and operating costs industry conditions that affect applied global services’ sales of spares and services are primarily characterized by increases in semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts and continued strong utilization rates growth of the installed base of equipment growing service intensity of newer tools and the company’s ability to sell more comprehensive service agreements 

certain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows   



net sales increased slightly in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher customer spending for comprehensive service agreements and legacy systems partially offset by lower customer spending on semiconductor spares net sales increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher customer spending for spares and services in fiscal 2019 two customers each accounted for at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales 

operating income for fiscal 2019 remained flat compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net sales partially offset by higher expenses related to an increase in headcount operating margin for fiscal 2019 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in headcount to support revenue growth operating income and operating margin for fiscal 2018 increased compared to the fiscal 2017 reflecting higher net sales partially offset by increased headcount to support business growth 

there was no single region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years 

display and adjacent markets segment 

the display and adjacent markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal and oled displays and other display technologies for tvs monitors laptops personal computers electronic tablets smart phones and other consumeroriented devices equipment upgrades and flexible coating systems the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologicallydifferentiated equipment for manufacturing largescale lcd tvs oleds low temperature polysilicon ltps metal oxide and touch panel sectors and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for nextgeneration mobile devices 

the market environment for applieds display and adjacent markets segment in fiscal 2019 was characterized by weak demand for display manufacturing equipment for mobile products and tvs compared to fiscal 2018 in addition uneven demand patterns in the display and adjacent markets segment can cause significant fluctuations quarteroverquarter as well as yearoveryear 

certain significant measures for the periods presented were as follows   



net sales for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower customer investments in mobile and tv display manufacturing equipment operating income and operating margin for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 reflecting lower net sales and unfavorable changes in customer and product mix four customers each accounted for at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales and together they accounted for approximately 68 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2019 

net sales for fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher customer investments in tv display manufacturing equipment operating income and operating margin for fiscal 2018 decreased slightly compared fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher rde spending and unfavorable product mix offset by higher net sales 

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the display and adjacent markets segment for one or more of the periods presented 



recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on applied’s consolidated financial statements see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

applied’s cash cash equivalents and investments consist of the following 

  



sources and uses of cash 

a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities is as follows 

  



in march 2016 the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including forfeitures income tax and classification on the statement of cash flows applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 upon adoption applied elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid for withheld shares retrospectively adopting this guidance increased cash provided by operating activities by 180 million with corresponding net decreases in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2017 

operating activities 

cash from operating activities for fiscal 2019 was 32 billion which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of noncash charges and changes in working capital components noncash charges included depreciation amortization sharebased compensation and deferred income taxes cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 due to lower net income cash collections change in income taxes payable and higher payments to suppliers offset by a decrease in inventories cash provided from operating activities remained flat from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 due to the increase in income taxes payable offset by lower deferred revenue and higher increase in accounts receivable 

applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse applied from time to time also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions the discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements applied sold 15 billion 16 billion and 746 million of accounts receivable during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively applied discounted letters of credit issued by customers of 48 million and 37 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively there was no discounting of promissory notes in each of fiscal 2019 and 2018 applied did not discount letters of credit issued by customers or discount promissory notes during fiscal 2017 

applied’s working capital was 58 billion at october 27 2019 and 67 billion at october 28 2018 

days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 was 61 days 58 days and 54 days respectively days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms the increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2019 compared to the end of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower factoring of accounts receivable the increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2018 compared to the end of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to less favorable revenue linearity in fiscal 2018 

investing activities 

applied used 443 million and 25 billion of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2019 and 2017 respectively applied generated 571 million in cash from investing activities in fiscal 2018 capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 were 441 million 622 million and 345 million respectively capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily for real property acquisitions and improvements in north america and taiwan as well as investments in demonstration testing and laboratory tools capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and laboratory tools in north america proceeds from sales and maturities of investments net of purchase of investments were 26 million and 12 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively purchases of investments net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments was 21 billion for fiscal 2017 investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies 

applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds us treasury and agency securities municipal bonds corporate bonds and mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities as well as equity securities applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures which may include the sale of certain securities to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies 

financing activities 

applied used 31 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2019 consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of 24 billion cash dividends to stockholders of 771 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of 86 million offset by proceeds from common stock issuances of 145 million 

applied used 59 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2018 consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of 53 billion cash dividends to stockholders of 605 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of 164 million offset by proceeds from common stock issuances of 124 million 

applied generated 341 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2017 consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of 22 billion proceeds from common stock issuance of 97 million partially offset by cash used for repurchases of common stock of 12 billion cash dividends to stockholders of 430 million and debt repayments of 205 million 

in september 2017 applied’s board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to 30 billion in repurchases in february 2018 the board of directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing up to an additional 60 billion in repurchases at october 27 2019 19 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program 

during fiscal 2019 applieds board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 020 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of 021 per share during fiscal 2018 applieds board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 010 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of 020 per share during fiscal 2017 applied’s board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of 010 per share applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied’s financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied’s stockholders 

applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to 16 billion of which 15 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in september 2021 this agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of two rates selected by applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 27 2019 remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately 74 million are with japanese banks applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen 

in august 2019 applied entered into a term loan credit agreement with a group of lenders under the agreement the lenders have committed to make an unsecured term loan to applied of up to 20 billion to finance in part applied’s planned acquisition of all outstanding shares of kokusai electric to pay related transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes the commitments of the lenders to make the term loan will terminate if the transactions contemplated by the share purchase agreement spa are not consummated on or before june 30 2020 which date may be extended by three months on two separate occasions if on the applicable date the only remaining conditions to closing relate to required regulatory approvals the term loan if advanced will bear interest at one of two rates selected by applied plus an applicable margin which varies according to applied’s public debt credit ratings and must be repaid in full on the third anniversary of the funding date of the term loan 

no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 27 2019 and october 28 2018 and applied has not utilized these credit facilities 

in fiscal 2011 applied established a shortterm commercial paper program of up to 15 billion at october 27 2019 and october 28 2018 applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future 

in march 2017 applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of 22 billion applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of 54 billion outstanding as of october 27 2019 the indentures governing these notes include covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 27 2019 in may 2017 applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding 200 million in principal amount of senior notes due in october 2017 see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of existing debt applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on applied’s capital requirements and the availability of financing 

others 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act requires a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries for fiscal 2018 applied realized tax expense of 11 billion associated with the tax act primarily due to the transition tax the transition tax expense is payable in installments over eight years with eight percent due in each of the first five years starting with fiscal 2018 as of october 27 2019 applied has 938 million of total payments remaining payable in installments in the next seven years before the tax act us income tax had not been provided for certain unrepatriated earnings that were considered indefinitely reinvested income tax is now provided for all unrepatriated earnings 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries as of october 27 2019 the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 76 million applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements 

applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit as of october 27 2019 applied has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately 151 million to cover these arrangements 

applied also has operating leases for various facilities total rent expense for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 was 51 million 50 million and 34 million respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 27 2019 

  



 

1 represents the transition tax liability associated with the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act into law on december 22 2017 

2 represents applied’s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied’s outstanding purchase orders for goods and services 

3 other longterm liabilities in the table do not include pension postretirement and deferred compensation plans due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants making the timing of payments uncertain information on applied’s pension postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 13 employee benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements 

4 applied’s other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets include deferred income tax liabilities gross unrecognized tax benefits and related gross interest and penalties as of october 27 2019 the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was 489 million interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 27 2019 was 50 million at this time applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services performance obligations are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services applied performs the following five steps to determine when to recognize revenue 1 identification of the contracts with customers 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognition of revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied management uses judgment to identify performance obligations within a contract and to determine whether multiple promised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group judgment is also used in interpreting commercial terms and determining when transfer of control occurs moreover judgment is used to estimate the contract’s transaction price and allocate it to each performance obligation any material changes in the identification of performance obligations determination and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations and determination of when transfer of control occurs to the customer could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 

to test goodwill for impairment applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is concluded that this is the case applied then performs the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required under the twostep goodwill impairment test applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference 

applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain under the income approach applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method 

the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business and considers any significant developments during the period under the discounted cash flow method cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate which considers the longterm earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit’s target capital structure in addition the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied’s current international structure which is consistent with the market participant perspective under the market approach applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publiclytraded companies and considers each reporting unit’s size growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies 

management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets indicators of potential impairment include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment 

income taxes 

applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized 

applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes 

the calculation of applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have an adverse material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted financial results 

management uses nongaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes and as performance measures in its executive compensation program applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of applieds ongoing operating performance 

the nongaap adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions restructuring charges and any associated adjustments impairments of assets or investments gain or loss on sale of strategic investments certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments additionally fiscal 2019 and 2018 nongaap results exclude estimated discrete income tax expense items associated with recent us tax legislation reconciliations of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because the nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

applied operates in three reportable segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

semiconductor systems 

applied’s semiconductor systems segment develops manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips also referred to as integrated circuits ics the semiconductor systems segment includes semiconductor capital equipment used for many steps of the chip making process including the transfer of patterns into device structures transistor and interconnect fabrication metrology inspection and review and packaging technologies for connecting finished ic die applied’s patterning systems and technologies address challenges resulting from shrinking pattern dimensions and the growing complexity in vertical stacking found in today’s most advanced semiconductor devices applied’s transistor and interconnect products and technologies enable continued device scaling of 3d transistors applied’s metrology inspection and review systems’ imaging capabilities and algorithms employ optical and ebeam technologies to meet the most advanced technical demands such as selfaligned double and quad patterning extreme ultraviolet layers measurementintensive optimal proximity correction mask qualification and new 3d architectures applied’s packaging technologies address challenges resulting from the increasing integration of multiple ic dies in a single package applied delivers leadingedge capabilities that enable chipmakers to establish accurate statistical process control ramp up production runs rapidly and achieve consistently high production yields the majority of applied’s new equipment sales are to leading integrated device manufacturers and foundries worldwide 



applied global services 

the applied global services ags segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity including spares upgrades services remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor display and other products customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with 93 locations and trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites in more than a dozen countries to support over 40000 installed applied semiconductor display and other manufacturing systems worldwide applied offers the following general types of services and products under the applied global services segment 



display and adjacent markets 

the display and adjacent markets segment is comprised of products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays lcds organic lightemitting diodes oleds and other display technologies for tvs monitors laptops personal computers pcs electronic tablets smart phones and other consumeroriented devices as well as equipment for processing flexible substrates while similarities exist between the technologies utilized in semiconductor and display fabrication the most significant differences are in the size and composition of the substrate substrates used to manufacture display panels and other devices are typically glass although newer flexible materials are entering the market display and adjacent markets industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and high resolution displays for mobile devices as well as new form factors including thin light and curved displays and new applications such as virtual reality the display and adjacent markets segment offers a variety of technologies and products including 



backlog 

applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order backlog and customer commitments backlog as of october 29 2017 consisted of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 29 2017  was as follows 



in anticipation of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 applied has removed the 12 month threshold in relation to backlog in order to more closely align backlog to performance obligations as defined under the new revenue recognition standard as such backlog as of october 28 2018 consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 28 2018  was as follows 



of the total backlog as of october 28 2018 approximately 15 is not reasonably expected to be filled within the next 12 months 

applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or order cancellations customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly test and integration of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries including germany israel italy singapore taiwan the united states and other countries in asia applied uses numerous vendors including contract manufacturers to supply parts and assembly services for the manufacture and support of its products including some systems being completed at customer sites 

although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts qualifying new parts on a timely basis and ensuring quality and performance of parts 

research development and engineering 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering rde must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers and ecosystem partners to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements 

applied’s product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in canada china europe india israel singapore and taiwan in addition certain outsourced rde activities process support and customer demonstrations are performed in the united states india china singapore and taiwan 

marketing and sales 

because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells products worldwide almost entirely through a direct sales force 

applied has operations in many countries with some of its business activities concentrated in certain geographic areas and global and regional economic conditions can impact the company’s business and financial results applied’s business is based on capital equipment investments by major semiconductor display and other manufacturers and is subject to significant variability in customer demand for applied’s products customers’ expenditures depend on many factors including general economic conditions anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors display technologies and other electronic devices the development of new technologies customers’ factory utilization capital resources and financing and government policies and incentives in addition a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is enddemand for mobile consumer products which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and in turn applied’s business 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements the following companies accounted for at least 10 percent of applied’s net sales in each fiscal year which were for products and services in multiple reportable segments

competition 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to commercialize its technology in a timely manner continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity costeffectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies to global diversified companies applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde marketing and sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

the semiconductor industry is driven by demand for advanced electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive devices storage and other products the growth of data and emerging endmarket drivers such as artificial intelligence augmented and virtual reality the internet of things and smart vehicles are also creating new opportunities for the industry as a result products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions increasingly complex chip architectures new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a variety of technologicallydifferentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements to compete effectively in the marketplace applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry which has experienced increasing consolidation some of these competitors offer a single product line and others offer multiple product lines and range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies 

products and services within the applied global services segment complement semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets segments’ products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to improve tool performance lower overall cost of ownership and increase yields and productivity of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered 

products in the display and adjacent markets segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in asia applied holds established market positions with its technicallydifferentiated lcd and oled manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd pvd array pvd touch panel and tft array testing although its market position could change quickly due to customers’ evolving requirements important factors affecting the competitive position of applied’s display and adjacent markets products include industry trends applied’s ability to innovate and develop new products and the extent to which applied’s products are technicallydifferentiated as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and applied’s existing position at these customers 

patents and licenses 

applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon its research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities as well as its patent position protection of applied’s technology assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that it considers significant applied has approximately 12500 patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of its business in addition to its patents applied possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when it is determined to be in its best interest applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in responding to such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

environmental matters 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventative in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental health or safety incidents including but not limited to spills releases or possible contamination 

compliance with federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

the industries that applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries applied is subject to variable industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies enduser demand customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions applied’s industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology these changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on applied’s net sales operating expenses gross margins and net income the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs during periods of decreasing demand applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy 

uncertain global economic and business conditions along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions pose challenges to the industries in which applied operates markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services which may have an adverse impact on applied’s revenues results of operations and financial condition uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations if applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings 

applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts which could affect its ability to manage its operations 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

applied has product development engineering manufacturing sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas moreover in fiscal 2018  approximately 91 percent  of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states as a result of the global nature of its operations applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 international trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could have an adverse impact on our operations 

we sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the united states and we purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the united states the united states and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods increases in tariffs additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may impact enduser demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses and our inability to obtain such licenses could potentially limit our markets and impact our business in addition government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies require the license or other transfer of intellectual property or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business many of these challenges are present in china and korea markets that represent significant longterm growth opportunities for applied businesses 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor display and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s products and its consolidated results of operations including 

 applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

the largest proportion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor systems segment to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s semiconductor equipment and service products including 



 if applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies and effectively address industry trends its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry 

the global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers the concentrated nature of enduse applications production capacity relative to enduse demand and panel manufacturer profitability industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s display products and services including 

 if applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes 

applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical and its future success depends on many factors including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment services and related products and its ability to increase its position in its current markets expand into adjacent and new markets and optimize operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants have grown more complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits to compete successfully applied must 

 if applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections develop and commercialize new products and technologies and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated a relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of applied’s business as a result the actions of even a single customer can expose applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer including as a result of changes in government policy may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year and have a significant impact on applied’s net sales gross margins and net income applied’s products are configured to customer specifications and changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition the concentration of applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on applied’s results of operations and cash flow to the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints applied may incur additional bad debt expense which may have a significant impact on its results of operations major customers may also seek pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied which may have a negative impact on applied’s business cash flow revenue and gross margins 

applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations acquisitions and strategic investments 

applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied business combinations acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to applied’s business financial condition and operating results including but not limited to 

 applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners in addition new legislation or additional regulations may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges 

applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business 

applied has 54 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade applied also has in place a 15 billion  committed revolving credit agreement while no  amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at october 28 2018  applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement applied may also enter into new financing arrangements applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section significant changes in applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings and financial condition if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations or comply with financial and other debt covenants it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied’s obligations there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time 

applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or those developed in collaboration with third parties or obtained through acquisitions applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied may be subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

manufacturing interruptions or delays or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand lead to higher costs or result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts including components and subassemblies from suppliers including contract manufacturers the inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of parts can have an adverse impact on applied’s manufacturing operations and ability to meet customer demand for equipment spares and services some key parts are subject to long leadtimes or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital technical operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost protection of intellectual property sociallyresponsible business practices or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources which could entail manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties if applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components it could affect its ability to manage its operations and have an adverse impact on applied’s business results of operations and customer relationships in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders applied may incur excess inventory charges 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success

 overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the semiconductor display and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips liquid crystal and organic lightemitting diode oled displays and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components each of applied’s businesses is subject to variable industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips display technologies and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes 

applied operates in three reportable segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in part i item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays spending by semiconductor customers which include companies that operate in the foundry memory and logic markets is driven by demand for advanced electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive devices storage and other products the growth of data and emerging endmarket drivers such as artificial intelligence augmented and virtual reality the internet of things and smart vehicles are also creating new opportunities for the industry as a result products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions increasingly complex chip architectures new materials and an increasing number of applications demand for display manufacturing equipment spending depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for nextgeneration mobile devices and investments in new types of display technologies while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of nextgeneration process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet endmarket demand in light of these conditions applied’s results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter 

applied’s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries and growing its services business applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

  



fiscal 2018 and 2017 contained 52 weeks and fiscal 2016 contained 53 weeks 

fiscal 2018 included a onetime expense related to the enactment of recent us tax legislation that reduced diluted earnings per share by 108 

investment in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment and services continued to be a strong driver of revenue during fiscal 2018 semiconductor equipment customers made investments in new capacity and technology transitions and applied’s overall semiconductor systems revenue increased as compared to the prior year demand for dynamic randomaccess memory dram and nand increased in fiscal 2018 although overall spending by memory customers was lower towards the second half of the year logic customers’ spending remained strong while foundry customers’ spending decreased compared to the prior year and applied continues to see these customers optimize existing capacity and reprioritize their capital spending plans on longer leadtime equipment not in applied’s product portfolio display equipment spending during fiscal 2018 reflected continued investment in new technology and manufacturing equipment for producing larger lcd tvs and in new equipment for mobile devices applied also continued to see strong growth in demand for spares and services from customers as compared to the prior year 

while applied anticipates major technology trends to continue driving longterm growth in the semiconductor industry the trends characterizing the second half of 2018 are likely to continue into early fiscal 2019 with lower spending by memory customers and foundry customers prioritizing spending on longer leadtime equipment not in applied’s product portfolio applied also expects lower spending for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2019 although longterm demand drivers remain in place applied anticipates continued growth in semiconductor spares and services spending in fiscal 2019

gross margins for the periods indicated were as follows 

  

gross margin in fiscal 2018 increased slightly compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net sales and materials cost savings gross margin in fiscal 2017 increased compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher net sales favorable product mix and materials cost savings 

gross margin during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  included 87 million  69 million  and 62 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

research development and engineering   

research development and engineering rde expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies 

in fiscal 2018 applied increased its rde investments across semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets including etch ebeam inspection and other materials engineering solutions to improve chip performance and enable advanced displays applied’s investments in etch were focused on supporting the adoption of precision etch technology for enabling continued scaling of 3d logic and memory chips the investment in ebeam inspection was in support of strengthening our ebeam portfolio which helps achieve higher yields at advanced nodes by detecting the most challenging defects and monitoring and controlling process marginality applied also invested in materials engineering solutions to support patterning applications as well as to improve transistor performance and device power efficiency in display and adjacent markets rde investments were focused on expanding the company’s market opportunity with new display technologies 

rde expenses increased in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to additional headcount and increased research and development spending in semiconductor systems and display and adjacent market segments these increases reflect applied’s ongoing investments in product development initiatives consistent with the company’s growth strategy applied continued to prioritize existing rde investments in technical capabilities and critical research and development programs in current and new markets with a focus on semiconductor technologies 

rde expense during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  included 96 million  83 million  and 76 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

marketing and selling 

marketing and selling expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



marketing and selling expenses increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional headcount marketing and selling expenses increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to additional headcount partially offset by the reduction in bad debt provision recorded during fiscal 2017 

marketing and selling expenses for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  included 31 million  28 million  and 26 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

general and administrative   

general and administrative ga expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional headcount and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuation partially offset by lower variable compensation expense general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 increased compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher variable compensation and additional headcount 

ga expenses during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  included 44 million  40 million  and 37 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

interest expense and interest and other income loss net 

interest expense and interest and other income loss net for the periods indicated were as follows 



interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in june 2011 september 2015 and march 2017 interest expense increased in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in march 2017 

interest and other income net primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments realized gains or losses on sales of securities and impairment of strategic investments interest and other income net in fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily driven by realized gains on sales of securities and higher interest income from investments interest and other income net in fiscal 2017 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher interest income from investments partially offset by higher impairment of strategic investments in fiscal 2017 

income taxes 

provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods indicated were as follows 



applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act includes a reduction to the us federal corporate tax rate from 350 percent to 210 percent and requires a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries payable over eight years us deferred tax assets and liabilities were subject to remeasurement due to the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate applied has a blended us federal corporate tax rate of 234 percent for fiscal 2018 based on the number of days before and after the effective date of the tax act 

the us securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period for companies to complete this accounting pursuant to sab 118 provisional adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could be determined these provisional estimates will be revised as information becomes available and as guidance is issued by the internal revenue service the accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act will be completed during the measurement period which will not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date applied continues to evaluate certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries used to calculate the transition tax the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was higher than fiscal 2017 primarily due to tax expense of 11 billion for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act partially offset by changes in the geographical composition of income tax benefits from the lower us federal corporate tax rate adoption of authoritative guidance for sharebased compensation and the resolution of tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions in addition fiscal 2017 included tax benefits from the recognition of previously unrecognized foreign tax credits 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was lower than fiscal 2016 primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized foreign tax credits and changes in the geographical composition of income in addition fiscal 2016 included unfavorable resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions as well as the reinstatement of the us federal rd tax credit retroactive to its expiration in december of 2015 which did not reoccur in fiscal 2017 

segment information 

applied reports financial results in three segments semiconductor systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the corporate and other category includes revenues from products as well as costs of products sold for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to its reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level these operating expenses include costs for sharebased compensation certain management finance legal human resource and rde functions provided at the corporate level and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy in addition applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment 

the results for each reportable segment are discussed below 

semiconductor systems segment 

the semiconductor systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for advanced electronic products including smartphones and other mobile devices servers personal computers automotive devices storage and other products and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key technical challenges in transistor interconnect patterning and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes 

investment in semiconductor manufacturing equipment continued to be a strong driver of revenue during fiscal 2018 semiconductor equipment customers made investments in new capacity and technology transitions and overall semiconductor systems revenue increased demand for logic dram and nand increased during fiscal 2018 foundry customers’ spending decreased compared to the prior year and applied continues to see these customers optimize existing capacity and reprioritize their capital spending plans on longer leadtime equipment not in applied’s product portfolio 

certain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows   



  

net sales for semiconductor systems by end use application for the periods indicated were as follows 



net sales for fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher spending from memory and logic customers offset by lower spending from foundry customers although operating margin remained flat operating income for fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to favorable changes in product mix and higher net sales partially offset by higher rde expenses six customers represented at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales and together they accounted for approximately 76 percent of this segment’s net sales for fiscal 2018 

net sales for fiscal 2017 increased compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher spending from foundry and memory customers operating income and operating margin for fiscal 2017 increased compared to prior year primarily due to favorable changes in product mix and higher net sales partially offset by higher rde expenses 

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the semiconductor systems segment for one or more of past three fiscal years 



applied global services segment 

the applied global services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity including spares upgrades services certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor display and solar products customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites 

demand for applied global services’ service solutions are driven by applied’s large and growing installed base of manufacturing systems and customers’ needs to shorten ramp times improve device performance and yield and optimize factory output and operating costs industry conditions that affect applied global services’ sales of spares and services are primarily characterized by increases in semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts and continued strong utilization rates growth of the installed base of equipment growing service intensity of newer tools and the company’s ability to sell more comprehensive service agreements 

certain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows   



there was no single region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years 

net sales increased in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher customer spending for spares and services two customers represented at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales and together they accounted for approximately 23 percent of this segment’s net sales for fiscal 2018 

operating income and operating margin for fiscal 2018 increased compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 reflecting higher net sales partially offset by increased headcount to support business growth 

display and adjacent markets segment 

the display and adjacent markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal and oled displays and other display technologies for tvs monitors laptops personal computers electronic tablets smart phones and other consumeroriented devices equipment upgrades and flexible coating systems the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologicallydifferentiated equipment for manufacturing largescale lcd tvs oleds low temperature polysilicon ltps metal oxide and touch panel sectors and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for nextgeneration mobile devices 

the market environment for applieds display and adjacent markets segment in fiscal 2018 was characterized by increased demand for manufacturing equipment for tv and mobile devices uneven demand patterns in the display and adjacent markets segment can cause significant fluctuations quarteroverquarter as well as yearoveryear 

certain significant measures for the periods presented were as follows   



net sales for fiscal 2018 increased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher customer investments in tv display manufacturing equipment operating income and operating margin for fiscal 2018 increased compared fiscal 2017 reflecting higher net sales and favorable product mix partially offset by higher rde spending three customers that represented at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales accounted for approximately 58 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2018 with one customer accounting for approximately 33 percent of net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2017 increased compared to prior year primarily due to higher customer investments in mobile and tv display manufacturing equipment operating income and operating margin for fiscal 2017 increased compared to the prior year reflecting higher net sales and favorable product mix partially offset by increased rde spending 

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the display and adjacent markets segment for one or more of the periods presented 



recent accounting pronouncements

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

applied’s cash cash equivalents and investments consist of the following 

  



sources and uses of cash 

a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities is as follows 

  



 in march 2016 the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including forfeitures income tax and classification on the statement of cash flows applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 upon adoption applied elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid for withheld shares retrospectively adopting this guidance increased cash provided by operating activities by 180 million  and 100 million  with corresponding net decreases in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively see note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this adoption 

operating activities 

cash from operating activities for fiscal 2018  was 38 billion  which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of noncash charges and changes in working capital components noncash charges included depreciation amortization sharebased compensation and deferred income taxes cash provided from operating activities remained flat from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 due to the increase in income taxes payable offset by lower deferred revenue and higher increase in accounts receivable cash provided by operating activities increased from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net income offset by a smaller increase in customer deposits and a greater increase in inventory in fiscal 2017 

applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse applied from time to time also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions the discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements applied sold 16 billion  746 million  and 75 million  of accounts receivable during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively applied discounted letters of credit issued by customers of 37 million  in fiscal 2018 there was no discounting of promissory notes in fiscal 2018 applied did not discount letters of credit issued by customers or discount promissory notes during fiscal 2017 or 2016

applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds us treasury and agency securities municipal bonds corporate bonds and mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities as well as equity securities applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures which may include the sale of certain securities to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies 

financing activities 

applied used 59 billion  of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2018  consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of 53 billion  cash dividends to stockholders of 605 million  and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of 164 million  offset by proceeds from common stock issuances of 124 million  

applied generated 341 million  of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2017  consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of 22 billion  proceeds from common stock issuances of 97 million  partially offset by cash used for repurchases of common stock of 12 billion  cash dividends to stockholders of 430 million  and debt repayments of 205 million  

applied used 35 billion  of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2016  consisting primarily 12 billion  in debt repayments 19 billion  in repurchases of its common stock and 444 million  in cash dividends to stockholders offset by proceeds from common stock issuances of 88 million

during fiscal 2018 applieds board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of 020 per share and one quarterly cash dividend of 010 per share during each of fiscal 2017  and 2016  applied’s board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of 010 per share applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied’s financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied’s stockholders 

applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to 16 billion  of which 15 billion  is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in september 2021  this agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of two rates selected by applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 28 2018  remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately 71 million  are with japanese banks applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen no  amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 28 2018  and october 29 2017  and applied has not utilized these credit facilities 

in fiscal 2011 applied established a shortterm commercial paper program of up to 15 billion at october 28 2018  and october 29 2017  applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future

others 

during 2018 and 2017 applied reduced 1 million  and 17 million  respectively of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applied’s customers applied recorded a bad debt provision of 3 million  in fiscal 2016 while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 28 2018  is adequate it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act requires a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries payable over eight years with eight percent due in each of the first five years starting with fiscal 2018 for fiscal 2018 applied realized tax expense of 11 billion associated with the tax act primarily due to the transition tax the transition tax eliminated the requirement that cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by certain foreign subsidiaries be subject to us income taxes if repatriated for us operations accordingly cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by all foreign subsidiaries may be repatriated for us operation without being subject to further us income taxes 

  although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

offbalance sheet arrangements

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 28 2018  

  



 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements in addition applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units moreover judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 

to test goodwill for impairment applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is concluded that this is the case applied then performs the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required under the twostep goodwill impairment test applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference 

applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain under the income approach applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method 

the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business and considers any significant developments during the period under the discounted cash flow method cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate which considers the longterm earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit’s target capital structure in addition the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied’s current international structure which is consistent with the market participant perspective under the market approach applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publiclytraded companies and considers each reporting unit’s size growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies 

management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets indicators of potential impairment include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations see note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment 

income taxes 

applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized 

applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes 

the calculation of applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have an adverse material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted financial results 

management uses nongaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes and as performance measures in its executive compensation program applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of applieds ongoing operating performance 

the nongaap adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions restructuring charges and any associated adjustments impairments of assets or investments gain or loss on sale of strategic investments certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments additionally fiscal 2018 nongaap results exclude estimated discrete income tax expense items associated with recent us tax legislation reconciliations of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because the nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances applied’s investment portfolio includes fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 20 billion  at october 28 2018  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 28 2018  an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 26 million while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporary at october 28 2018  the aggregate principal and estimated fair values amounts of longterm debt issued by applied were both 54 billion  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied’s longterm debt issuances of approximately 497 million at october 28 2018  

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen euro israeli shekel and taiwanese dollar applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 24 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

risk factors 

tableend the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

the industries that applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries applied is subject to variable industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies enduser demand customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions applied’s industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology these changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on applied’s net sales operating expenses gross margins and net income the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs during periods of decreasing demand applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy 

uncertain global economic and business conditions along with uncertainties in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions pose challenges to the industries in which applied operates markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services which may have an adverse impact on applied’s revenues results of operations and financial condition uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations if applied does not appropriately manage its business operations it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings 

applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts which could affect its ability to manage its operations 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor display and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s products including 

 applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

the largest proportion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor systems segment to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s semiconductor equipment and service products including 



 if applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies and effectively address industry trends its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry 

the global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers the concentrated nature of enduse applications production capacity relative to enduse demand and panel manufacturer profitability industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s display products including 

 if applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes 

applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical and its future success depends on many factors including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment services and related products and its ability to increase its position in its current markets expand into adjacent and new markets and optimize operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants have grown more complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits to compete successfully applied must 

 if applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections develop and commercialize new products and technologies and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated a relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of applied’s business as a result the actions of even a single customer can expose applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year and have a significant impact on applied’s net sales gross margins and net income applied’s products are configured to customer specifications and changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition the concentration of applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on applied’s results of operations and cash flow to the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints applied may incur additional bad debt expense which may have a significant impact on its results of operations major customers may also seek pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied which may have a negative impact on applied’s business revenue and gross margins 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

applied has product development engineering manufacturing sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas moreover in fiscal 2017  approximately 90 percent  of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states as a result of the global nature of its operations applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 many of these challenges are present in china and korea which are experiencing significant growth of customers suppliers and competitors to applied applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions in addition government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies require the license or other transfer of intellectual property or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business 

applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations acquisitions and strategic investments 

applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied business combinations acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to applied’s business financial condition and operating results including but not limited to 

 applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges 

applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business 

applied has 54 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade applied also has in place a 15 billion  committed revolving credit agreement while no  amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at october 29 2017  applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement applied may also enter into new financing arrangements applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section significant changes in applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings and financial condition if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations or comply with financial and other debt covenants it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied’s obligations there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time 

applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or those developed in collaboration with third parties or obtained through acquisitions applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied may be subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

manufacturing interruptions or delays or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand lead to higher costs or result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts including components and subassemblies from suppliers including contract manufacturers the inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of parts can have an adverse impact on applied’s manufacturing operations and ability to meet customer demand for equipment spares and services some key parts are subject to long leadtimes or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital technical operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost protection of intellectual property sociallyresponsible business practices or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources which could entail manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties if applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components it could affect its ability to manage its operations and have an adverse impact on applied’s business results of operations and customer relationships in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders applied may incur excess inventory charges 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

applied’s success competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate employees with key skills and experience achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions management changes applied’s organizational structure increasing global competition for talent the availability of qualified employees cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and the attractiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs the loss or retirement of employees present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions which may result in unexpected costs reduced productivity andor difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls 

applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries if applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable and others may seek counterclaims against applied which could have a negative impact on its business if applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights or if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business in addition changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation such as recent changes in us patent laws may impact applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents and diminish the value of applied’s intellectual property 

third parties may also assert claims against applied and its products claims that applied’s products infringe the rights of others whether or not meritorious can be expensive and timeconsuming to defend and resolve and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel the inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on applied’s business in addition applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential business information any such incidents and claims could severely harm applied’s business and reputation result in significant expenses harm its competitive position and prevent applied from selling certain products all of which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business and results of operations 

  

applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents 

in the conduct of its business applied collects uses transmits and stores data on information technology systems this data includes confidential information belonging to applied or its customers or other business partners as well as personallyidentifiable information of individuals applied has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats none of which have been material to the company to date applied devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse however depending on their nature and scope cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption the misappropriation corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data applied’s and that of third parties reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of applied’s investment in research development and engineering data privacy issues and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs 

applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings 

applied from time to time is and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights antitrust environmental regulations securities contracts product performance product liability unfair competition misappropriation of trade secrets employment workplace safety and other matters applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties 

legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct divert management’s attention and other applied resources inhibit applied’s ability to sell its products result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines and negatively affect applied’s business there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings claims or investigations 

the failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact applied’s business and results of operations 

applied is in the process of implementing new enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations align its global organizations and enable future growth this implementation requires the commitment of significant personnel and financial resources and entails risks to applied’s business operations if applied does not successfully implement new enterprise resource planning and related information systems or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties such as its ability to track orders timely manufacture and ship products project inventory requirements effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources aggregate financial data and report operating results and otherwise effectively manage its business all of which could result in quality issues reputational harm lost market and revenue opportunities and otherwise adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or longlived assets 

applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the review compares the fair value for each of applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value including goodwill factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows declines in the market price of applied common stock changes in applied’s strategies or product portfolio and restructuring activities applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist 

applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws 

applied is subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in 1 applicable tax laws 2 amount and composition of pretax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 3 plans to indefinitely reinvest certain funds held outside of the us and 4 valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities an increase in applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition as of october 29 2017  applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately 45 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries and does not plan to repatriate these funds applied would need to accrue and pay us taxes if these funds were repatriated income tax legislation in the us the “tax cuts and jobs act” could possibly be enacted during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 which could impact applied’s provision for income taxes effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition for example under legislative proposals requiring mandatory repatriation that are being considered applied would need to accrue us taxes on previously unrepatriated earnings 

consistent with the international nature of its business applied conducts certain manufacturing supply chain and other operations in asia bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs in certain foreign jurisdictions conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to applied to obtain the benefit of these tax incentives applied must meet requirements relating to various activities applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met or applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions 

in addition applied is subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes which requires estimates and judgments although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates which may be timeconsuming and expensive there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements in addition applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units moreover judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 

to test goodwill for impairment applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is concluded that this is the case applied then performs the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required under the twostep goodwill impairment test applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference 

applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain under the income approach applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method 

the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business and considers any significant developments during the period under the discounted cash flow method cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate which considers the longterm earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit’s target capital structure in addition the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied’s current international structure which is consistent with the market participant perspective under the market approach applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publiclytraded companies and considers each reporting unit’s size growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies 

management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets indicators of potential impairment include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations see note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment 

income taxes 

applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized 

applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes 

the calculation of applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have an adverse material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted financial results 

management uses nongaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes and as performance measures in its executive compensation program applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of our performance and investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance 

the nongaap adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions restructuring charges and any associated adjustments impairments of assets or investments gain or loss on sale of strategic investments certain other discrete adjustments and income tax items reconciliations of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because the nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances applied’s investment portfolio includes fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 32 billion  at october 29 2017  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 29 2017  an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 24 million while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporary at october 29 2017  the carrying amount of longterm debt issued by applied was 53 billion  with an estimated fair value of 58 billion  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied’s longterm debt issuances of approximately 597 million at october 29 2017  

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen euro israeli shekel and taiwanese dollar applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 24 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

business 

tableend incorporated in 1967 applied is a delaware corporation a global company with a broad set of capabilities in materials engineering applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor display and related industries with its diverse technology capabilities applied delivers products and services that improve device performance yield and cost applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor chips liquid crystal and other displays and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied’s fiscal year ends on the last sunday in october 

as of october 30 2016  applied operates in three reportable segments semiconductor systems previously silicon systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 applied began to account for its flexible coating systems previously included in its energy and environmental solutions segment and display upgrade equipment previously included in its applied global services segment under its display and adjacent markets segment previously display as a result of these changes applied’s solar business previously included in the energy and environmental solutions segment is included in corporate and other as it did not meet the threshold for a separate reportable segment results from prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation 

net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 



semiconductor systems 

applied’s semiconductor systems segment develops manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips also referred to as integrated circuits ics the semiconductor systems segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition etch ion implantation rapid thermal processing chemical mechanical planarization metrology and inspection and wafer packaging the majority of applied’s new equipment sales are to leading integrated device manufacturers and foundries worldwide 

transistor and interconnect 

applied’s transistor and interconnect products and technologies have enabled multiple generations of device scaling from planar transistors to today’s 3d multigate finfet transistors applied offers products and technologies for transistor and interconnect fabrication including epitaxy ion implantation oxidation and nitridation rapid thermal processing chemical vapor deposition physical vapor deposition chemical mechanical planarization and electrochemical deposition many of these process steps are used multiple times throughout the semiconductor chip fabrication process 



patterning and packaging 

applied offers patterning selective removal and packaging products and systems that enable the transfer of patterns onto device structures making it possible to etch masks used for photolithography and perform deposition etching and related processes these systems and technologies address challenges resulting from shrinking pattern dimensions and the complexity in vertical stacking found in today’s most advanced semiconductor devices 



imaging and process control 

applied offers a suite of metrology inspection and review systems for front and backendofline applications these systems’ imaging capabilities and algorithms employ optical and ebeam technologies to meet the most advanced technical demands such as selfaligned double and quad patterning extreme ultraviolet layers measurementintensive optimal proximity correction mask qualification and emerging 3d architectures applied delivers leadingedge capabilities that enable chipmakers to establish accurate statistical process control ramp up production runs rapidly and achieve consistently high production yields 



applied global services 

the applied global services ags segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity including spares upgrades services remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor display and other products customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites in more than a dozen countries and 82 locations to support approximately 34000 installed applied semiconductor display and other manufacturing systems worldwide applied offers the following general types of services and products under the applied global services segment 



display and adjacent markets 

the display and adjacent markets segment is comprised of products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays lcds organic lightemitting diodes oleds and other display technologies for tvs personal computers pcs tablets smart phones and other consumeroriented devices as well as equipment for flexible substrates while similarities exist between the technologies utilized in semiconductor and display fabrication the most significant differences are in the size and composition of the substrate substrates used to manufacture display panels and other devices are typically glass although newer flexible materials are entering the market display and adjacent markets industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and high resolution displays for mobile devices as well as new form factors including thin light and curved displays and new applications such as virtual reality the display and adjacent markets segment offers a variety of technologies and products including 



backlog 

applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order backlog and customer commitments backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 30 2016  and october 25 2015  was as follows 



applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or order cancellations customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly test and integration of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries including germany israel italy singapore taiwan the united states and other countries in asia applied uses numerous vendors including contract manufacturers to supply parts and assembly services for the manufacture and support of its products including some systems being completed at customer sites 

although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts qualifying new parts on a timely basis and ensuring quality and performance of parts 

research development and engineering 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets applied’s significant investments in research development and engineering rde must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements 

applied’s product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in canada china europe india israel singapore and taiwan in addition certain outsourced rde activities process support and customer demonstrations are performed in the united states india china singapore and taiwan 

applied’s investments in rde for product development and engineering programs over the last three fiscal years were as follows 15 billion   14 percent  of net sales in fiscal 2016  15 billion   15 percent  of net sales in fiscal 2015  and 14 billion   16 percent  of net sales in fiscal 2014  applied has spent an average of 15  percent of net sales in rde over the last five years in addition to rde for specific product technologies applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems materials research environmental control and product ideation 

marketing and sales 

net sales by geographic region for the past three fiscal years determined by the location of customers’ facilities to which products were shipped were as follows 



because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells products worldwide almost entirely through a direct sales force 

global and regional economic conditions can impact the company’s business and financial results applied’s business is based on capital equipment investments by major semiconductor display and other manufacturers and is subject to significant variability in customer demand for applied’s products customers’ expenditures depend on many factors including general economic conditions anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors display technologies and other electronic devices the development of new technologies customers’ factory utilization capital resources and financing and government policies and incentives in addition a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is enddemand for mobile consumer products which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and in turn applied’s business 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements the following companies accounted for at least 10 percent of applied’s net sales in each fiscal year which were for products in multiple reportable segments 

  



competition 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity costeffectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies to global diversified companies applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde marketing and sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability particularly mobility devices such as smartphones and tablets the growth of data and new innovations such as augmented and virtual reality and smart vehicles are also creating new opportunities for the industry as a result products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a variety of technologicallydifferentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively in the marketplace applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry which has experienced increasing consolidation some of these competitors offer a single product line and others offer multiple product lines and range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies the competitive environment for semiconductor systems in fiscal 2016 reflected steady overall demand for semiconductor equipment with continued investments by memory customers in technology upgrades and additional capacity reflecting primarily the transition from planar technology to 3d architectures demand from foundry customers reflected investments in new technology at advanced nodes driven by demand for advanced mobile chips 

products and services within the applied global services segment complement semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets segments’ products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to improve tool performance lower overall cost of ownership and increase the productivity and energy efficiency of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered industry conditions that affected applied global services’ sales of spares and services in fiscal 2016 were principally semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts and factory utilization rates 

products in the display and adjacent markets segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in asia applied holds established market positions with its technicallydifferentiated lcd and oled manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd pvd array pvd touch panel and tft array testing although its market position could change quickly due to customers’ evolving requirements the company has also entered a new business in yield control with its new inline ebeam review ebr system the competitive environment for the display and adjacent markets groups in fiscal 2016 was characterized by increasing demand for manufacturing equipment for highend mobile devices and continued demand for tv manufacturing equipment although the tv manufacturing equipment sector remains susceptible to cyclical conditions important factors affecting the competitive position of applied’s display and adjacent markets products include industry trends applied’s ability to innovate and develop new products and the extent to which applied’s products are technicallydifferentiated as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and applied’s existing position at these customers 

patents and licenses 

applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon its research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities as well as its patent position protection of applied’s technology assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that it considers significant applied has approximately 10200 patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of its business in addition to its patents applied possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when it is determined to be in its best interest applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in responding to such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

environmental matters 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventative in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental health or safety incidents including but not limited to spills releases or possible contamination 

compliance with federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

the most recent report on applied’s environmental health and safety activities can be found in applied’s latest citizenship report on its website at httpwwwappliedmaterialscomcompanycorporateresponsibilityreports the citizenship report is updated periodically this website address is intended to be an inactive textual reference only none of the information on or accessible through applied’s website is part of this form 10k or is incorporated by reference herein 

employees 

at october 30 2016  applied employed approximately 15600  regular employees and 1100  temporary employees in the hightechnology industry competition for highlyskilled employees is intense applied believes that its future success is highly dependent upon its continued ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary among its businesses these industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology which depend on several factors including general economic conditions enduser demand customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital consumer buying patterns inventory levels relative to demand and technology transitions these changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on applied’s net sales operating expenses gross margins and net income the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the results of operations of applied’s semiconductor systems segment which is the largest contributor to its consolidated net sales 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs during periods of decreasing demand applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy 

uncertain global economic and business conditions along with uncertainties in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions pose challenges to the industries in which applied operates markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services which may have an adverse impact on applied’s revenues results of operations and financial condition uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations if applied does not appropriately manage its business operations it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings 

applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts which could affect its ability to manage its operations 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor display and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s products including 

 applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

the largest proportion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor systems segment to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s semiconductor equipment and service products including 



 if applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies and effectively address industry trends its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry 

the global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers the concentrated nature of enduse applications production capacity relative to enduse demand and panel manufacturer profitability industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied’s display products including 

 if applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes 

applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical and its future success depends on many factors including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment services and related products in order to successfully grow its businesses applied must increase its position in its current markets expand into adjacent and new markets and optimize operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants have grown more complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits to compete successfully applied must 

 if applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections develop and commercialize new products and technologies and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated a relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of applied’s business as a result the actions of even a single customer can expose applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year and have a significant impact on applied’s net sales gross margins and net income applied’s products are configured to customer specifications and changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition the concentration of applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on applied’s results of operations and cash flow to the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints applied may incur additional bad debt expense which may have a significant impact on its results of operations major customers may also seek pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied which may have a negative impact on applied’s business revenue and gross margins 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

applied has product development engineering manufacturing sales and other operations in many countries and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas moreover in fiscal 2016  approximately 89 percent  of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states as a result of the global nature of its operations applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 



 many of these challenges are present in china and korea which are experiencing significant growth of customers suppliers and competitors to applied applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions in addition government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies require the license or other transfer of intellectual property or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business 

applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations acquisitions and strategic investments 

applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied business combinations acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to applied’s business financial condition and operating results including but not limited to 



 applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges 

applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business 

applied has 34 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade applied also has in place a 15 billion  committed revolving credit agreement while no  amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at october 30 2016  applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement applied may also enter into new financing arrangements applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section significant changes in applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings and financial condition if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations or comply with financial and other debt covenants it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied’s obligations there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time 

applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or those developed in collaboration with third parties or obtained through acquisitions applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 

 in addition applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied may be subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts including components and subassemblies from suppliers including contract manufacturers some key parts are subject to long leadtimes or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing including china and korea variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital technical operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost protection of intellectual property sociallyresponsible business practices or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources which could entail manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties if applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components it could affect its ability to manage its operations and have an adverse impact on applied’s business results of operations and customer relationships in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders applied may incur excess inventory charges 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

applied’s success competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions management changes applied’s organizational structure global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and the effectiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions which may result in unexpected costs reduced productivity andor difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls 

applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries if applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable and others may seek counterclaims against applied which could have a negative impact on its business if applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights or if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business in addition changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation such as recent changes in us patent laws may impact applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents and diminish the value of applied’s intellectual property 

third parties may also assert claims against applied and its products claims that applied’s products infringe the rights of others whether or not meritorious can be expensive and timeconsuming to defend and resolve and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel the inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on applied’s business in addition applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential business information any such incidents and claims could severely harm applied’s business and reputation result in significant expenses harm its competitive position and prevent applied from selling certain products all of which could have a significant adverse impact on applied’s business and results of operations

 overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor display and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips liquid crystal and other displays and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied operates in three reportable segments semiconductor systems previously silicon systems applied global services and display and adjacent markets previously display a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in part i item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products each of applied’s businesses is subject to variable industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips display technologies and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes in addition a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is enddemand for mobile consumer products which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and in turn applied’s business in light of these conditions applied’s results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

  



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented below under “nongaap adjusted results” fiscal 2016 contained 53 weeks and fiscal 2015 and 2014 each contained 52 weeks 

applied’s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries and growing its services business 

mobility and the increasing technological functionality of mobile devices continues to be a strong driver of semiconductor industry spending during fiscal 2016 memory manufacturers invested in technology upgrades and additional capacity both of which were driven primarily by the transition from planar nand to 3d nand foundry customers also invested in technology upgrades and new capacity to meet demand for advanced mobile chips mobility investments including increasing investments in new technology such as oled for mobile devices represents a significant driver of display industry spending which has resulted in higher manufacturing capacity expansion for mobile applications as a result new orders for display equipment increased in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year demand for larger lcd tvs is also a factor for display industry investments although demand for tv manufacturing equipment remains susceptible to cyclical conditions 

in fiscal 2017 applied expects these trends to continue to drive demand for the semiconductor industry and in turn for the semiconductor systems segment applied also expects healthy spending in semiconductor spares and services and increased spending for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2017 

effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 applied began to account for its flexible coating systems previously in energy and environmental solutions and display upgrade equipment previously in applied global services under the display and adjacent markets segment as a result of the change applied’s solar business previously in energy and environmental solutions is included in corporate and other as it did not meet the threshold for a separate reportable segment results for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation 

results of operations 

new orders 

new orders for the periods indicated were as follows 

  

new orders for fiscal 2016 increased across all segments compared to the prior year primarily due to higher demand for display and semiconductor equipment new orders for the semiconductor systems segment continued to comprise the majority of applied’s consolidated total new orders 

new orders for fiscal 2015 slightly increased from fiscal 2014 due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment and semiconductor spares and services partially offset by lower demand for display equipment 

new orders by geographic region for each fiscal year determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer were as follows 



the increase in new orders from customers in taiwan europe and southeast asia in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment and the increase in new orders in china in fiscal 2016 reflected increased demand for semiconductor and display equipment the increase in new orders from customers in korea in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher demand for display equipment the decrease in new orders from customers in japan in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily attributed to lower orders from memory customers partially offset by higher demand for display equipment 

the changes in new orders from customers in korea japan the united states and europe in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected changes in customer mix for semiconductor equipment 

changes in backlog during each fiscal year were as follows 



backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders approximately 64 percent of backlog as of the end of fiscal 2016  is anticipated to be shipped within the next two quarters 

applied’s backlog was 46 billion  at october 30 2016  compared to 31 billion  at october 25 2015  backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2016  and totaled 155 million  primarily due to change in expected timing of shipments order cancellations and other adjustments partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact backlog adjustments were also negative for fiscal 2015 and totaled 220 million  primarily consisting of order cancellations unfavorable foreign currency impacts and other adjustments 

backlog as of the end of the most recent two fiscal years was as follows 

total backlog in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 increased primarily due to higher demand for display and semiconductor equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 approximately 37 percent of net sales in the semiconductor systems segment applied’s largest business segment were for orders received and shipped within the quarter down from 55 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 

net sales 

net sales for the periods indicated were as follows   



net sales in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 increased primarily due to increased customer investments in semiconductor and display equipment the semiconductor systems segment’s relative share of total net sales remained flat compared to the prior year and remains the largest contributor of net sales 

net sales increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to greater customer investments in semiconductor spares and services 200mm equipment systems and display and semiconductor equipment 

net sales by geographic region determined by the location of customers’ facilities to which products were shipped were as follows 



the changes in net sales in all regions for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflected increased spending on semiconductor equipment and changes in customer mix for semiconductor equipment the changes in net sales in korea japan and china also reflected changes in customer mix for display equipment 

the changes in net sales in korea japan and taiwan in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily reflected changes in customer mix for semiconductor equipment the decrease in net sales in the united states was due to lower customer spending on semiconductor equipment partially offset by increased spending on semiconductor spares and services and 200mm equipment

reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented below under “nongaap adjusted results” below 

gross profit nongaap adjusted gross profit gross margin and nongaap adjusted gross margin in fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher net sales partially offset by unfavorable changes in product mix 

gross profit and nongaap adjusted gross profit in fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher net sales while gross margin and nongaap adjusted gross margin decreased primarily due to unfavorable changes in product mix and the absence of a recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2014 

gross profit and nongaap adjusted gross profit during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  included 62 million  57 million  and 53 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

research development and engineering   

research development and engineering rde expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies 

in fiscal 2016 applied increased its rde investments in new product growth across semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets including etch ebeam inspection new materials engineering solutions to improve transistor performance and oled displays applied’s investments in etch were focused on supporting the adoption of the producer® selectra™ etch system an extreme selectivity etch tool for enabling continued scaling of 3d logic and memory chips the investment in ebeam inspection was in support of the provision™ system which helps achieve higher yields at advanced nodes by detecting the most challenging defects and monitoring process marginality applied also invested in materials engineering solutions to improve transistor performance by lowering the contact resistance between the transistor and interconnect wiring in display and adjacent markets rde investments were focused on expanding the company’s market opportunity with a new highresolution inline ebeam review system and forthcoming solutions to improve oled and flexible display manufacturing   

rde expenses increased in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting the impact of ongoing investments in product development initiatives as part of its growth strategy applied continued to reprioritize existing spend to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rde programs in current and new markets with a focus on semiconductor technologies rde expense during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 included 76 million  69 million  and 66 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

marketing and selling 

marketing and selling expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



marketing and selling expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 due to continued cost management efforts marketing and selling expenses for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 included 26 million  26 million  and 23 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

general and administrative   

general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated were as follows 



general and administrative ga expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased compared to the prior year ga expenses were higher in fiscal 2015 primarily due to acquisitionrelated and integration costs related to the terminated business combination with tokyo electron limited tel impact of foreign currency exchange loss as a result of functional currency correction and restructuring charges all recorded during fiscal 2015 

ga expenses for fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower acquisitionrelated and integration costs related to the terminated business combination with tel which was terminated in april 2015 and continued cost management efforts ga expenses during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 included 37 million  35 million  and 35 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

loss gain on derivatives associated with terminated business combination 



changes in gain or loss on derivatives associated with the terminated business combination with tel resulted from exchange rate fluctuations and the sale of derivative contracts in fiscal 2015 for further details see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense and interest and other income loss net 

interest expense and interest and other income loss net for the periods indicated were as follows 



interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in june 2011 and september 2015 interest expense for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in september 2015 

interest and other income net primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments realized gains or losses on sales of securities and impairment of strategic investments interest and other income net in fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher interest income from investments partially offset by a 5 million loss from prepayment of 400 million debt interest and other income net in fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower realized gains on sales of strategic investments in fiscal 2015 

income taxes 

provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods indicated were as follows 



applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

applied’s effective tax rates for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 were 145  138  and 260  respectively the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was higher than fiscal 2015 primarily due to resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions partially offset by changes in the geographical composition of income 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2014 primarily due to acquisition costs that became deductible in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of the termination of the proposed business combination with tel an adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the us related to intercompany sales as discussed below reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 which was retroactive to its expiration in december 2013 resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for prior years and changes in the geographical composition of income 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included the effect of an adjustment primarily to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the us related to intercompany sales while this error had no impact on applied’s consolidated cost of sales it resulted in overstating profitability in the us and the provision for income taxes income taxes payable and other tax balance sheet accounts in each year since fiscal 2010 the impact of the adjustment to fiscal 2015 was a decrease in provision for income taxes of 28 million which was determined to be immaterial on the originating periods and fiscal 2015 accordingly a restatement was not considered necessary

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

applied’s cash cash equivalents and investments consist of the following 

  



sources and uses of cash 

a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities is as follows 

  



operating activities 

cash from operating activities for fiscal 2016 was 25 billion  which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of noncash charges and changes in working capital components noncash charges included depreciation amortization sharebased compensation and deferred income taxes the primary drivers of the increase in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 included higher net income and increases in customer deposits deferred revenue accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by higher increases in accounts receivable the primary drivers of the decrease in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 were the increases in inventories and deferred income taxes and decreases in accounts payable accrued expenses customer deposits deferred revenue and income taxes payable partially offset by higher net income 

applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse applied from time to time also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions the discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements applied sold 75 million  and 45 million  of accounts receivable during fiscal 2016 and 2014 respectively applied did not sell accounts receivable during fiscal 2015 applied did not discount promissory notes or utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers during fiscal 2016 or 2015 applied discounted 29 million  letters of credit issued by customers during fiscal 2014 

applied’s working capital was 47 billion  at october 30 2016  and 55 billion  at october 25 2015  applied’s working capital at october 30 2016  includes the effects of the adoption of the authoritative guidance requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted 

days sales inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated were 



days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms days sales outstanding decreased at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher revenue and sale of accounts receivable and remained flat at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 the decrease in days inventory outstanding during the current year compared to prior year reflected increased business volume offset by higher inventory balances at the end of fiscal 2016 days inventory outstanding increased at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting higher inventory near the end of the period due to increase in deferred inventory and more builds as compared to revenue turns days payable outstanding decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting higher total cost of products sold due to higher business volume and remained relatively flat in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

investing activities 

applied used 425 million  281 million  and 161 million  of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 were 253 million  215 million  and 241 million  respectively capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and laboratory tools in north america capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and infrastructure improvements in north america including creation of a new pilot operation facility and distribution center purchases of investments net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments was 156 million  and 62 million  for fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively proceeds from sales and maturities of investments net of purchases of investments totaled 67 million in fiscal 2014 investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies 

applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds us treasury and agency securities municipal bonds corporate bonds and mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities as well as equity securities applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures which may include the sale of certain securities to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies 

financing activities 

applied used 34 billion  of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2016 consisting primarily of 12 billion in debt repayments 19 billion  in repurchases of its common stock and 444 million  in cash dividends to stockholders offset by excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation of 23 million and proceeds from common stock issuances of 88 million 

applied generated 913 million  of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015 consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of 18 billion and shortterm borrowings of 800 million offset by cash used for repurchases of its common stock of 13 billion  and payment of cash dividends of 487 million  applied used 348 million  of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014 which included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances of common stock applied made no repurchases of its common stock in fiscal 2014 on june 9 2016 applied’s board of directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing up to 20 billion  in repurchases which followed the completion of a 30 billion  common stock repurchase program approved on april 26 2015 at october 30 2016  18 billion  remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program proceeds from stock issuances under equity compensation awards and related excess tax benefits in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 were 111 million  144 million  and 137 million  respectively 

during each of fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 applied’s board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends in the amount of 010 per share applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied’s financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied’s stockholders 

applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to 16 billion  of which 15 billion  is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in september 2020  this agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of two rates selected by applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 30 2016  remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately 77 million  are with japanese banks applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen no  amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 30 2016  and october 25 2015  and applied has not utilized these credit facilities 

in fiscal 2011 applied established a shortterm commercial paper program of up to 15 billion at october 30 2016  and october 25 2015  applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future 

applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of 34 billion outstanding as of october 30 2016  the indentures governing these notes include covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 30 2016  in november 2015 applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding 400 million  in principal amount of senior notes due in 2016 the redemption price was 405 million and after adjusting for the carrying value of the debt issuance costs and discounts applied recorded a 5 million loss on the prepayment of the 400 million debt which is included in nonoperating loss in the consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of existing debt applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on applied’s capital requirements and the availability of financing 

others 

during fiscal 2016 applied recorded a bad debt provision of 3 million and released 9 million  and 16 million  in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applied’s customers while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 30 2016  is adequate it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions 

as of october 30 2016  approximately 40 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to us income taxes if repatriated for us operations applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately 33 billion  of these funds outside of the us and does not plan to repatriate these funds applied would need to accrue and pay us taxes if these funds were repatriated for the remaining cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries us income taxes have been provided for in the financial statements subsequent to october 30 2016  a foreign subsidiary of applied made an advance payment of 18 billion to applied applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate will not be materially affected by this transaction 

  although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

offbalance sheet arrangements

applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit as of october 30 2016  applied materials inc has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately 100 million  to cover these arrangements 

applied also has operating leases for various facilities total rent expense for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 was 38 million  32 million  and 37 million  respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 30 2016  

  



 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements in addition applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units moreover judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 

to test goodwill for impairment applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is concluded that this is the case applied then performs the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required under the twostep goodwill impairment test applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference 

applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain under the income approach applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method 

the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business and considers any significant developments during the period under the discounted cash flow method cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate which considers the longterm earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit’s target capital structure in addition the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied’s current international structure which is consistent with the market participant perspective under the market approach applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publiclytraded companies and considers each reporting unit’s size growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies 

management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets indicators of potential impairment include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment 

income taxes 

applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pretax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings 

applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized 

applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which such change occurs interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied’s provision for income taxes 

the calculation of applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have an adverse material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted financial results 

applied provides investors with certain nongaap adjusted financial measures which are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions restructuring charges and any associated adjustments impairments of assets or investments gain or loss on sale of strategic investments certain other discrete adjustments and income tax items reconciliations of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below 

management uses these nongaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes and as performance measures in its executive compensation program applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of our performance and investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because the nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

backlog by reportable segment as of october 25 2015  and october 26 2014  was as follows 



applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or order cancellations customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly test and integration of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries including germany israel italy singapore taiwan the united states and other countries in asia applied uses numerous vendors including contract manufacturers to supply parts and assembly services for the manufacture and support of its products including some systems being completed at customer sites 

although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts qualifying new parts on a timely basis and ensuring quality and performance of parts 

research development and engineering 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new products including products that enable expansion into new markets applieds significant investments in research development and engineering rde must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during earlystage technology selection applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements 

applied’s product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in in canada china europe india israel singapore and taiwan in addition certain outsourced rde activities process support and customer demonstrations are performed in the united states india china singapore and taiwan 

applieds investments in rde for product development and engineering programs over the last three fiscal years were as follows 15 billion   15 percent  of net sales in fiscal 2015  14 billion   16 percent  of net sales in fiscal 2014  and 13 billion   18 percent  of net sales in fiscal 2013  applied has spent an average of 14  percent of net sales in rde over the last five years in addition to rde for specific product technologies applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems materials research and environmental control that are applicable to its products 

marketing and sales 

net sales by geographic region for the past three fiscal years determined by the location of customers facilities to which products were shipped were as follows 



because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells products worldwide almost entirely through a direct sales force 

general economic conditions can impact the company’s business and financial results applied’s business is based on capital equipment investments by major semiconductor display solar pv and other manufacturers and is subject to cyclical industry conditions customers’ expenditures depend on many factors including anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors display technologies and solar cells and other electronic devices the development of new technologies customers’ factory utilization capital resources and financing government policies and incentives and global and regional economic conditions in addition a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is enddemand for mobile consumer products which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and in turn applied’s business 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements the following companies accounted for at least 10 percent of applied’s net sales in each fiscal year which were for products in multiple reportable segments 

  



competition 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity costeffectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies to global diversified companies applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde marketing and sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability particularly mobility devices such as smartphones and tablets as a result products within the silicon systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a variety of technologicallydifferentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively in the marketplace applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry which has experienced increasing consolidation some of these competitors offer a single product line and others offer multiple product lines and range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies the competitive environment for silicon systems in fiscal 2015 reflected steady demand for semiconductor equipment with increased investment in technology upgrades and additional capacity by memory customers demand from foundry customers reflected investments in new technology at advanced nodes driven by demand for advanced mobile chips 

products and services within the applied global services segment complement silicon systems display and energy and environmental solutions segments’ products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to improve tool performance lower overall cost of ownership and increase the productivity and energy efficiency of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered industry conditions that affected applied global services’ sales of spares and services in fiscal 2015 were principally semiconductor manufacturers wafer starts and factory utilization rates 

products in the display segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in asia applied holds established market positions with its technicallydifferentiated lcd and oled manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd pvd array pvd touch panel and tft array testing although its market position could change quickly due to customers evolving requirements the competitive environment for the display segment in fiscal 2015 was characterized by continued demand for manufacturing equipment for tvs and highend mobile devices although this sector remains susceptible to highly cyclical conditions important factors affecting the competitive position of applieds display products include industry trends applieds ability to innovate and develop new products and the extent to which applieds products are technicallydifferentiated as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and applieds existing position at these customers 

applieds products within the energy and environmental solutions segment compete in several diverse market areas including the csi solar equipment market the solar equipment market has been characterized by significant pressure to reduce customers overall production costs and increase conversion efficiency while endmarket demand for solar pvs has been robust over the last several years investment levels in capital equipment remained low in fiscal 2015 with respect to its csi equipment products applied competes with a number of other companies some of which have significant experience with solar applications and some of which are new entrants to the solar equipment market the solar industry downturn has affected many of applieds competitors and customers adversely with some companies going through extensive financial and organizational restructuring and in some instances ceasing operations 

patents and licenses 

applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon its research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities as well as its patent position protection of applieds technology assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that it considers significant applied has approximately 10200 patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of its business in addition to its patents applied possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when it is determined to be in its best interest applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in responding to such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

environmental matters 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventative in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental health or safety incidents including but not limited to spills releases or possible contamination 

compliance with federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm and they should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

the industries that applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor display and solar industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital enduse demand consumer buying patterns and inventory levels relative to demand as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales operating expenses and net income in particular the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between foundry memory and logic customers can have a significant impact on the results of operations of our silicon systems segment which is the largest contributor to applied’s consolidated net sales and total new orders 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied does not effectively manage its costs during periods of decreasing demand its gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted 

applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy 

uncertain global economic conditions along with uncertainties in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industries in which applied operates the markets for semiconductors and displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services which may in turn reduce applieds net sales reduce backlog and affect applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied’s products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in addition applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor display solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for andor the profitability of applieds products including 

 applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

the largest proportion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the silicon systems segment to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for andor the profitability of applieds semiconductor equipment and service products including 

 15 

 applied must accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections in order to enable opportunities for gains 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry 

the global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers the concentrated nature of enduse applications production capacity relative to enduse demand and panel manufacturer profitability industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and more recently on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for andor the profitability of applieds display products including 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry 

investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility in recent years global solar pv production capacity has exceeded enduse demand causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology or to cease operations recently applied implemented cost reduction measures in its solar business and as a result incurred restructuring charges asset impairments and inventoryrelated charges the global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for andor the profitability of applied’s solar products including 

 applied must continually innovate commercialize its products and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes 

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical its future success depends on many factors including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment services and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including enhancing its presence in existing markets expanding into related markets cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates while constantly improving its operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative geographically diverse open and varied competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely costeffectively and successfully 

 17 

 applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s semiconductor customer base historically has been and is becoming even more highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions in fiscal 2015  two semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 41 percent of the silicon systems segments net sales and two customers accounted for 33 percent of applied’s consolidated net sales applied’s display customer base is also highly concentrated applied’s customer base is also geographicallyconcentrated see item 2 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for tabular presentations of net sales by geographic region 

in addition certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes consolidated with other manufacturers outsourced manufacturing activities or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners also certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments further claims or litigation involving key industry participants have resulted and may continue to result in changes in their sourcing strategies and other outcomes in this environment contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s business the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

in fiscal 2015  approximately 83 percent  of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states moreover china now represents the largest market for various electronic products such as tvs pcs and smartphones certain of applied’s rd and manufacturing facilities as well as suppliers to applied are also located outside the united states including in singapore taiwan china korea israel germany and italy applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries the global nature of applied’s business and operations combined with the need to continually improve the company’s operating cost structure presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

 18 

 many of these challenges are present in china and korea which are experiencing significant growth of customers suppliers and competitors to applied applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions 

applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations acquisitions and strategic investments 

applied has made and in the future may make acquisitions of or investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied business combinations acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks that vary depending on their scale and nature including but not limited to 

 

 applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges 

applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business 

applied has 335 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade applied also has in place a 15 billion  committed revolving credit agreement while no  amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at october 25 2015  applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement applied may also enter into new financing arrangements applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and other risks discussed in this section significant changes in applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings and financial condition if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations or comply with financial and other debt covenants it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied’s obligations there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time 

operating in multiple industries and the entry into new markets and industries entail additional challenges and obligations 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions the entry into different markets involves additional challenges including those arising from 

 20 

 in addition applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied may be subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers including contract manufacturers some key parts are subject to long leadtimes andor obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing including china and korea cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital technical operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain further these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost sociallyresponsible business practices or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources which could entail manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders applied may incur excess inventory charges 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

applied’s success competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees especially in critical positions achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions management changes applied’s organizational structure hiring practices of competitors and other companies cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and the effectiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions which may result in unexpected costs reduced productivity andor difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls 

applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights or obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms furthermore the laws and practices of other countries including china india taiwan and korea permit the protection and enforcement of applied’s rights to varying extents which may not be sufficient to adequately protect applied’s rights in addition changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation such as recent changes in us patent laws may impact applieds ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents and diminish the value of applieds intellectual property 

  

applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents

legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may 1 be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct 2 divert management’s attention and other applied resources 3 inhibit applied’s ability to sell its products 4 result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines andor 5 negatively affect applied’s business there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings claims or investigations 

the failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations 

to better align its costs with market conditions locate closer to customers enhance productivity and improve efficiencies applied conducts certain engineering software development manufacturing sourcing and other operations in regions outside the united states including india taiwan china and korea applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries including germany israel italy singapore taiwan the united states and other countries in asia and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites in addition applied outsources certain functions to third parties including companies in the united states india china korea malaysia and other countries outsourced functions include contract manufacturing engineering customer support software development information technology support finance and administrative activities the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies assure quality and continuity of supply and protect the intellectual property of applied and its customers suppliers and other partners if applied does not accurately forecast the amount timing and mix of demand for products or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer particularly during a market upturn 

in addition applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations including initiatives to enhance its supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing the implementation of new processes and additional functionality to the existing systems entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt applied’s operations such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products project inventory requirements manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data during transitions applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems which may be costly or inefficient while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities or have other unintended consequences 

if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties increased costs including energy and transportation manufacturing interruptions or delays inefficiencies in the structure andor operation of its supply chain loss of its intellectual property rights quality issues reputational harm increased product timetomarket andor inefficient allocation of human resources 

applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or longlived assets 

applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the review compares the fair value for each of applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value including goodwill factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows declines in the market price of applied common stock changes in applied’s strategies or product portfolio and restructuring activities applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist 

changes in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations 

as a global company applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s future provision for income taxes and tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in the 1 applicable tax laws 2 amount and composition of pretax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 3 plans to indefinitely reinvest certain funds held outside of the us and 4 valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

consistent with the international nature of its business applied conducts certain manufacturing supply chain and other operations in asia bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the us will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates to obtain the benefit of these tax incentives applied must meet requirements relating to various activities applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met or applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction 

in addition applied is subject to regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes which requires estimates and judgments although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates which may be timeconsuming and expensive there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals 

applied is subject to risks of noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations 

applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacture and use of its products recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products the operation of its facilities and the use of its real property the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations such as those related to climate change could result in 1 significant remediation liabilities 2 the imposition of fines 3 the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of its products 4 limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property andor 5 a decrease in the value of its real property

 overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor display solar photovoltaic pv and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips liquid crystal and other displays solar pv cells and modules and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in part i item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products each of applied’s businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips display technologies solar pvs and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes in addition a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is enddemand for mobile consumer products which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and in turn applieds business in light of these conditions applieds results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter 

applieds strategic priorities for fiscal 2016 include developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries and growing its services business 

on april 26 2015 applied and tokyo electron limited tel announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate their previously announced business combination agreement which was entered into on september 24 2013 and intended to effect a strategic combination of their respective business into a new combined company no termination fee was payable by either applied or tel 

results of operations 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

  



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 each contained 52 weeks 

mobility and the increasing technological functionality of mobile devices continues to be the largest drivers of semiconductor industry spending fiscal 2015 was characterized by steady demand for semiconductor equipment with increased investment in technology upgrades and additional capacity by memory customers demand from foundry customers reflected investments in new technology at advanced nodes driven by demand for advanced mobile chips mobility represented a significant driver of display industry spending during fiscal 2015 which resulted in continued manufacturing capacity expansion for mobile applications demand for larger tvs was also a factor for display industry investments although demand for tv manufacturing equipment remains susceptible to highly cyclical conditions investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2015 due to ongoing excess manufacturing capacity in the industry gross margin challenges are expected in the first half of fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers and mobility display equipment 

applied expects the mobility trend to remain the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry and in turn for silicon systems in fiscal 2016 demand in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is expected to be driven by foundry and memory spending applied also expects semiconductor spares and services and display equipment investment to remain healthy in fiscal 2016 

during fiscal 2014 demand for advanced mobile chips drove demand for semiconductor equipment by foundry customers in addition demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers improved as manufacturers invested in technology upgrades mobility and demand for larger tvs drove investment in display equipment during fiscal 2014 investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2014 despite continued endmarket growth due to excess manufacturing capacity in the industry 

fiscal 2013 was characterized by strong demand for semiconductor equipment from foundry customers driven by demand for advanced mobile chips in the second half of fiscal 2013 demand from foundry customers softened while demand from memory and logic customers improved display industry spending during fiscal 2013 reflected strong demand for mobile display equipment as well as a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels in fiscal 2012 investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2013 due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the industry 

new orders 

new orders by reportable segment for each fiscal year were as follows 

  

new orders for fiscal 2015 slightly increased from fiscal 2014 due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment and semiconductor spares and services partially offset by lower demand for display and solar equipment new orders for silicon systems and applied global services continued to comprise the majority of applieds consolidated total new orders 

new orders increased in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 across all segments primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment semiconductor spares and services and display equipment 

new orders by geographic region for each fiscal year determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer were as follows 



the changes in new orders from customers in korea japan the united states and europe in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and changes in new orders from customers in the united states japan taiwan and korea for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected changes in customer mix for the silicon systems segment the increase in new orders in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 from china resulted from increased demand from display manufacturing equipment 

changes in backlog during each fiscal year were as follows 



backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders approximately 70 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2015  is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2016 

applied’s backlog was 31 billion  at october 25 2015  compared to 29 billion  at october 26 2014  backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2015  and totaled 220 million  primarily consisting of order cancellations unfavorable foreign currency impacts and other adjustments 

backlog by reportable segment as of the end of each fiscal year was as follows 

total backlog increased in fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in demand from memory customers and for semiconductor spares and services which was partially offset by lower demand for display and solar manufacturing equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 approximately 55 percent of net sales in silicon systems applied’s largest business segment were for orders received and shipped within the quarter up from 44 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 

net sales 

net sales by reportable segment for each fiscal year were as follows   



net sales increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to greater customer investments in semiconductor equipment semiconductor spares and services 200mm equipment systems and display equipment the silicon systems segment remains the largest contributor of net sales 

net sales for all segments increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 the increase primarily reflected increased customer investments in semiconductor and display equipment as well as semiconductor spares and services 

net sales by geographic region for each fiscal year determined by the location of customers facilities to which products were shipped were as follows 



 the changes in net sales from customers in korea japan and taiwan in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily reflected changes in customer mix for semiconductor equipment the decrease in net sales from customers in the united states was due to lower customer spending on semiconductor equipment partially offset by increased spending on semiconductor spares and services and 200mm equipment 

net sales from customers in china increased for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to greater investments in semiconductor display and solar manufacturing equipment while net sales from customers in the united states increased due to higher investments in semiconductor equipment 

gross margin 

gross profit and gross margin for each fiscal year were as follows 

  

reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

gross profit and nongaap adjusted gross profit in fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher net sales while gross margin and nongaap adjusted gross margin decreased primarily due to unfavorable changes in product mix and the absence of a recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2014 

gross profit and gross margin and nongaap adjusted gross profit and nongaap adjusted gross margin increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflecting higher net sales the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013 sales of display and solar tools that had been previously written down lower manufacturing costs and change in product mix gross profit and nongaap adjusted gross profit during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 included 57 million  53 million  and 50 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

research development and engineering   

research development and engineering rde expenses for each fiscal year were as follows 

applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies 

in fiscal 2015 applied increased its investments in new product growth in etch chemical vapor deposition high throughput atomic layer deposition and next generation inspection technology applied’s investments in etch and chemical vapor deposition were focused on supporting the adoption of the etch centris sym 3 product and customer ramps of 3d nand technology applieds investment in atomic layer deposition is yielding products to address customer needs for future nodes and investments in inspection include a new ebeam inspection platform and improved brightfield capabilities 

rde expenses increased in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 reflecting the impact of ongoing product development initiatives as part of its growth strategy applied continued to reprioritize existing spend to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rde programs in current and new markets with a focus on semiconductor technologies rde expense during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 included 69 million  66 million  and 53 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

marketing and selling 

marketing and selling expenses for each fiscal year were as follows 



marketing and selling expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to continued cost management efforts the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was mainly due to headcount reductions marketing and selling expenses during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 included 26 million  23 million  and 20 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

general and administrative   

general and administrative expenses for each fiscal year were as follows 



general and administrative ga expenses for fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower acquisitionrelated and integration costs related to the terminated business combination with tel which was terminated in april 2015 and continued cost management efforts ga expenses for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to integration planning costs associated with the terminated business combination with tel partially offset by proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome ga expenses during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 included 35 million  35 million  and 34 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

loss gain on derivatives associated with terminated business combination 

changes in gain or loss on derivatives associated with the terminated business combination with tel resulted from the sale of derivative contracts and exchange rate fluctuations due to the termination of the proposed business combination the derivatives were sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 for further details see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014 applied performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for all of its reporting units for impairment applied determined that it was more likely than not that each of its reporting units fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units 

during fiscal 2013 the solar industry faced continued deterioration in market conditions associated with manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook resulting in uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures applied performed a twostep goodwill impairment test and as a result recorded 224 million  of goodwill impairment charges in its energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2013 applied also recorded a 54 million  impairment charge related to intangible assets in the energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2013 

the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment in the event of future changes in business conditions applied will reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates a material impairment charge may result at that time 

for further details see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

restructuring and asset impairments 

restructuring and asset impairment expenses for each fiscal year were as follows 



the increase in restructuring and asset impairments net for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the cost reduction measures in the solar business taken during fiscal 2015 to achieve a lower breakeven level and improve business performance the decrease in restructuring and asset impairments net for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was due to completion of the principal activities for the previously announced restructuring plans also in fiscal 2013 applied incurred 2 million  of severance and other employeerelated costs in connection with the integration of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc 

on october 3 2012 applied announced a restructuring plan the 2012 global restructuring plan to realign its global workforce and enhance its ability to invest for growth under this plan applied implemented a voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions that affected approximately 1300  positions as of january 26 2014 principal activities related to this plan were complete during fiscal 2014  and 2013  applied recognized 5 million  and 39 million  respectively of employeerelated costs in connection with the 2012 global restructuring plan total costs incurred in implementing this plan were 150 million  none of which were allocated to the operating segments 

on may 10 2012 applied announced a plan the 2012 ees restructuring plan to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic and lightemitting diode led equipment markets total costs incurred in implementing this plan were 87 million  of which 13 million  were inventoryrelated charges during fiscal 2015 applied recorded a favorable adjustment of 2 million associated with restructuring reserves under this program during fiscal 2013  applied recognized 26 million  of restructuring and asset impairment charges in connection with the 2012 ees restructuring plan these costs were reported in the energy and environmental solutions and applied global services segments

interest expense and interest and other income net 

interest expense and interest and other income net for each fiscal year were as follows 



interest expenses incurred during the past three fiscal years were primarily associated with senior unsecured notes that were issued in june 2011 to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition of varian interest expense for fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014 due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of 18 billion in september 2015 interest expense remained flat during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments and realized gains on sale of securities interest and other income net decreased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower realized gains on sales of strategic investments in fiscal 2015 interest and other income net increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in realized gains on sales of securities recorded during fiscal 2014 partially offset by increased impairments of strategic investments 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for each fiscal year were as follows 



applied’s effective tax rate is affected by the geographical composition of income which includes jurisdictions with income tax incentives and differing tax rates it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period such as changes in income tax laws and regulations and the resolution of income tax filings 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2014 primarily due to acquisition costs that became deductible in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of the termination of the proposed business combination with tel an adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the us related to intercompany sales reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 which was retroactive to its expiration in december 2013 resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for prior years and changes in the geographical composition of income 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2013 due primarily to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2013 offset by resolutions and changes related to prior years and expiration of the us federal research and development tax credit 

segment information 

applied reports financial results in four segments silicon systems applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level these unallocated costs include costs for sharebased compensation certain management finance legal human resource and rde functions provided at the corporate level and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy in addition applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment 

the results for each reportable segment are discussed below 

silicon systems segment 

the silicon systems segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition etch ion implantation rapid thermal processing chemical mechanical planarization metrology and inspection and wafer packaging development efforts are focused on solving customers key technical challenges in transistor patterning interconnect and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes the mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending as it drives device manufacturers to continually improve their ability to deliver highperformance lowpower processors and affordable solidstate storage in a small form factor 

the competitive environment for silicon systems in fiscal 2015 reflected continued investment by semiconductor manufacturers memory manufacturers increased investments in technology upgrades and additional capacity foundry investments reflected demand for new technology as customers ramp wafer starts at advanced nodes to meet demand for advanced mobile chips but decreased primarily due to customers managing excess inventory improving yields and reusing equipment 

certain significant measures for each fiscal year were as follows   



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

the composition of new orders for silicon systems by end use application for the past three fiscal years was as follows 

  

one region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the silicon systems segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years   



customers in taiwan accounted for 32 percent 37 percent and 45 percent of total net sales for silicon systems in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively customers in the united states china and korea together contributed 47 percent 47 percent and 37 percent of the total net sales for this segment in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

financial results in the silicon systems segment for fiscal 2015 reflected continued wafer fabrication equipment spending in the semiconductor industry the increase in new orders and net sales in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily reflected increased demand and spending from memory customers partially offset by lower demand and spending from foundry customers two customers accounted for approximately 41 percent of net sales and three customers accounted for 53 percent of new orders in this segment in fiscal 2015 operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting the increase in net sales partially offset by changes in product mix and higher research and development expenses 

the increase in new orders and net sales in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected increased demand and spending from memory customers as well as continued demand from foundry customers three customers accounted for approximately 54 percent of net sales and three customers accounted for 75 percent of new orders in this segment in fiscal 2014 operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 reflecting the increase in net sales partially offset by changes in product mix and higher research and development expenses 

applied global services segment 

the applied global services segment encompasses integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity including spares upgrades services remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor display and solar products customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites 

industry conditions that affected applied global services sales of spares and services during fiscal 2015 were principally semiconductor manufacturers wafer starts as well as utilization rates 

certain significant measures for each fiscal year were as follows   



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

there were no individual regions that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years 

new orders and net sales for fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014 mainly due to higher demand for semiconductor spares and services and 200mm equipment systems operating income operating margin nongaap adjusted operating income and nongaap adjusted operating margin increased in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014 reflecting the increase in net sales which was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the absence of a recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2014 

new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 mainly due to increased demand for semiconductor spares and services as well as 200mm equipment systems and equipment upgrades operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income increased in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year reflecting the increase in net sales as well as the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013 

display segment 

the display segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays lcds organic lightemitting diodes oleds and other display technologies for tvs personal computers pcs tablets smart phones and other consumeroriented devices the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologicallydifferentiated equipment for manufacturing largescale tvs new markets such as low temperature polysilicon ltps metal oxide and touch panel sectors and development of products that enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced lcd tvs and high resolution displays for next generation mobile devices 

the market environment for applieds display segment in fiscal 2015 has been characterized by continued demand for manufacturing equipment for tv and highend mobile devices although this sector remains susceptible to highly cyclical conditions uneven order and revenue patterns in the display segment can cause significant fluctuations quarteroverquarter as well as yearover year 

certain significant measures for each fiscal year were as follows   



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the display segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years 



in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 customers in china accounted for 75 percent 80 percent and 48 percent respectively of the display segments total net sales customers in korea accounted for 18 percent 16 percent and 32 percent of total net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in net sales from customers in china reflected tv manufacturing capacity expansion while the increase in net sales from customers in korea increasingly related to sales of mobile display manufacturing equipment 

new orders for fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower tv manufacturing equipment orders while net sales for fiscal 2015 were higher due to the timing of shipments operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income increased for fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 reflecting higher net sales operating margin and nongaap adjusted operating margin decreased despite the increase in net sales primarily due to unfavorable product mix increased research and development expenses and the sale of tools in fiscal 2014 for which inventory had been previously fully reserved four customers accounted for approximately 65 percent of new orders for the display segment in fiscal 2015 with two customers accounting for approximately 37 percent of new orders four customers accounted for approximately 79 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2015 with two customers accounting for approximately 46 percent of net sales 

new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 reflecting strong tv manufacturing capacity expansions operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income increased over the prior year due primarily to higher net sales sales of tools for which inventory had been written down previously better installation and warranty performance and material and manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by increased research and development expenses four customers accounted for approximately 87 percent of new orders for the display segment in fiscal 2014 with two customers accounting for approximately 50 percent of new orders four customers accounted for approximately 77 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2014 with one customer accounting for approximately 40 percent of net sales 

energy and environmental solutions segment 

the energy and environmental solutions segment includes products for fabricating crystallinesilicon csi solar pv wafers and cells as well as high throughput rolltoroll deposition equipment for flexible electronics packaging and other applications while enddemand for solar pvs has been robust over the last several years investment in capital equipment has remained low as global pv production capacity exceeds anticipated demand 

certain significant measures for each fiscal year were as follows 



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment for one or more of these recent fiscal periods 

in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 customers in china accounted for 33 percent 62 percent and 58 percent respectively of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment 

financial results during fiscal 2015 remained at low levels due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry which resulted in low levels of new orders and net sales and consequently an operating loss for the segment two customers accounted for approximately 20 percent of net sales for this segment during fiscal 2015 operating loss for fiscal 2015 included 17 million in restructuring charges and asset impairments and 32 million of inventory charges recorded in cost of products sold related to cost reduction measures taken in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 details on restructuring charges and asset impairments are included in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 but remained at low levels reflecting excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry one customer accounted for approximately 23 percent of net sales for this segment during fiscal 2014 operating margin and nongaap adjusted operating margin increased for fiscal 2014 compared to prior year reflecting increased net sales lower inventory charges sales of solar tools that were written down previously and continued cost reduction measures proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome and spending controls

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

applied’s cash cash equivalents and investments increased to 59 billion  at october 25 2015  from 41 billion  at october 26 2014  

cash cash equivalents and investments consisted of the following 

  



sources and uses of cash 

a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities was as follows 

  



operating activities 

cash from operating activities for fiscal 2015 was 12 billion  which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of noncash charges and changes in working capital components noncash charges included depreciation amortization sharebased compensation restructuring and asset impairments and deferred income taxes the primary drivers of the decrease in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 were the increases in inventories and deferred income taxes and decreases in accounts payable accrued expenses customer deposits deferred revenue and income taxes payable partially offset by higher net income the increase in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher business volume and improved working capital performance 

applied did not utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2015 and 2013 applied discounted 29 million of letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2014 discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements applied did not factor accounts receivable nor discounted promissory notes in fiscal 2015 and 2013 applied factored accounts receivable and discounted promissory notes of 45 million  in fiscal 2014 

applied’s working capital was 55 billion  at october 25 2015  and 41 billion  at october 26 2014  

days sales inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated were 



days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and the payment terms days sales outstanding remained flat at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 the decrease for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in revenue and better linearity days inventory outstanding increased at the end of fiscal 2015 reflecting higher inventory near the end of the period due to increase in deferred inventory and more builds as compared to revenue turns days inventory outstanding remained flat in fiscal 2014 and 2013 days payable outstanding remained relatively flat in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 

investing activities 

applied used 281 million  of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2015 and 161 million  in fiscal 2014 applied generated 215 million  in cash from investing activities in fiscal 2013 capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 were 215 million  241 million  and 197 million  respectively capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and laboratory tools in north america capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and infrastructure improvements in north america including creation of a new pilot operation facility and distribution center capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment as well as laboratory tools and equipment upgrades in north america purchases of investments net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments was 62 million  for fiscal 2015 and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments net of purchases of investments totaled 67 million  and 406 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies 

applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds us treasury and agency securities municipal bonds corporate bonds and mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities as well as equity securities applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures which may include the sale of certain securities to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies 

financing activities 

applied generated 913 million  of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015 consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of 18 billion and shortterm borrowings by a whollyowned foreign subsidiary of 800 million offset by cash used for repurchases of its common stock of 13 billion  and payment of cash dividends of 487 million  applied used cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014 and 2013 of 348 million  and 519 million  respectively which included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances of common stock applied made no repurchases of its common stock in fiscal 2014 and used cash to repurchase shares of its common stock in fiscal 2013 of 245 million  on april 26 2015 applieds board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to 30 billion  in repurchases over the three  years ending april 2018 at october 25 2015  17 billion  remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program applieds prior stock repurchase program ended in march 2015 proceeds from stock issuances under equity compensation awards and related excess tax benefits in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 were 144 million  137 million  and 182 million  respectively 

during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014 applied’s board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of 010 per share during fiscal 2013 applied’s board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of 010  per share and one quarterly cash dividend of 009  per share cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2015 2014 and fiscal 2013 amounted to 487 million  485 million  and 456 million  respectively applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied’s financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied’s stockholders 

applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to 16 billion  in september 2015 applied entered into a 15 billion  committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in september 2020  this credit agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of various benchmark rates selected by applied for each advance plus a margin based on applieds public debt rating and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 25 2015  remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately 67 million  are with japanese banks applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen no  amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 25 2015  and october 26 2014  and applied has not utilized these credit facilities 

in fiscal 2011 applied established a shortterm commercial paper program of up to 15 billion at october 25 2015  and october 26 2014  applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future 

in september 2015 applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of 18 billion the indenture governing the notes includes certain covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 25 2015  in november 2015 applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding 400 million  in principal amount of senior notes due in 2016 the redemption price was 405 million and after adjusting for the carrying value of the debt issuance costs and discounts applied recorded a 5 million loss on the prepayment of the 400 million debt which will be included in nonoperating loss in the consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of longterm debt in october 2015 a whollyowned foreign subsidiary of applied entered into a shortterm loan agreement guaranteed by applied under which it borrowed 800 million to facilitate the return of capital to applied 

others 

during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 applied did not record any additional bad debt provision but released 9 million  16 million  and 13 million  respectively of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applieds customers while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 25 2015  is adequate it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions 

as of october 25 2015  approximately 27 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to us taxes if repatriated for us operations of this amount applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately 23 billion  of these funds outside of the us and does not plan to repatriate these funds for the remaining cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries us taxes have been provided for in the financial statements 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

offbalance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements in addition applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units moreover judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 

to test goodwill for impairment applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is concluded that this is the case applied then performs the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required under the twostep goodwill impairment test applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference 

applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain under the income approach applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method 

the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business and considers any significant developments during the period under the discounted cash flow method cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate which considers the longterm earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting units weighted average cost of capital the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting units cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting units target capital structure in addition the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applieds current international structure which is consistent with the market participant perspective under the market approach applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publiclytraded companies and considers each reporting units size growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies 

management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets indicators of potential impairment include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment 

income taxes 

applied’s effective tax rate is affected by the geographical composition of income and income tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryovers deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied’s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowance 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted results 

management uses nongaap adjusted results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes applied believes these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods the nongaap adjusted results presented below exclude the impact of the following where applicable certain items related to acquisitions restructuring charges and any associated adjustments impairments of assets goodwill or investments gain or loss on sale of strategic investments or facilities and certain discrete adjustments and tax items these nongaap adjusted measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from nongaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new products including products that enable expansion into new markets the company’s significant investment in research development and engineering rde has generally enabled it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology selection cycle applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in europe israel taiwan and china in addition applied outsources certain rde activities some of which are performed outside the united states primarily in india and singapore process support and customer demonstration laboratories are located in the united states china taiwan europe and israel 

applied’s investments in rde for product development and engineering programs to create or improve products and technologies over the last three years were as follows 14 billion   16 percent  of net sales in fiscal 2014  13 billion   18 percent  of net sales in fiscal 2013  and 12 billion   14 percent  of net sales in fiscal 2012  applied has spent an average of 13 percent  of net sales in rde over the last five years in addition to rde for specific product technologies applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems materials research and environmental control that are applicable to its products 

marketing and sales 

net sales by geographic region determined by the location of customers facilities to which products were shipped were as follows 

  



because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells products worldwide almost entirely through a direct sales force approximately 78 percent  of applied’s fiscal 2014 net sales were to regions outside of the united states 

general economic conditions impact applied’s business and financial results from time to time the markets in which products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may negatively impact sales applied’s business is cyclical based on capital equipment investment by major semiconductor flat panel display solar pv and other manufacturers customers’ expenditures depend on many factors including anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors display solar cells and modules and other substrates the development of new technologies customers’ factory utilization capital resources and financing government policies and incentives and global and regional economic conditions in addition a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is enddemand for mobile consumer products which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and in turn applieds business 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements the following companies accounted for at least 10 percent of applied’s net sales in fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  which were for products in multiple reportable segments 

  



competition 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity costeffectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies to global diversified companies applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde marketing and sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability particularly mobility devices such as smartphones and tablets as a result products within the silicon systems group segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a variety of technologicallydifferentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively in the marketplace applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry with some offering a single product line and others offering multiple product lines these competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies the competitive environment for the silicon systems group in fiscal 2014 reflected continued investment in the semiconductor industry driven by capacity demand for mobile computing foundry customers led capacity additions for advanced technology nodes and were the primary drivers for net sales of the silicon systems group in fiscal 2014 

products and services within the applied global services segment complement the silicon systems group display and energy and environmental solutions segments’ products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to improve tool performance lower overall cost of ownership and increase the productivity and energy efficiency of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered industry conditions that affected applied global services’ sales of spares and services in fiscal 2014 were principally semiconductor manufacturers wafer starts and factory utilization rates 

products in the display segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in asia applied holds established market positions with its technicallydifferentiated lcd and oled manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd pvd array pvd touch panel and tft array testing although its market position could change quickly due to customers evolving requirements the competitive environment for the display segment in fiscal 2014 was characterized by an increase in demand for tv manufacturing equipment particularly in china and continued demand for equipment to manufacture displays for highend mobile devices demand for larger lcd tvs continues to drive investment in display equipment although the tv manufacturing sector remains susceptible to cyclical conditions important factors affecting the competitive position of applieds display products include industry trends applieds ability to innovate and develop new products and the extent to which applieds products are technicallydifferentiated as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and applieds existing position at these customers 

applieds products within the energy and environmental solutions segment compete in several diverse market areas including the csi solar equipment market the solar equipment market has been characterized by significant pressure to reduce customers overall production costs and improve performance in fiscal 2014 the solar endmarket demand continued to be robust as the industry further reduced manufacturing costs enabling pvgenerated electricity to reach parity with retail electricity rates in an increasing number of areas around the world however investment levels in capital equipment remained low with spending focused on upgrades and improving conversion efficiencies as global solar pv production capacity exceeds enddemand and the rationalization of capacity will be an important factor in determining when supply and demand comes back into balance adding to market uncertainty are international trade actions that have resulted in the imposition of some import sanctions with others still under consideration with respect to its csi equipment products applied competes with a number of other companies some of which have significant experience with solar applications and some of which are new entrants to the solar equipment market the solar industry downturn has affected many of applieds competitors and customers adversely with some companies going through extensive financial and organizational restructuring and in some instances ceasing operations 

patents and licenses 

management believes that applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon the company’s research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has approximately 10500 patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in applied’s best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in responding to such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

environmental matters 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental health or safety incidents including but not limited to spills releases or possible contamination 

compliance with federal state and local environmental health and safety provisions including but not limited to those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm and they should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

the industries that applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor flat panel display and solar industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital enduse demand consumer buying patterns and inventory levels relative to demand as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales operating expenses and net income 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees 

applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy 

uncertain global economic conditions and weak or moderate growth in china europe and the united states along with uncertainties in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industries in which applied operates the markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for pv installations economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services which may in turn reduce applieds net sales reduce backlog and affect applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied’s products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in addition applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for andor the profitability of applieds products including 

 applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

the largest proportion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the silicon systems group to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for andor the profitability of applieds semiconductor equipment and service products including 

 19 

 

applied must accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections such as the transition to 20nm devices in order to enable opportunities for gains in addition the proposed industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers presents opportunities as well as risks and uncertainties including those related to cost technical complexity timing and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment and services 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry 

the global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers the concentrated nature of enduse applications excess production capacity relative to enduse demand and panel manufacturer profitability industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and more recently on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for andor the profitability of applieds display products including 

 20 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry 

investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility in recent years global solar pv production capacity has exceeded enduse demand causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology or to cease operations the global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for andor the profitability of applied’s solar products including 

 applied must continually innovate commercialize its products and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes 

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical its future success depends on many factors including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment services and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including enhancing its presence in existing markets expanding into related markets cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates while constantly improving its operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative geographically diverse open and varied competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely costeffectively and successfully 

 21 

 applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s semiconductor customer base historically has been and is becoming even more highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions in fiscal 2014 three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 54 percent of silicon systems group net sales and two customers accounted for 33 percent of applied’s consolidated net sales applied’s display customer base is also highly concentrated while concentration within applied’s solar customer base varies depending on the product line but is increasing due to challenging industry conditions applied’s customer base is also geographicallyconcentrated see item 2 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for tabular presentations of net sales by geographic region 

in addition certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes consolidated with other manufacturers outsourced manufacturing activities or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners also certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments further claims or litigation involving key industry participants have resulted and may continue to result in changes in their sourcing strategies and other outcomes in this environment contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s business the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

in fiscal 2014 approximately 78 percent  of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states moreover china now represents the largest market for various electronic products such as tvs pcs and smartphones certain of applied’s rd and manufacturing facilities as well as suppliers to applied are also located outside the united states including in singapore taiwan china korea israel germany and italy applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries the global nature of applied’s business and operations combined with the need to continually improve the company’s operating cost structure presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

 22 

 many of these challenges are present in china and korea which are experiencing significant growth of customers suppliers and competitors to applied applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions 

applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations acquisitions and strategic investments 

applied has made and in the future may make acquisitions of or investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied business combinations acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks that vary depending on their scale and nature including but not limited to 

 

 applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges 

the proposed business combination with tokyo electron limited may not be completed or if completed the intended benefits may not be fully realized 

on september 24 2013 applied announced an agreement with tokyo electron limited tel a japanese corporation and global supplier of semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment and provider of technical support and services for semiconductor flat panel display and pv panel production equipment to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses under the agreement which was amended february 14 2014 the closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions including regulatory approvals the proposed business combination is subject to the risk factors described immediately above including the risks that the combination may not be consummated in a timely manner or at all that required regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may be subject to conditions that reduce the estimated benefits of the combination that the businesses operations systems technologies products or employees of applied and tel may not be integrated successfully and following completion of the transaction that ineffective integration changes in laws or regulations including tax laws or other factors may impact the combined company’s ability to realize anticipated synergies and benefits 

operating in multiple industries and the entry into new markets and industries entail additional challenges and obligations 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions the entry into different markets involves additional challenges including those arising from

 • new materials processes and technologies 

 in addition applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied may be subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers including contract manufacturers some key parts are subject to long leadtimes andor obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing including china and korea cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital technical operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain further these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost sociallyresponsible business practices or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources which could entail manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders applied may incur excess inventory charges 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

applied’s success competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees especially in critical positions achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions management changes applied’s organizational structure hiring practices of competitors and other companies cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and the effectiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions which may result in unexpected costs reduced productivity andor difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls 

applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights or obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms furthermore the laws and practices of other countries including china india taiwan and korea permit the protection and enforcement of applied’s rights to varying extents which may not be sufficient to adequately protect applied’s rights in addition changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation such as recent changes in us patent laws may impact applieds ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents and diminish the value of applieds intellectual property 

  

applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents

 overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar photovoltaic pv and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips flat panel liquid crystal and other displays solar pv cells and modules and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in part i item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products each of applied’s businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips display technologies solar pvs and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes in addition a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is enddemand for mobile consumer products which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and in turn applieds business in light of these conditions applieds results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter 

applieds strategic priorities for fiscal 2015 include growing its presence in wafer fab and display equipment and services and improving profitability in solar as well as expanding applieds overall available market 

on september 24 2013 applied announced an agreement with tokyo electron limited tel a japanese corporation and global supplier of semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment and provider of technical support and services for semiconductor flat panel display and pv panel production equipment to effect a combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company the combination is expected to bring together leading technologies and products and create an expanded set of capabilities in precision materials engineering and patterning in june 2014 the shareholders of applied and tel approved the proposed business combination under the agreement which was amended february 14 2014 the closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions including regulatory approvals 

results of operations 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

  



 

reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 each contained 52 weeks 

mobility including the increasing technological functionality of mobile devices continued to be the largest driver of semiconductor industry spending in fiscal 2014 during the year demand for advanced mobile chips drove continued demand for semiconductor equipment by foundry customers in addition demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers improved as manufacturers invested in technology upgrades mobility also represents a significant driver of display industry spending which has resulted in continued manufacturing capacity expansion for mobile applications demand for larger lcd tvs is also driving investment in display equipment although the tv manufacturing sector remains susceptible to cyclical conditions investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2014 despite continued endmarket growth due to ongoing excess manufacturing capacity in the industry 

applied expects the mobility trend to remain the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry and in turn for the silicon systems group in 2015 the growth in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is expected to be driven by foundry and memory spending applied also expects display equipment investment to remain healthy in 2015 

fiscal 2013 was characterized by strong demand for semiconductor equipment from foundry customers driven by demand for advanced mobile chips in the second half of fiscal 2013 demand from foundry customers softened reflecting seasonal consumer buying patterns for mobility products while demand from memory and logic customers improved mobility also represented a significant driver of display industry spending and demand for mobile display equipment remained strong during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2013 was also characterized by a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels in fiscal 2012 resulting from higher consumer demand in emerging markets and for larger lcd tvs investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2013 due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the industry 

fiscal 2012 was characterized by significant fluctuations in demand for semiconductor equipment coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar equipment applied completed its acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 mobility was the greatest influence on semiconductor industry spending in fiscal 2012 investment levels for display equipment were low in fiscal 2012 due to decreased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions while demand for mobility products such as smartphones and tablets significantly influenced equipment spending in the solar industry fiscal 2012 was characterized by excess manufacturing capacity which led to significantly reduced demand for crystallinesilicon csi equipment as well as weak operating performance and outlook 

new orders 

new orders by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



new orders increased in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 across all segments primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment semiconductor spares and services and display equipment new orders for the silicon systems group and applied global services continued to comprise a majority of applieds consolidated total new orders 

new orders for fiscal 2013 increased compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to a recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment and increased demand in semiconductor equipment partially offset by lower demand for service products as well as depressed demand for csi solar equipment due to excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry 

new orders by geographic region determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer were as follows 

  



the changes in new orders from customers in the united states japan taiwan and korea for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected changes in customers mix in the silicon systems group while the increase in new orders from china resulted from increased demand from display manufacturing equipment 

the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2013 led to the increase in new orders from customers in china the change in the composition of new orders from customers in taiwan korea japan and the united states was primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment 

changes in backlog during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were as follows 



backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders approximately 80 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2014 is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2015 

applied’s backlog was 29 billion  at october 26 2014  compared to 24 billion  at october 27 2013  backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2014 and totaled 31 million  consisting of financial debookings foreign exchange and other adjustments 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 26 2014  and october 27 2013  was as follows 

  



backlog increased in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 across all segments the increase in backlog was primarily due to increases in demand for display manufacturing equipment and semiconductor spares and services in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 approximately 44 percent of net sales in the silicon systems group applied’s largest business segment were for orders received and shipped within the quarter down from 49 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

net sales 

net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



net sales for all segments increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 the increase primarily reflected increased customer investments in semiconductor and display equipment as well as semiconductor spares and services the silicon systems group remains the largest contributor of net sales 

for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 net sales in display increased reflecting the recovery of tv manufacturing equipment investment while net sales across all other segments decreased the decrease primarily reflected continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and lower investments in semiconductor equipment spares and services 

net sales by geographic region determined by the location of customers facilities to which products were shipped were as follows 

  



net sales from customers in china increased for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to greater investments in semiconductor display and solar manufacturing equipment while net sales from customers in the united states increased due to higher investments in semiconductor equipment 

the increase in net sales from customers in china in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment the changes in net sales from customers in korea the united states and taiwan were primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment 

gross margin 

gross margins for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

gross margin and nongaap gross margin increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflecting higher net sales the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013 sales of display and solar tools that had been written down previously lower manufacturing costs and change in product mix 

gross margin and nongaap adjusted gross margin decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily reflecting lower sales gross margin percent and nongaap adjusted gross margin percent increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 despite lower sales due primarily to lower inventory charges a favorable product mix and material cost reductions gross margin and nongaap adjusted gross margin during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  included 53 million  50 million  and 54 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

research development and engineering 

research development and engineering rde expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

in fiscal 2014 applied increased its investments primarily in the areas of 3d chip technology and 300mm product development applieds 3d rde investments were focused on products for overcoming the challenges of finfet and 3d nand designs at sub2x nanometer nodes and enabling costeffective manufacturing of these highperformance 3d chips applied also developed new applications for its epitaxial technology to enable the industry’s transition to nmos transistors at the 20nm node thereby enabling chip makers to build faster devices and deliver nextgeneration mobile computing power 

rde expenses increased in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting the impact of ongoing product development initiatives as part of its growth strategy applied has taken certain actions including workforce reductions and reprioritization of existing spend to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rde programs in current and new markets with a focus on semiconductor technologies rde expense during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  included 66 million  53 million  and 54 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

marketing and selling 

marketing and selling expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was mainly due to headcount reductions the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to savings from restructuring programs along with a reduction in the bad debt provision during the year as a result of lower risk exposures among display and solar customers marketing and selling expenses during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  included 23 million  20 million  and 22 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

general and administrative 

general and administrative ga expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



ga expenses for fiscal 2014 increased slightly compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to integration planning costs associated with the announced business combination with tel partially offset by a gain on the sale of foreign exchange option contracts associated with the business combination and proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome the decrease in ga for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the absence of certain costs incurred during fiscal 2012 associated with the acquisition of varian savings from restructuring programs and lower sharebased compensation expense partially offset by costs associated with the proposed business combination with tel ga expenses during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  included 35 million  34 million  and 52 million   respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

impairment of goodwill 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  applied performed an annual qualitative assessment to test goodwill for all of its reporting units for impairment applied determined that it was more likely than not that each of its reporting units fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units 

during fiscal 2013 and 2012 the solar industry faced a deterioration in market conditions associated with manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook resulting in uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures applied performed a twostep goodwill impairment test and as a result recorded 224 million  and 421 million  of goodwill impairment charges in its energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively in fiscal 2013 applied also performed an impairment test for longlived assets associated with the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit and determined that the majority of intangible assets were impaired mostly due to the lower longterm revenue and profitability outlook associated with products related to these intangible assets accordingly during fiscal 2013 applied recorded an impairment charge of 54 million  related to these intangible assets which was the amount by which the carrying value of these intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair value based on discounted projected cash flows 

the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment in the event of future changes in business conditions applied will reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates a material impairment charge may result at that time

restructuring and asset impairments 

restructuring and asset impairment expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



on october 3 2012 applied announced a restructuring plan the 2012 global restructuring plan to realign its global workforce and enhance its ability to invest for growth under this plan applied implemented a voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions that affected approximately 1300  positions as of january 26 2014 principal activities related to this plan were complete during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 applied recognized 5 million  39 million  and 106 million  respectively of employeerelated costs in connection with the 2012 global restructuring plan total costs incurred in implementing this plan were 150 million  none of which were allocated to the operating segments 

on may 10 2012 applied announced a plan the 2012 ees restructuring plan to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic and lightemitting diode led equipment markets as part of the 2012 ees restructuring plan applied relocated certain manufacturing business operations and customer support functions of its precision wafering systems business and ceased led development activities this plan impacted approximately 300  positions globally as of october 27 2013  principal activities related to this plan were complete total costs incurred in implementing this plan were 87 million  of which 13 million  were inventoryrelated charges during fiscal 2013 and 2012 applied recognized 26 million  and 48 million  respectively of restructuring and asset impairment charges in connection with the 2012 ees restructuring plan as of october 26 2014  there were no  remaining severance accruals associated with restructuring reserves under this program 

also in fiscal 2013 and 2012 applied incurred 2 million  and 14 million  respectively of severance and other employeerelated costs in connection with the integration of varian 

for further details see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense and interest and other income net 

interest expense and interest and other income net for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in june 2011 to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition of varian interest expense remained flat during fiscal 2014 from the prior year and in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments and realized gains on sale of securities interest and other income net increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to realized gains on sales of securities recorded during fiscal 2014 partially offset by increased impairments of strategic investments interest and other income net increased in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 primarily due to decreased impairments of strategic investments 

income taxes 

income tax expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2013 due primarily to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2013 offset by resolutions and changes related to prior years and expiration of the us federal research and development tax credit 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was significantly lower than the rate for fiscal 2012 due primarily to the geographic composition of applieds pretax income lower nondeductible goodwill impairment charges and reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit retroactive to its expiration in december 2012 these reductions were partially offset by a lower benefit in fiscal 2013 from the us federal domestic production deduction 

segment information 

applied reports financial results in four segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level these unallocated costs include costs for sharebased compensation certain management finance legal human resource and rde functions provided at the corporate level and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy in addition applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment 

the results for each reportable segment are discussed below 

silicon systems group segment 

the silicon systems group segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition etch ion implantation rapid thermal processing chemical mechanical planarization metrology and inspection and wafer packaging development efforts are focused on solving customers key technical challenges in transistor patterning interconnect and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes the mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending as it drives device manufacturers to continually improve their ability to deliver highperformance lowpower processors and affordable solidstate storage in a small form factor 

with the acquisition of varian applied acquired ion implantation technology for semiconductor as well as csi solar cell manufacturing which was recorded under the silicon systems group segment in fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2013 applied began marketing the solar implant products commercially through its energy and environmental solutions segment accordingly effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 applied accounts for its solar implant products under the energy and environmental solutions segment the effect of the solar implant products was not material to the operations of either the silicon systems group or energy and environmental solutions segments 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

the composition of new orders for the silicon systems group by end use application for the past three fiscal years was as follows 

  

one region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the silicon systems group segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years 

  



customers in taiwan accounted for 37 percent 45 percent and 32 percent of total net sales for the silicon systems group in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively customers in the united states china and korea together contributed 47 percent 37 percent and 54 percent of the total net sales for this segment in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

financial results in the silicon systems group for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 reflected the overall increase in wafer fab equipment spending in the semiconductor industry the increase in new orders and net sales in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected increased demand and spending from memory customers as well as continued demand from foundry customers three customers accounted for approximately 54 percent of net sales and three customers accounted for 75 percent of new orders in this segment in fiscal 2014 operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 reflecting the increase in net sales partially offset by changes in product mix and higher rde spend in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 new orders were 13 billion  a decrease of 15 percent  compared to the prior quarter primarily due to lower orders from memory and foundry customers approximately 44 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were for orders received and shipped within the quarter which increased slightly from 43 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 

the increase in new orders in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily reflected increased demand from memory customers net sales decreased in fiscal 2013 from the prior year due to overall decreased wafer fab equipment spending in the semiconductor industry three customers accounted for approximately 65 percent of new orders and net sales in this segment in fiscal 2013 operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2013 decreased compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting the decrease in net sales changes in product mix and higher rde spend 

applied global services segment 

the applied global services segment encompasses integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity including spares upgrades services remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor display and solar products customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

there were no individual regions that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years 

new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 mainly due to increased demand for semiconductor spares and services as well as 200mm equipment systems and equipment upgrades operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income increased in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year reflecting the increase in net sales as well as the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013 

for fiscal 2013 new orders and net sales decreased compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower demand and investments for semiconductor spares and services the decrease in net sales was also due to lower investments in display upgrades fiscal 2012 net sales also included 85 million in sales for a thin film solar production line operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting lower sales and a 20 million customs duty assessment partially offset by lower operating expenses from spending controls 

display segment 

the display segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays lcds organic lightemitting diodes oleds and other display technologies for tvs personal computers pcs tablets smart phones and other consumeroriented devices the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologicallydifferentiated equipment for manufacturing largescale tvs entry into new markets such as low temperature polysilicon ltps metal oxide and touch panel sectors and development of products that enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced lcd tvs and high resolution displays for next generation mobile devices 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the display segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years 

  



in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 customers in china accounted for 80 percent 48 percent and 28 percent respectively of the display segments total net sales customers in korea and taiwan together accounted for 20 percent of total net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2014 compared to 42 percent in fiscal 2013 and 57 percent in fiscal 2012 the increase in net sales from customers in china reflected tv manufacturing capacity expansion while the decrease in net sales from customers in korea and taiwan primarily related to lower sales of mobile display manufacturing equipment 

new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to the prior year reflecting strong tv manufacturing capacity expansions operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income increased over the prior year due primarily to higher net sales sales of tools for which inventory had been written down previously better installation and warranty performance and material and manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by increased research and development expenses four customers accounted for approximately 87 percent of new orders for the display segment in fiscal 2014 with two customers accounting for approximately 50 percent of new orders four customers accounted for approximately 77 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2014 with one customer accounting for approximately 40 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 new orders were 130 million  down 56 percent  from the prior quarter primarily reflecting continued variability in industry order patterns net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were 190 million  up 60 percent  compared to the prior quarter as a result of shipment of tv manufacturing equipment to customers in china 

fiscal 2013 operating results reflected a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment and continued demand for advanced mobile display equipment which resulted in increased new orders net sales operating income and nongaap adjusted operating income compared to fiscal 2012 two customers accounted for approximately 50 percent of net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2013 

energy and environmental solutions segment 

the energy and environmental solutions segment includes products for fabricating crystallinesilicon csi solar pv wafers and cells as well as high throughput rolltoroll deposition equipment for flexible electronics packaging and other applications this business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy with an emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar modules and increasing conversion efficiency while enddemand for solar pvs has been robust over the last several years investment in capital equipment remained low as global pv production capacity exceeds anticipated demand the solar equipment environment improved slightly in fiscal 2014 compared to the previous year 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

the following region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years 

  



in fiscal 2014 customers in china accounted for 62 percent of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment compared to 58 percent in fiscal 2013 and 49 percent in fiscal 2012 

new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 but remained at low levels due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry one customer accounted for approximately 23 percent of net sales for this segment during fiscal 2014 operating margin and nongaap adjusted operating margin increased for fiscal 2014 compared to prior year reflecting increased net sales lower inventory charges sales of solar tools that were written down previously and continued cost reduction measures proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome and spending controls in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 new orders were 44 million  down from 66 million  in the prior quarter and net sales were 48 million  down 53 percent  from the prior quarter 

fiscal 2013 financial results continued to reflect excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry which resulted in low levels of new orders and net sales and consequently an operating loss for the segment operating loss for fiscal 2013 included 278 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges as well as restructuring and asset impairment charges of 25 million associated with the 2012 ees restructuring plan discussed above details on goodwill and intangible asset impairment and restructuring and asset impairment charges are also included in note 9 and note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the indenture governing the notes includes certain covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 26 2014  see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of longterm debt 

others 

during fiscal 2014 and 2013 applied did not record any additional bad debt provision but released 16 million  and 13 million  respectively of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applieds customers while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 26 2014  is adequate it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions 

as of october 26 2014  approximately 27 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to us taxes if repatriated for us operations of this amount applied intends to permanently reinvest approximately 21 billion  of these funds outside of the us and does not plan to repatriate these funds for the remaining cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries us taxes have been provided for in the financial statements 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries as of october 26 2014  the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 46 million  applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements 

applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit as of october 26 2014  applied materials inc has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately 102 million  to cover these arrangements

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 26 2014  

  



 

 in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above applied has certain tax obligations gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of october 26 2014  the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 134 million  increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were 25 million  as of october 26 2014  and 7 million  as of october 27 2013  and were classified as a noncurrent liability in the consolidated balance sheets at this time applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and accordingly such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements in addition applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units moreover judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets a severe decline in market conditions could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective tax rate as required if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryovers deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied’s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowance 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted results 

management uses nongaap adjusted results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes applied believes these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods the nongaap adjusted results presented below exclude the impact of the following where applicable certain items related to acquisitions or the announced business combination restructuring charges and any associated adjustments impairments of assets goodwill or investments gain or loss on sale of strategic investments or facilities and certain tax items these nongaap adjusted measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from nongaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances applied’s investment portfolio includes fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 10 billion  at october 26 2014  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 26 2014  an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 16 million while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporary at october 26 2014  the carrying amount of debt issued by applied was 19 billion  with an estimated fair value of 22 billion  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied’s debt issuances of approximately 180 million at october 26 2014  

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen euro israeli shekel taiwanese dollar and swiss franc applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 24 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

in certain cases applied uses derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures during fiscal 2014 and 2013 as part of an overall risk management strategy applied purchased foreign exchange option contracts to limit its foreign exchange risk associated with the announced business combination with tel in the event there is a significant weakening in the japanese yen as compared to the us dollar the derivatives used to hedge the currency exposure did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment at october 26 2014 the fair value of the foreign exchange currency option contracts was approximately 52 million  applied recorded an unrealized loss of 12 million  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 related to such contracts changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen would impact applieds consolidated financial statements the future maximum loss exposure on this option contract is generally limited to its fair value as of the most recent balance sheet date for further details see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements

business 

tableend incorporated in 1967 applied a delaware corporation provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar photovoltaic pv and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips flat panel liquid crystal and other displays solar pv cells and modules and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied’s fiscal year ends on the last sunday in october 

applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions applied manages its business based upon these segments a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

in november 2011 applied completed the acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian a leading supplier of ion implantation equipment to the semiconductor and solar industries the acquisition expanded applieds technologies for chip and solar module manufacturing the acquired business is primarily included in consolidated results of operations and the results of the silicon systems group and applied global services segments 

net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



silicon systems group segment 

the silicon systems group segment develops manufactures and sells manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips also referred to as integrated circuits ics most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components such as transistors and other devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring interconnects applied offers systems that perform various processes used in chip fabrication including atomic layer deposition ald chemical vapor deposition cvd physical vapor deposition pvd electrochemical deposition ecd rapid thermal processing rtp ion implantation chemical mechanical planarization cmp wet cleaning and wafer metrology and inspection as well as systems that etch or inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build and package memory logic and other types of chips 

the majority of the companys new equipment sales are for leadingedge technology for advanced nodes using 28 nanometer nm and smaller dimensions to build a chip the transistors capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove portions of successive film layers similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer as the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing capability in the same or smaller physical area the complexity of building the chip also increases necessitating more process steps to form smaller transistor structures and more intricate wiring schemes advanced chip designs require more than 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle

 competition 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity and costeffectiveness the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies to global diversified companies applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde marketing and sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability as a result products within the silicon systems group segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a variety of technologically differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry with some offering a single product line and others offering multiple product lines these competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies the competitive environment for the silicon systems group in fiscal 2013 reflected continued investment in the semiconductor industry driven by capacity demand for mobile computing foundry customers led capacity additions for advanced technology nodes and were the primary drivers for net sales of the silicon systems group in fiscal 2013 

products and services within the applied global services segment complement the silicon systems group display and energy and environmental solutions segments’ products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to improve tool performance lower overall cost of ownership and increase the productivity and energy efficiency of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered industry conditions that affected applied global services’ sales of spares and services in fiscal 2013 were principally semiconductor manufacturers wafer starts and factory utilization rates 

products in the display segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in asia applied holds established market positions with its technicallydifferentiated lcd and oled manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd pvd array pvd touch panel and tft array testing although its market position could change quickly due to customers evolving requirements the competitive environment for the display segment in fiscal 2013 was characterized by a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels the prior year while demand continued for equipment to make touch screen and highend mobile devices important factors affecting the competitive position of applieds display products include industry trends applieds ability to innovate and develop new products and the extent to which applieds products are technicallydifferentiated as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and applieds existing position at these customers 

applieds products within the energy and environmental solutions segment compete in several diverse market areas including primarily the csi solar equipment market the solar equipment market is characterized by significant pressure to reduce customers overall production costs and improve performance in fiscal 2013 while solar endmarket demand continued to be robust as the industry further reduced manufacturing costs and made conversion efficiency improvements enabling pvgenerated electricity to reach parity with retail electricity rates in an increasing number of areas around the world investment levels in capital equipment remained depressed global solar pv production capacity exceeds enddemand resulting in a continued challenging environment and causing solar cell and wafering customers to defer purchases of new capacity to preserve capital the rationalization of capacity will be an important factor in determining when supply and demand come back into balance adding to market uncertainty are international trade actions against chinese solar manufacturers commenced in the us and other regions that have resulted in the imposition of some import sanctions with others still under consideration with respect to its csi equipment products applied competes with a number of other companies some of which have significant experience with solar applications and some of which are new entrants to the solar equipment market the solar industry downturn has affected many of applieds competitors and customers adversely with some companies going through extensive financial and organizational restructuring and in some instances ceasing operations 

patents and licenses 

management believes that applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon the company’s research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has approximately 10400 patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in applied’s best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in responding to such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

risk factors 

tableend the following factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm and they should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

the industries that applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor flat panel display and solar industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital enduse demand consumer buying patterns and inventory levels relative to demand as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales operating expenses and net income 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees 

applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy 

uncertain global economic conditions and weak or moderate growth in china europe and the united states along with uncertainties in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industries in which applied operates the markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for pv installations economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services which may in turn reduce applieds net sales reduce backlog and affect applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied’s products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in addition applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for andor the profitability of applieds products including

tableend introduction 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied’s business and results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with applied’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10k mda consists of the following sections 

  

 overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar photovoltaic pv and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips flat panel liquid crystal and other displays solar pv cells and modules and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in part i item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in north america europe and asia applied’s equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products each of applied’s businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips display technologies solar pvs and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes in light of this cyclicality applieds results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter as a result of these conditions and the changing global economic environment there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales within and across the last three fiscal years 

applieds strategic priorities for fiscal 2014 include growing its presence in wafer fab equipment and display reducing its losses in the solar business and expanding its overall available market as part of this strategy the company has implemented initiatives to decrease overhead spending and further reduce solar operating expense to fund research and development in semiconductor and other key product areas in semiconductor equipment applied intends to continue investment in 300mm 450mm and other semiconductor technologies to strengthen the product pipeline and investment in the enhancement of technical relationships with customers 

on september 24 2013 applied entered into an agreement with tokyo electron limited tel a japanese corporation and global supplier of semiconductor flat panel display and photovoltaic panel production equipment to effect a combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company the combination is expected to bring together leading technologies and products and create an expanded set of capabilities in precision materials engineering and patterning the closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions including approval by applied’s and tel’s stockholders and regulatory approvals 

results of operations 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

  



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 each contained 52 weeks 

mobility continued to be the largest influence on semiconductor industry spending during fiscal 2013 the first half of fiscal 2013 was characterized by strong demand for semiconductor equipment from foundry customers driven by demand for advanced mobile chips in the second half of the year demand from foundry customers softened reflecting seasonal consumer buying patterns for mobility products while demand from memory and logic customers improved mobility also represents a significant driver of display industry spending and demand for mobile display equipment remained strong during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2013 was also characterized by a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels in the prior year resulting from higher consumer demand in emerging markets and for larger lcd tvs in solar while end market growth continued investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2013 due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the industry 

applied expects the mobility trend to remain the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry and in turn for the silicon systems group in 2014 applied also expects the overall display investment cycle to continue into 2014 while solar equipment demand is expected to remain soft in 2014 

fiscal 2012 was characterized by significant fluctuations in demand for semiconductor equipment coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar equipment applied completed its acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 mobility was the greatest influence on semiconductor industry spending in fiscal 2012 consumer buying patterns for electronic products combined with growing semiconductor customer concentration contributed to a seasonality effect with relatively strong demand for semiconductor equipment led by foundry customers during the first half of fiscal 2012 followed by softening of demand from foundry and logic customers in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and further declines across all categories of wafer fab equipment customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 low investment levels for display equipment continued in fiscal 2012 due to decreased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions as conditions in this industry remained challenging as with the semiconductor industry demand for mobility products such as smartphones and tablets significantly influenced equipment spending in the display industry in the solar industry fiscal 2012 was characterized by continued excess manufacturing capacity which led to significantly reduced demand for crystallinesilicon csi equipment as well as weaker operating performance and outlook by the fourth quarter 

the first nine months of fiscal 2011 reflected increased demand across all segments except display due to improved global economic and industry conditions although demand softened for semiconductor display and solar equipment in the last quarter of fiscal 2011 towards the end of fiscal 2011 each of the semiconductor display and solar industries was negatively impacted by uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and the display and solar equipment industries were also negatively impacted by overcapacity 

new orders 

new orders by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



new orders for fiscal 2013 increased compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to a recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment and increased demand in semiconductor equipment partially offset by lower demand for service products as well as depressed demand for csi solar equipment due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry new orders for the silicon systems group and applied global services continued to comprise a majority of applieds consolidated total new orders 

new orders for fiscal 2012 decreased for all segments compared to the same periods in the prior year mostly due to the lower demand for csi solar and display equipment due to excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and the continued down cycle in the display industry respectively partially offset by the addition of orders attributable to varian of 10 billion the silicon systems groups and applied global services relative share of total new orders increased compared to the prior year as a result of the addition of varian and the sharp decrease in orders in display and energy and environmental solutions 

new orders by geographic region determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer were as follows 

  



the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2013 led to the increase in new orders from customers in china the change in the composition of new orders from customers in taiwan korea japan and the united states was primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment 

the decrease in new orders from customers in china in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily reflected reduced investments by solar manufacturers due to industry overcapacity 

changes in backlog during fiscal 2013 and 2012 were as follows 



backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders approximately 80 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2013 is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2014 

applied’s backlog was 24 billion  at october 27 2013  compared to 16 billion  at october 28 2012  backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2013 and totaled 191 million  primarily consisting of customer cancellations and financial debookings 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 27 2013  and october 28 2012  was as follows 

  



backlog increased in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 across all segments the increase in backlog was primarily due to increases in demand from memory customers and the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 approximately 49 percent of net sales in the silicon systems group applied’s largest business segment were for orders received and shipped within the quarter down from 53 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012

net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 net sales in display increased reflecting the recovery of tv manufacturing equipment investment while net sales across all other segments decreased the decrease primarily reflected continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and lower investments in semiconductor equipment spares and services the silicon systems group remains the largest contributor of net sales 

for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 net sales in the silicon systems group increased slightly while net sales across all other segments decreased the decreases reflected lower investments in csi solar and lcd tv equipment partially offset by sales attributable to varian 

net sales by geographic region determined by the location of customers facilities to which products were shipped were as follows 

  



the increase in net sales from customers in china in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment the changes in net sales from customers in korea the united states and taiwan were primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment 

the decrease in net sales from customers in china in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily reflected decreased investments in the solar and display industries due to overcapacity 

gross margin 

gross margins for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



reconciliations of nongaap adjusted measures are presented under nongaap adjusted results below 

gross margin and nongaap adjusted gross margin decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting lower sales gross margin percent and nongaap adjusted gross margin percent increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 despite lower sales due primarily to lower inventory charges a favorable product mix and material cost reductions gross margin and nongaap adjusted gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 due primarily to changes in segment and customer mix additional inventory charges and lower net sales partially offset by sales for a thin film solar production line in fiscal 2012 for which inventory was fully reserved prior to fiscal 2012 in addition the decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2012 was also affected by inventory fair value adjustments and intangible asset amortization associated with purchase accounting mostly associated with the acquisition of varian which amounted to 253 million in fiscal 2012 gross margin and nongaap adjusted gross margin during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  included 50 million  54 million  and 48 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

research development and engineering 

research development and engineering rde expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

in fiscal 2013 applied increased its investment in 300mm product development applied developed new applications for its epitaxial technology enabling industry transition to nmos transistors at the 20nm node and enabling chip makers to build faster devices and deliver nextgeneration mobile computing power applied also released its nextgeneration defect review and classification technology that delivers industryleading resolution used for finding identifying and analyzing defects in 3d finfet and high aspect ratio structures at 10nm nodes applied also continued to invest in the development of 450mm wafer fabrication equipment 

rde expenses increased in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year as part of its growth strategy applied has taken certain actions including workforce reductions and reprioritization of existing spend to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rd programs in current and new markets with a focus on semiconductor technologies the increase in rde for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to rde expenses related to varian of approximately 180 million and continued investment in the development of equipment for smaller linewidths and 450mm wafers partially offset by lower investments in solar rd projects and the cessation of lightemitting diode led equipment development rde expense during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  included 53 million  54 million  and 46 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

marketing and selling 

marketing and selling expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to savings from restructuring programs along with a reduction in the bad debt provision during the year as a result of lower risk exposures in display and solar customers the increase in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to marketing and selling expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of varian marketing and selling expenses during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  included 20 million  22 million  and 16 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

general and administrative 

general and administrative ga expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



the decrease in ga for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the absence of certain costs incurred during fiscal 2012 associated with the acquisition of varian savings from restructuring programs and lower sharebased compensation expense partially offset by costs incurred associated with the business combination with tel the increase in ga expenses for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily attributable to acquisitionrelated costs and other ga expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of varian partially offset by lower variable compensation and savings associated with temporary shutdowns ga expenses during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  included 34 million  52 million  and 36 million   respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

impairment of goodwill 

during fiscal 2012 the solar industry faced increasing challenges including manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook which led to a deterioration in market conditions as a result applied performed a twostep goodwill impairment test and recorded a 421 million  goodwill impairment charge in its energy and environmental solutions segment 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 the solar industry experienced further deterioration of market conditions associated with continued manufacturing overcapacity and weaker operating performance and outlook resulting in increased uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures taking these factors into account applied reassessed its financial outlook for the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit and consequently reevaluated the recoverability of this reporting units goodwill applied performed the twostep impairment test and concluded that the energy and environmental solutions reporting units carrying value exceeded its fair value based on applieds analyses the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit as a result in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 applied recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 224 million  representing all of the remaining goodwill for this reporting unit applied also performed an impairment test for longlived assets associated with the reporting unit and determined that the majority of intangible assets were impaired mostly due to the lower longterm revenue and profitability outlook associated with products related to these intangible assets accordingly during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 applied recorded an impairment charge of 54 million  related to these intangible assets which was the amount by which the carrying value of these intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair value based on discounted projected cash flows 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  applied also performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for the remaining reporting units for impairment and determined that it was more likely than not that each of the silicon systems group applied global services and display reporting units fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test for these reporting units 

the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment in the event of future changes in business conditions applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates a material impairment charge may result at that time

also in fiscal 2013 and 2012 applied incurred 2 million  and 14 million  respectively of severance and other employeerelated costs in connection with the integration of varian 

results for fiscal 2011 included favorable adjustments of 60 million related to restructuring program charges recorded in prior years offset in part by asset impairment charges of 30 million primarily related to certain intangible assets 

for further details see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

gain on sale of facilities net 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 applied received 39 million in proceeds from the sale of a property located in north america and incurred a loss of 1 million on the transaction in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 applied received 60 million in proceeds from the sale of another property located in north america and incurred a gain of 28 million on the transaction 

impairments of strategic investments 

equity investments in privatelyheld companies are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for otherthantemporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an otherthantemporary decline in value may have occurred if applied determines that an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred the investment will be written down to its estimated fair value based on available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing current cash positions earnings and cash flow forecasts recent operational performance and any other readily available market data during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  applied determined that certain of its equity investments held in privatelyheld companies were otherthantemporarily impaired and accordingly recognized impairment charges of 6 million  17 million  and 3 million  respectively 

interest expense and interest and other income net 

interest expense and interest and other income net for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in june 2011 to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition of varian interest expense remained flat during fiscal 2013 from the prior year while interest expense increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 mainly due to the full year of interest expense incurred on the senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2012 

interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments and realized gains on sale of securities interest and other income was essentially flat for fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 is due to lower cash and investment balances after completion of the acquisition of varian decreased realized gains on investment securities and lower interest rates 

income taxes 

income tax expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was significantly lower than the rate for fiscal 2012 due primarily to the geographic composition of applieds pretax income lower nondeductible goodwill impairment charges and reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit retroactive to its expiration in december 2012 these reductions were partially offset by a lower benefit in fiscal 2013 from the us federal domestic production deduction which was limited by us federal taxable income 

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was significantly higher than the rate for fiscal 2011 due primarily to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2012 and the fiscal 2011 benefit from the december 2010 reinstatement of the us rd tax credit retroactive to its expiration in december 2009 

segment information 

applied reports financial results in four segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level these unallocated costs include costs for sharebased compensation certain management finance legal human resources and rde functions provided at the corporate level and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy in addition applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment 

the results for each reportable segment are discussed below 

silicon systems group segment 

the silicon systems group segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition etch ion implantation rapid thermal processing chemical mechanical planarization metrology and inspection and wafer packaging development efforts are focused on solving customers key technical challenges in transistor patterning interconnect and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes the mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending as it drives device manufacturers to deliver highperformance lowpower processors and affordable solidstate storage in a small form factor

during fiscal 2013  applied’s board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of 010 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of 009 per share during fiscal 2012  applied’s board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of 009 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of 008 per share during fiscal 2011  applied’s board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of 008  per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of 007  cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  amounted to 456 million  434 million  and 397 million  respectively applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied’s financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied’s stockholders 

applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to 16 billion  of which 15 billion  is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that was extended by one  year in may 2013 and is scheduled to expire in may 2017  this agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 27 2013  remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately 82 million  are with japanese banks applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen no  amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 27 2013  and october 28 2012  and applied has not utilized these credit facilities 

in fiscal 2011 applied established a shortterm commercial paper program of up to 15 billion at october 27 2013  and october 28 2012  applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding 

in june 2011 applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of 175 billion the following table summarizes the notes issued in june 2011 

  



the indenture governing the notes includes certain covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 27 2013  see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of longterm debt 

others 

during fiscal 2013 applied did not record any additional bad debt provision but reversed 13 million  of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of lower risk exposures in display and solar customers while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 27 2013  is adequate it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions 

as of october 27 2013  approximately 12 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to us taxes if repatriated for us operations of this amount applied intends to permanently reinvest approximately 800 million of these funds outside of the us and does not plan to repatriate these funds for the remaining cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries us taxes have been provided for in the financial statements 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries as of october 27 2013  the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 41 million  applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements 

applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide including overdraft arrangements issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit as of october 27 2013  applied materials inc has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately 102 million  to cover these arrangements 

applied also has operating leases for various facilities total rent expense was 36 million  for fiscal 2013  38 million  for fiscal 2012  and 44 million  for fiscal 2011  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 27 2013  

  



 

 in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above applied has certain tax obligations gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of october 27 2013  the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 194 million  increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions were 7 million  as of october 27 2013  and 7 million  as of october 28 2012  which were classified as a noncurrent liability in the consolidated balance sheets at this time applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and accordingly such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements in addition applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units moreover judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets a severe decline in market conditions could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective tax rate as required if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryovers deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied’s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowance 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap adjusted results 

management uses nongaap adjusted results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes applied believes these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods the nongaap adjusted results presented below exclude the impact of the following where applicable certain acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges and any associated adjustments impairments of assets goodwill or investments gain or loss on sale of facilities and certain tax items these nongaap adjusted measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from nongaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances applied’s investment portfolio includes fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 10 billion  at october 27 2013  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 27 2013  an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 18 million while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporary at october 27 2013  the carrying amount of debt issued by applied was 19 billion  with an estimated fair value of 21 billion  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied’s debt issuances of approximately 170 million at october 27 2013  

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen euro israeli shekel taiwanese dollar and swiss franc applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 24 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

in certain cases applied uses derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 as part of an overall risk management strategy applied purchased foreign exchange option contracts to limit its foreign exchange risk associated with the announced business combination with tel in the event there is a significant weakening in the japanese yen as compared to the us dollar the derivatives used to hedge the currency exposure did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment at october 27 2013 the fair value of the foreign exchange currency option contracts was approximately 17 million  applied recognized a loss of 7 million  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to such contracts changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen would impact applieds consolidated financial statements the future maximum loss exposure on this option contract is generally limited to its fair value as of the most recent balance sheet date for further details see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements

business 

tableend incorporated in 1967 applied a delaware corporation provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar photovoltaic pv and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips flat panel liquid crystal displays lcds solar pv cells and modules and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied’s fiscal year ends on the last sunday in october 

applied is one of the world’s largest semiconductor fabrication equipment suppliers based on revenue with the capability to provide global deployment and support services applied also is a leading supplier of lcd fabrication equipment to the flat panel display industry and a leading supplier of solar pv manufacturing systems to the solar industry based on revenue 

applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions applied manages its business based upon these segments a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

in november 2011 applied completed the acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian the leading supplier of ion implantation equipment to the semiconductor and solar industries the acquisition broadened applieds extensive portfolio of technologies for chip and solar module manufacturing the acquired business is included in consolidated results of operations and the results of the silicon systems group and applied global services segments 

net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



silicon systems group segment 

the silicon systems group segment develops manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips also referred to as integrated circuits ics most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components such as transistors and other devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring interconnects applied offers systems that perform most of the primary processes used in chip fabrication including atomic layer deposition ald chemical vapor deposition cvd physical vapor deposition pvd electrochemical deposition ecd rapid thermal processing rtp ion implantation chemical mechanical planarization cmp wet cleaning and wafer metrology and inspection as well as systems that etch or inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build and package memory logic and other types of chips 

most chips are currently fabricated using 32 nanometer nm and larger linewidth dimensions although applied is also working with customers on leadingedge technology for advanced nodes using 28nm and smaller dimensions to build a chip the transistors capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove portions of successive film layers similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer as the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing capability in the same or smaller physical area the complexity of building the chip also increases necessitating more process steps to form smaller structures and more intricate wiring schemes a typical simplified process sequence for building the wiring or interconnect portion of a chip involves initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a cvd system an etch system is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer to form the metal interconnects these openings and patterns are filled with conducting material using pvd and ecd technologies a cmp step then polishes the wafer to achieve a flat surface additional deposition etch and cmp steps are then performed to build up the layers needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements advanced chip designs require more than 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle 

todays advanced interconnects are made using copper as the main wiring material copper has low resistance and can carry a large amount of current in a small area which allows signals to travel quickly applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing copperbased interconnects including equipment for depositing etching and planarizing these multilayer structures in 2012 the company introduced the applied endura amber™ pvd system which uses innovative copper reflow technology to achieve rapid voidfree fill of interconnect structures at virtually any device node 

to increase the speed of interconnect signals even further low dielectric constant low k films are used to insulate the copper wiring applied also leads the industry in providing systems for depositing low k dielectric films in 2012 the company launched the applied producer ®  onyx™ process an innovative film treatment that optimizes the molecular structure of low k films to enable higher device performance and longer battery life 

the transistor is another key area of the chip where semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs to enhance performance applied has the industry’s largest portfolio of technically advanced products for building smaller and faster transistors one method of enhancing chip performance is strain engineering a technique that stretches or compresses the space between atoms allowing electrical current to flow more quickly multiple strain films are typically used in advanced devices since they have an additive effect on increasing transistor speed applied has a comprehensive portfolio of systems to enable these applications using cvd and epitaxial deposition technologies 

major chipmakers are integrating new high dielectric constant highk and metal materials and processes in their transistor gate structures to increase chip performance and reduce power consumption applied has a comprehensive portfolio of fully characterized processes for building these highkmetal gates these solutions include an integrated dielectric gate stack tool that combines four critical processes in a single system a portfolio of metallization technologies using ald and pvd and an innovative high temperature etch system 

to address the need for higher performance in a smaller space driven by new consumer products a new type of chip packaging is emerging known as threedimensional 3d ics providing greater functionality in a smaller footprint 3d ics stack multiple chips together and electrically connect them using deep holes called throughsilicon via tsv structures applied has the industry’s most comprehensive line of productionproven systems and processes required for the majority of advanced packaging manufacturing steps including etch cvd pvd ecd wafer cleaning and cmp systems in 2012 the company introduced the applied producer optiva™ cvd system which employs ultralow process temperatures to deposit conformal insulating liner films for tsvs the optiva system is also used to manufacture advanced image sensors used in smartphones tablet pcs and highend cameras covering the microlens with a tough thin transparent film layer that boosts the lowlight performance of the sensor while improving its durability 

some chip manufacturers have announced that they will be employing new manufacturing methods to enhance chip performance one of which is based on new transistor designs that replace the traditional twodimensional gate with a thin 3d gate this new structure targeted for the 22nm technology node and below improves the performance and energy efficiency of the chip the applied centura conforma™ system uses conformal plasma doping technology to modify the electrical properties of 3d and planar transistor structures chip manufacturers are also beginning to employ 3d architectures in advanced memory chips to provide higherdensity storage capability these structures require the precise etching of exceptionally deep and narrow structures in 2012 the company launched its applied centura® avatar™ dielectric etch system that can etch holes and trenches with up to 801 depthtowidth aspect ratios 

most of applied’s semiconductor equipment products are singlewafer systems with multiple process chambers attached to a base platform this enables each wafer to be processed separately in its own environment allowing precise process control while the system’s multiple chambers enable simultaneous high productivity manufacturing applied sells most of its singlewafer multichamber systems on six basic platforms the endura ®  centura ®  producer ®  raider ®  viista ®  and vantage ®  platforms these platforms support ald cvd ecd pvd etch ion implantation and rtp technologies 

over time the semiconductor industry has migrated to increasingly larger wafers to build chips the predominant or common wafer size used today for volume production of advanced chips is 300 millimeter mm or 12inch wafers applied offers a comprehensive range of 300mm systems through its silicon systems group segment applied also offers earliergeneration 200mm systems as well as products and services to support all of its systems which are reported under its applied global services segment 

the following summarizes the portfolio of products and their associated process technology areas reported under the silicon systems group segment 

deposition 

deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip during deposition layers of dielectric an insulator barrier or electrically conductive typically metal films are deposited or grown on a wafer applied provides equipment to perform four types of deposition ald cvd ecd and pvd in addition applied’s rtp systems can be used to perform certain types of dielectric deposition 

atomic layer deposition 

ald is an advanced technology in which atoms are deposited one layer at a time to build chip structures this technology enables customers to fabricate thin films of either conducting or insulating material with uniform coverage in nanometersized structures one of the most critical areas of the transistor is its gate which is built by depositing layers of dielectric films at the 22nm node and below these film layers are so thin that they must be atomically engineered the applied centura integrated gate stack system features advanced ald technology that builds ultrathin highk film layers less than 2nm in thickness — about one hundred thousandth the width of a human hair 

chemical vapor deposition

competition 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity and costeffectiveness the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete with a single product andor in a single region to global diversified companies with a range of products applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde marketing and sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability as a result products within the silicon systems group segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a broad portfolio of technologically differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry with some offering a single product line and others offering multiple product lines these competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies the competitive environment for the silicon systems group in fiscal 2012 reflected continued investment in the semiconductor industry driven by capacity demand for mobile computing foundry customers led capacity additions for advanced technology nodes and were the primary drivers for net sales of the silicon systems group 

products and services within the applied global services segment complement the silicon systems group display and energy and environmental solutions segments’ products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to improve tool performance lower overall cost of ownership and increase the productivity and energy efficiency of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered industry conditions that affected applied global services’ sales of spares and services in fiscal 2012 were principally semiconductor manufacturers wafer starts and factory utilization rates 

products in the display segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors applied holds established market positions with its technicallydifferentiated tftlcd manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd pvd array pvd touch panel and tft array testing although its market position could change quickly due to customers evolving requirements the competitive environment for the display segment in fiscal 2012 was characterized by the weakest level of industry investment in tv manufacturing equipment in recent history while investment continued in equipment to make touch screen and highend mobile devices important factors affecting the competitive position of applieds display products include industry trends applieds ability to innovate and develop new products and the extent to which applieds products are technicallydifferentiated as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and applieds existing position at these customers 

applieds products within the energy and environmental solutions segment compete in several diverse market areas including primarily the csi solar equipment market all of these markets are characterized by extreme pressure to reduce customers overall production costs and improve performance in relation to solar for fiscal 2012 endmarket demand continued to be robust as the industry further reduced manufacturing costs and made conversion efficiency improvements enabling pvgenerated electricity to reach parity with retail electricity rates in an increasing number of areas around the world however excess manufacturing capacity relative to enddemand created an exceptionally challenging environment causing solar cell and wafering customers to defer purchases of new capacity to preserve capital and resulting in some industry consolidation the rationalization of capacity will be an important factor in determining when supply and demand come back into balance adding to market uncertainty are international trade actions against chinese solar manufacturers commenced in the us and other regions that have resulted in the imposition of sanctions with respect to its csi equipment products applied competes with a number of other companies some of which have significant experience with solar applications and some of which are new entrants to the solar equipment market the solar industry downturn has affected many of applieds competitors and customers adversely with some companies going through extensive financial and organizational restructuring 

patents and licenses 

management believes that applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon the company’s research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a substantial number of patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in applied’s best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in responding to such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

risk factors 

tableend the following factors could materially affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business 

the industries that applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor flat panel display and solar industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital enduse demand and inventory levels relative to demand as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales operating expenses and net income more recently consumer buying patterns for electronic products combined with growing customer concentration have led to a seasonality effect in demand for semiconductor equipment particularly from foundry customers 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs if applied does not accurately forecast and timely and appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment applied’s business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy 

uncertain global economic conditions and slowing or negative growth in china europe and the united states along with continuing difficulties in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions including a potential “fiscal cliff” in the us if remedial legislation is not enacted by december 31 2012 and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industries in which applied operates the markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for pv installations economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services which may in turn reduce applieds net sales reduce backlog and affect applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied’s products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts 

if applied does not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets applied’s business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries including 

 if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes in the semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

the largest proportion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the silicon systems group to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry in addition to the general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor including 

 19 

 

applied must accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections such as the transition to 20nm devices in order to enable opportunities for market share gains in addition the proposed industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers presents opportunities as well as risks and uncertainties including those related to cost technical complexity timing and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment and services recently several semiconductor customers have invested in another wafer fabrication equipment supplier to help fund development of 450mm and other new technologies which may influence the timing of technology transitions funding allocations or other matters if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from these and other ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry 

investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility current global solar pv production capacity exceeds anticipated nearterm enduse demand causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology or to cease operations in addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor the global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for andor the profitability of applied’s solar products including 

 20 

 if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry 

the global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of lcd manufacturers the concentrated nature of lcd enduse applications and excess production capacity relative to enduse demand industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced lcd tvs which demand has slowed significantly and more recently on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features in addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry including 

 if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied must continually innovate commercialize its products and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes 

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical its future success depends on many factors including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment services and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including enhancing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates while constantly improving its operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative geographically diverse open and varied competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely costeffectively and successfully 

 21 

 if applied does not successfully manage these challenges its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s semiconductor customer base historically has been and is becoming even more highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions in fiscal 2012 three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for 60 percent of silicon systems group net sales and two customers accounted for 36 percent of applied’s consolidated net sales applied’s display customer base is also highly concentrated while concentration within applied’s solar customer base varies depending on the product line but is increasing due to challenging industry conditions applied’s customer base is also geographicallyconcentrated in fiscal 2012 customers in taiwan accounted for 32 percent of net sales for the silicon systems group segment while customers in korea and the us together constituted 49 percent customers in taiwan and china accounted for a total of 66 percent of net sales for the display segment and customers in china accounted for 49 percent of net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment 

in addition certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes consolidated with other manufacturers outsourced manufacturing activities or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners also certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments further claims or litigation involving key industry participants may result in changes in sourcing strategies and other outcomes in this environment contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s business which may result in added complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions and make it more challenging for applied’s business units to generate organic growth in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

in fiscal 2012 approximately 80 percent  of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states moreover china now represents the largest market for various electronic products such as tvs pcs and smartphones certain of applied’s rd and manufacturing facilities as well as suppliers to applied are also located outside the united states including in singapore taiwan china korea israel germany italy and switzerland applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries the global nature of applied’s business and operations combined with the need to continually improve the company’s operating cost structure presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

 22 

property labor tax and importexport laws as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations 

 many of these challenges are present in china and korea which are experiencing significant growth of customers suppliers and competitors to applied applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions these challenges may materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

operating in multiple industries and the entry into new markets and industries entail additional challenges and obligations 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions the entry into different markets involves additional challenges including those arising from 

 23 

 • new materials processes and technologies 

 in addition applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied may be subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from its diversification and entry into new markets and industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers including contract manufacturers some key parts are subject to long leadtimes andor obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing including china and korea cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital technical operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain further the adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns have caused and may continue to cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost sociallyresponsible business practices or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources which could entail manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders applied may incur excess inventory charges any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

applied’s success competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees especially in critical positions achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions management changes applied’s organizational structure competitors’ hiring practices cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and the effectiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions which may result in unexpected costs reduced productivity andor difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls if applied does not successfully attract retain and motivate key employees with appropriate skills applied may be unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its business financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments 

applied has made and in the future intends to make acquisitions of or investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied in november 2011 applied completed its acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian which was the company’s largest acquisition to date acquisitions involve numerous risks that vary depending on the scale and nature of the acquisition including but not limited to 

 25 

 applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks if applied does not successfully manage the risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights 

applied from time to time is and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights antitrust environmental regulations securities contracts product performance product liability unfair competition misappropriation of trade secrets employment workplace safety and other matters applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties 

in february 2010 the seoul prosecutor’s office for the eastern district in korea indicted certain employees of applied materials korea amk including the former head of amk who at the time of indictment was a vice president of applied materials inc along with employees of several other companies alleging the improper receipt and use of confidential information of samsung electronics co ltd samsung a major customer hearings on these matters have been ongoing on november 22 2012 the court held the last hearing and scheduled the announcement of its decision for january 24 2013 

legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may 1 be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct 2 divert management’s attention and other applied resources 3 inhibit applied’s ability to sell its products 4 result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines andor 5 negatively affect applied’s business there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings claims or investigations if applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle legal proceedings or claims or in the event of any adverse findings against applied or any of its employees applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and applied may suffer harm to its reputation 

in addition applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights furthermore the laws and practices of other countries including china india taiwan and korea permit the protection and enforcement of applied’s rights to varying extents which may not be sufficient to adequately protect applied’s rights applied previously entered into an arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future there can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with the arrangement if applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle claims obtain or enforce intellectual property rights obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and applied may suffer harm to its reputation 

the failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations 

to better align its costs with market conditions locate closer to customers enhance productivity and improve efficiencies applied conducts certain engineering software development manufacturing sourcing and other operations in regions outside the united states including india taiwan china and korea applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries including the united states europe israel singapore taiwan and other countries in asia and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites in addition applied outsources certain functions to third parties including companies in the united states india china korea malaysia and other countries outsourced functions include contract manufacturing engineering customer support software development information technology support finance and administrative activities the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies assure quality and continuity of supply and protect the intellectual property of applied and its customers suppliers and other partners if applied does not accurately forecast the amount timing and mix of demand for products or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer particularly during a market upturn 

in addition applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations including initiatives to enhance the asia supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing applied also is implementing a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions the implementation of additional functionality to the erp system entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt applied’s operations such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products project inventory requirements manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data during transitions applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems which may be costly or inefficient while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities negatively affect employee morale or have other unintended consequences 

if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties increased costs including energy and transportation manufacturing interruptions or delays inefficiencies in the structure andor operation of its supply chain loss of its intellectual property rights quality issues reputational harm increased product timetomarket andor inefficient allocation of human resources any or all of which could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or longlived assets 

applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the review compares the fair value for each of applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value including goodwill factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows declines in the market price of applied common stock changes in applied’s strategies or product portfolio and restructuring activities applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 applied concluded that the carrying value of the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit exceeded its fair value and accordingly recorded a 421 million goodwill impairment charge applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which could materially and adversely affect applied’s results of operations 

changes in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations 

as a global company applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in the 1 applicable tax laws 2 amount and composition of pretax income in countries with differing tax rates 3 plans of the company to permanently reinvest certain funds held outside of the us or 4 valuation of applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 

to better align with the increasingly international nature of its business applied is transitioning certain manufacturing supply chain and other operations into asia bringing these activities closer to customers these changes are expected to result in a reduction of future operating costs applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the us will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates to obtain the benefit of these tax provisions applied must meet requirements relating to various activities applied’s ability to realize benefits from these provisions could be materially affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met or if applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction 

in addition applied is subject to regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes which requires estimates and judgments although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates which may be timeconsuming and expensive there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals which could materially and adversely affect applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

applied is subject to risks of noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations 

applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacture and use of its products recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products the operation of its facilities and the use of its real property the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations such as those related to climate change could result in 1 significant remediation liabilities 2 the imposition of fines 3 the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of its products 4 limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property andor 5 a decrease in the value of its real property each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment 

applied is subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations for example as a public company with global operations applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy and anticorruption changes in laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if applied is found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws rules or regulations applied could be subject to legal or regulatory sanctions the public’s and customers’ perception of applied could decline and applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend introduction 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied’s business and results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with applied’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10k mda consists of the following sections 

  

 overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar photovoltaic pv and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips flat panel liquid crystal displays lcds solar pv cells and modules and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in north america europe and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products each of applied’s businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips lcds solar pvs and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes in light of this cyclicality applieds results can vary significantly yearoveryear as well as quarteroverquarter 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

  



reconciliations of nongaap measures are presented under nongaap results below fiscal 2012 and 2011 each contained 52 weeks each while fiscal 2010 contained 53 weeks 

fiscal 2012 was a year characterized by significant fluctuations in demand for semiconductor equipment which is applieds largest business coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar equipment mobility connectivity and cloud computing trends drove the semiconductor industry spending with mobility as the biggest influence applied also completed its acquisition of varian in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 consumer buying patterns for electronic products combined with growing semiconductor customer concentration contributed to a seasonality effect with relatively strong demand for semiconductor equipment led by foundry customers during the first half of fiscal 2012 followed by softening of demand from foundry and logic customers in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and further declines across all categories of wafer fab equipment customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 low investment levels for display equipment continued in fiscal 2012 characterized by decreased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions as conditions in this industry remained challenging as with the semiconductor industry demand for mobility products such as smartphones and tablets significantly influenced equipment spending in the display industry in the solar industry fiscal 2012 was characterized by continued excess manufacturing capacity which led to significantly reduced demand for csi equipment as well as weaker operating performance and outlook by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

the first nine months of fiscal 2011 reflected increased demand across all segments except display due to more favorable global economic and industry conditions than in fiscal 2010 although demand softened for semiconductor lcd and solar equipment in the last quarter of fiscal 2011 towards the end of fiscal 2011 the semiconductor lcd and solar industries were negatively impacted by uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and the lcd and solar equipment industries were also negatively impacted by overcapacity 

applieds strategic priorities for 2013 include expanding market share in wafer fab equipment and growing its technical capabilities extending its technology leadership in solar and display equipment and enhancing its organization in key product areas in semiconductor equipment applied intends to increase investment in 300mm and 450mm research and development and enhance the technical field team in addition applied plans to make selective investments in developing enabling technologies for display and solar products 

results of operations 

the following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information 

  



orders and sales for manufacturing equipment historically has been volatile across all segments as a result of sudden changes in demand and other factors including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 as a result of these conditions and the changing global economic environment there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales both within and across the three fiscal years as of the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 the semiconductor display and solar equipment industries were each in a capacitydriven downturn the nature and timing of a recovery in capital equipment investment are expected to depend largely on the macroeconomic environment 

new orders 

new orders by geographic region determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer were as follows 

  



  

new orders for fiscal 2012 decreased from fiscal 2011 reflecting a steep decline in demand for csi solar equipment combined with reduced demand for lcd tv and semiconductor equipment partially offset by new orders of 10 billion  attributable to varian the reduction in new orders from customers in china primarily reflected the decreased investments in the solar industry due to overcapacity customers in taiwan united states and korea together represented 74 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2012 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 new orders were 15 billion  down 19 percent  from the prior quarter reflecting lower semiconductor equipment demand partially offset by modest order increases in other segments 

new orders for fiscal 2011 were slightly down from fiscal 2010 primarily attributable to decreased demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers and decreased demand for lcd tv equipment partially offset by increased demand for touch panel tools from display customers and increased demand for csi equipment from solar manufacturers customers in taiwan united states and china together represented 62 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2011 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 new orders were 16 billion down 33 percent from the third quarter of fiscal 2011 

new orders by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



new orders for fiscal 2012 decreased for all segments compared to the same periods in the prior year mostly due to the excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and the continued down cycle in the display industry partially offset by the addition of orders attributable to varian of 10 billion the silicon systems groups and applied global services relative share of total new orders increased compared to the prior year as a result of the addition of varian and the sharp decrease in orders in display and energy and environmental solutions 

for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 new orders by segment as well as the relative share of total new orders for the silicon systems group and display decreased while new orders by segment as well as the relative share of new orders in applied global services and energy and environmental solutions increased 

changes in backlog during fiscal 2012 and 2011 were as follows 



backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized and 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders approximately 75 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2012 is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2013 

applied’s backlog was 16 billion  at october 28 2012  as compared to 24 billion  at october 30 2011  backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2012 and totaled 104 million  primarily consisting of customer cancellations 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 28 2012  and october 30 2011  was as follows 

  



backlog decreased in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 across all segments reflecting decreased demand for semiconductor lcd and solar equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 approximately 53 percent of net sales in the silicon systems group applied’s largest business segment were for orders received and shipped within the quarter up from 45 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

net sales 

net sales by geographic region determined by the location of customers facilities to which products were shipped were as follows 

  



net sales for fiscal 2012 decreased from the prior year primarily due to decreased industry investment in csi solar products and lcd tv equipment partially offset by sales attributable to varian net sales attributable to varian were 10 billion  for fiscal 2012 the reduction in net sales from customers in china primarily reflected the decreased investments in the solar and display industries due to overcapacity customers in taiwan korea and united states combined represented 70 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2012 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 net sales were 16 billion  down 30 percent  from the prior quarter led by a reduction in semiconductor equipment sales 

net sales for fiscal 2011 increased from fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased industry investment in csi solar equipment and higher sales of spares and refurbished semiconductor equipment customers in china taiwan and united states combined represented 63 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2011 

net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 net sales in the silicon systems group increased slightly while net sales across all other segments decreased the decrease reflected lower investments in csi solar and lcd tv equipment partially offset by sales attributable to varian the silicon systems groups relative share of total net sales increased compared to the prior year and remains the largest contributor of net sales 

for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 net sales in the silicon systems group remained essentially flat while net sales in energy and environment solutions and applied global services increased due to increased demand for csi equipment and spare parts and refurbished equipment respectively net sales in display decreased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to a weaker lcd tv market for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the relative share of total net sales in the silicon systems group decreased while the relative share of total net sales in energy and environmental solutions increased the increase in energy and environmental solutions’ relative share of total net sales was due to increased demand for csi equipment 

gross margin 

gross margins for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



reconciliations of nongaap measures are presented under nongaap results below 

gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 due primarily to changes in segment and customer mix inventory fair value adjustments and intangible asset amortization associated with purchase accounting additional inventory reserves and lower net sales partially offset by sales for a single thin film solar production line for which inventory was fully reserved prior to fiscal 2012 inventory fair value adjustments and intangible asset amortization mostly associated with the acquisition of varian were 253 million in fiscal 2012 inventory charges of approximately 290 million were recorded in fiscal 2012 as a result of the softening of demand for semiconductorrelated businesses and continued weakness in the solar industry of the total inventory charges during fiscal 2012 13 million were recorded in connection with the restructuring of the energy and environmental solutions segment the increase in gross margin and nongaap gross margin in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was principally 

attributable to the inventoryrelated charges of 330 million incurred in fiscal 2010 associated with sunfab thin film solar equipment which lowered gross margin for fiscal 2010 by approximately 3 percentage points gross margin during fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  included 54 million  48 million  and 32 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



the increase in sga expenses for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily attributable to acquisitionrelated costs and other sga expenses incurred in connection with varian which totaled 190 million partially offset by lower variable compensation and savings associated with temporary shutdowns the decrease in sga expenses for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 reflected lower expenses as a result of the restructuring of the energy and environmental solutions segment that occurred in fiscal 2010 sga expenses for fiscal 2011 included 19 million in transaction costs associated with the acquisition of varian while fiscal 2010 included 10 million in transaction costs associated with the acquisition of semitool inc sga expenses during fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  included 74 million  52 million  and 51 million  respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

impairment of goodwill 

applied tested goodwill of the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit for potential impairment during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 in light of second quarter developments that included current industry trends financial performance weaker shortterm outlooks and other adverse operating conditions within the solar industry the results of the first step of the impairment test indicated that goodwill of the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit was not impaired at that time during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 applied noted no events that would significantly impact the results of the impairment test performed in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 however during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  the solar industry faced increasing challenges of solar panel manufacturing overcapacity and weaker operating performance and outlook leading to the deterioration of the solar equipment market and applieds customers financial condition coupled with lower market valuations taking these factors into account applied reassessed its financial outlook of the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit and consequently reevaluated the recoverability of energy and environmental solutions goodwill accordingly applied performed the twostep impairment test and concluded that the energy and environmental solutions reporting units carrying value exceeded its fair value and recorded a 421 million  goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  applied also performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for the remaining reporting units for impairment and determined that it was more likely than not that each of the silicon systems group applied global services and display reporting units fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test for these reporting units 

the evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment in the event of future changes in business conditions applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates a material impairment charge may result at that time

impairments of strategic investments 

equity investments in privatelyheld companies are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for otherthantemporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an otherthantemporary decline in value may have occurred if applied determines that an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred the investment will be written down to its estimated fair value based on available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing current cash positions earnings and cash flow forecasts recent operational performance and any other readily available market data during fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  applied determined that certain of its equity investments held in privatelyheld companies were otherthantemporarily impaired and accordingly recognized impairment charges of 17 million  3 million  and 13 million  respectively 

interest and other expenses 

interest and other expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



the increase in interest and other expense for fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 is mainly due to the full year of interest expense incurred on the senior unsecured notes issued in june 2011 to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition of varian the increase in interest and other expense for fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was primarily due to interest of 31 million payable on senior unsecured notes issued in fiscal 2011 and to fees of 8 million associated with a bridge loan facility that was entered into and terminated during fiscal 2011 

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net for the past three fiscal years was as follows 

  



the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 is due to lower cash and investment balances after completion of the acquisition of varian decreased realized gains on investment securities and lower interest rates the increase in interest and other income in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in gains realized on sale of investment securities 

income taxes 

income tax expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 is significantly higher than the rate for fiscal 2011 due primarily to the recording of goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2012 which are not deductible for tax purposes in addition the tax rate for fiscal 2011 benefited from a favorable us internal revenue service audit settlement the tax rates for fiscal 2012 and 2011 both benefited from tax incentives offered in several jurisdictions and fiscal 2011 benefited from the december 2010 reinstatement of the us rd tax credit retroactive to its prior expiration in december 2009 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 did not include the impact of the us rd tax credit from the time it expired in december 2009 applied’s effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation and the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income

for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks see offbalance sheet arrangements below 

offbalance sheet arrangements

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 28 2012 

  



 

 in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above applied has certain tax obligations gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of october 28 2012  the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 174 million  exclusive of interest and penalties increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions were 7 million  as of october 28 2012  and 1 million  as of october 30 2011  which were classified as a longterm liability in the consolidated balance sheets at this time applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and accordingly such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements in addition applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units moreover judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied’s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowance 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap results 

management uses nongaap results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes applied believes these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods the nongaap results presented below exclude the impact of the following where applicable certain discrete tax items restructuring charges and any associated adjustments certain acquisitionrelated costs impairments of assets goodwill or investments andor gain or loss on sale of facilities these nongaap measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from nongaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions applied manages its business based upon these segments a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

silicon systems group segment 

applied’s silicon systems group segment develops manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips also referred to as integrated circuits ics most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components such as transistors and other devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring interconnects applied offers systems that perform most of the primary processes used in chip fabrication including atomic layer deposition ald chemical vapor deposition cvd physical vapor deposition pvd electrochemical deposition ecd rapid thermal processing rtp chemical mechanical planarization cmp wet cleaning and wafer metrology and inspection as well as systems that etch or inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build and package memory logic and other types of chips 

most chips currently are fabricated using 45 nanometer nm and larger linewidth dimensions although applied is also working with customers on leadingedge technology for advanced nodes using 32nm 22nm and smaller dimensions to build a chip the transistors capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove portions of successive film layers similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer as the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing capability in the same or smaller physical area the complexity of building the chip also increases necessitating more process steps to form smaller structures and more intricate wiring schemes a typical simplified process sequence for building the wiring or interconnect portion of a chip involves initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a cvd system an etch system is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer to form the metal interconnects these openings and patterns are filled with conducting material using pvd and ecd technologies a cmp step then polishes the wafer to achieve a flat surface additional deposition etch and cmp steps are then performed to build up the layers needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements advanced chip designs require more than 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability as a result products within the silicon systems group segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a broad portfolio of technologically differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry with some offering a single product line and others offering multiple product lines these competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies factors that influenced the competitive environment for the silicon systems group in fiscal 2011 included a softening in semiconductor industry despite higher demand for tablet computers laptop computers and cellular phones device supply and demand dynamics led manufacturers to reduce their annual wafer fab equipment wfe capital spending which is the major driver for silicon systems group net sales 

products and services within the applied global services segment complement the silicon systems group display and energy and environmental solutions segments’ products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to reduce costs improve tool performance and increase the productivity and energy efficiency of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered customers with more significant operations andor expertise may require fewer service products than customers who place greater reliance on an outsourcing model industry conditions that affected applied global services’ sales of spares and services in fiscal 2011 were principally manufacturing capacity and utilization rates of fabs 

products in the display segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors applied holds established market positions with its technicallydifferentiated tftlcd manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd pvd array pvd touch panel and tft array testing although its market position could change quickly due to customers’ evolving requirements the competitive environment for applied’s display segment in fiscal 2011 was characterized by increased demand and capacity requirements for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets pcs which drove demand for highperformance displays and touch screen devices lcd tv demand and capacity also grew but not as rapidly as in recent years important factors affecting the competitive position of applied’s display products include i industry trends applied’s ability to innovate and develop new products and the extent to which applied’s products are technicallydifferentiated ii which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and iii applied’s existing position at these customers 

applied’s products within the energy and environmental solutions segment compete in several diverse market areas including primarily the csi solar equipment market all of these markets are characterized by extreme pressure to reduce customers’ overall production costs and improve performance with respect to its csi equipment products applied competes with a number of other companies some of which have significant experience with solar applications and some of which are new entrants to the solar equipment business 

  

patents and licenses 

management believes that applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon the company’s research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a substantial number of patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in applied’s best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in responding to such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

environmental matters 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental health or safety incidents including without limitation spills releases or possible contamination 

compliance with federal state and local environmental health and safety provisions including without limitation those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following factors could materially affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

the industries that applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity and advanced technology requirements and spending which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization production volumes access to affordable capital enduse demand and inventory levels relative to demand as well as the rate of technology transitions these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales operating expenses and net income 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs if applied does not accurately forecast and timely and appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment applied’s business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

  

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes in the semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

the greatest portion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability historically has been derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the silicon systems group to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry in addition to the general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry 

the global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of lcd manufacturers and the concentrated nature of lcd enduse applications recently industry growth has depended to a considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as smartphones and other mobile devices which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features in addition to the general industry changes described above in the second risk factor the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry including 

 

  

   

  

  

 if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry 

an increasing portion of applied’s business is in the emerging solar market which in addition to the general industry changes described above in the second risk factor is characterized by ongoing changes specific to the solar industry including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition current projections for global solar pv production exceed anticipated nearterm enduse demand which is heavily dependent on installed costperwatt government policies and incentives and the availability of affordable capital an oversupply of solar pvs that leads customers to delay or reduce investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology adversely impacts the sales growth rates andor profitability of applied’s products if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

applied is exposed to risks associated with the difficult financial markets and uncertain global economy 

continuing difficulties in the financial markets national debt concerns in various regions and uncertainty regarding the global economy are posing challenges and some governments may implement policies to control economic growth the markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for pv installations economic uncertainty and related factors including unemployment inflation and fuel prices exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services which may reduce net sales reduce backlog and affect applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales difficulties in obtaining capital uncertain market conditions or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations leading to customers’ reducing research and development funding andor capital expenditures and in turn lower sales andor additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied these conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied’s products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its business sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities andor modify its business model which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery 

in addition applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio as well as returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations if one or more of these financial institutions become insolvent or are taken over by a government it could limit applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts 

if applied does not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets applied’s business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

applied must continually innovate and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes 

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical its future success depends on many factors including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment services and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including enhancing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates while constantly improving its operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative geographically diverse open and varied competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely costeffectively and successfully 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if applied does not successfully manage these challenges its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

operating in multiple industries and the entry into new markets and industries entail additional challenges and obligations 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions the entry into different markets involves additional challenges including those arising from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition applied has begun applying for and receiving funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its rd resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied may be subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from its diversification and entry into new markets and industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

in fiscal 2011 approximately 81 percent of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states certain of applied’s rd and manufacturing facilities as well as suppliers to applied are also located outside the united states including in singapore taiwan china korea israel germany italy and switzerland applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries the global nature of applied’s business and operations presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these challenges are present in china and korea which are experiencing significant growth of customers suppliers and competitors to applied applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions these challenges may materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in march 2011 japan experienced a significant earthquake aftershocks and tsunami that resulted in widespread damage and business interruptions throughout the country including those associated with radiation concerns arising from damage to a nuclear power plant certain of applied’s customers and suppliers are located in japan and applied also has sales and service centers in the country while applied has not experienced any material impact on its business or operations to date and has taken actions to enhance its ability to meet customers’ requirements applied cannot predict the extent of the impact the situation in japan may have if any on its future business and operations 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

applied’s semiconductor and flat panel display customer bases historically have been and are becoming even more highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions for example in fiscal 2011 three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for 52 percent of silicon systems group net sales and three lcd manufacturers accounted for 54 percent of display net sales further three customers accounted for 32 percent of applied’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2011 certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes consolidated with other manufacturers outsourced manufacturing activities or engaged in 

  

collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers in addition customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners also certain semiconductor and display customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments customer concentration within applied’s solar customer base varies depending on the product line for precision wafering systems five solar manufacturers accounted for 57 percent of net sales in fiscal 2011 while the baccini cell systems business has a more diffuse customer base applied’s customer base in each of the display and energy and environmental solutions segments is also geographicallyconcentrated in fiscal 2011 customers in china and taiwan accounted for a total of 78 percent of net sales for the display segment while customers in china accounted for 80 percent of net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment 

in this environment contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s business which may result in added complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions and make it more challenging for applied’s business units to generate organic growth in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers including contract manufacturers some key parts are subject to long leadtimes andor obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing including china and korea cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital technical operational and other risks for companies throughout applied’s supply chain further the adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns in recent periods have caused and may continue to cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations potentially affecting applied’s ability to obtain quality parts on a timely basis applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 

  

  

  

  

 if a supplier fails to meet applied’s requirements concerning quality cost or other performance factors applied may transfer its business to alternative sources which could entail manufacturing delays additional costs or other difficulties in addition if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules this may exacerbate any interruptions in 

  

applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders applied may incur excess inventory charges any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments 

applied has made and in the future intends to make acquisitions of or investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied most recently in november 2011 applied completed its acquisition of varian semiconductor associates inc varian which was the company’s largest acquisition to date acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ven 

  

tures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks if applied does not successfully manage the risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied used existing cash and incurred debt obligations to acquire varian that could affect its ability to respond to changes in business conditions or otherwise adversely affect its business 

applied financed the acquisition of varian through a combination of existing cash balances and the net proceeds of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of 175 billion issued on june 8 2011 the reduction in cash balances assumed lower interest income and payments on the debt obligations will reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes such as further mergers and acquisitions this in turn may reduce applied’s flexibility in responding to changes in its businesses and in the industries in which it operates 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

applied’s success competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees especially in critical positions and in growing markets achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions applied’s organizational structure competitors’ hiring practices cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns availability of career development opportunities and the effectiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs if applied does not successfully attract retain and motivate key employees applied may be unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its business financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

the failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations 

to better align its costs with market conditions locate closer to customers enhance productivity and improve efficiencies applied conducts certain engineering software development manufacturing sourcing and other operations in regions outside the united states including india taiwan china and korea applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries including the united states europe israel singapore taiwan and other countries in asia and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites in addition applied outsources certain functions to third parties including companies in the united states india china korea malaysia and other countries outsourced functions include contract manufacturing engineering customer support software development information technology support finance and administrative activities the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies assure quality and continuity of supply and protect the intellectual property of applied and its customers suppliers and other partners if applied does not accurately forecast the amount timing and mix of demand for products or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer particularly during a market upturn 

in addition applied is implementing a comprehensive program to better align its global organizations and processes including initiatives to enhance the asia supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing applied also is implementing a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions the implementation of additional func 

  

tionality to the erp system entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt applied’s operations such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products project inventory requirements manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities negatively affect employee morale or have other unintended consequences 

if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties increased costs including energy and transportation manufacturing interruptions or delays inefficiencies in the structure andor operation of its supply chain loss of its intellectual property rights quality issues increased product timetomarket andor inefficient allocation of human resources any or all of which could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or longlived assets 

applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the review compares the fair value for each of applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value including goodwill factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows declines in the market price of applied common stock changes in applied’s strategies or product portfolio and restructuring activities applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance applied may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which could materially and adversely affect applied’s results of operations 

applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights 

applied from time to time is and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights antitrust environmental regulations securities contracts product performance product liability unfair competition misappropriation of trade secrets employment workplace safety and other matters applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties 

in february 2010 the seoul prosecutor’s office for the eastern district in korea indicted certain employees of applied materials korea amk including the former head of amk who at the time of indictment was a vice president of applied materials inc along with employees of several other companies alleging the improper receipt and use of confidential information of samsung electronics co ltd samsung a major customer hearings on these matters are ongoing in the seoul eastern district court applied and samsung entered into a settlement agreement effective as of november 1 2010 which resolves potential civil claims related to this matter and which is separate from and does not affect the criminal proceedings 

legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may 1 be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct 2 divert management’s attention and other applied resources 3 inhibit applied’s ability to sell its products 4 result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines andor 5 negatively affect applied’s business there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings claims or investigations if applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle legal proceedings or claims or in the event of any adverse findings against applied or any of its employees applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and applied may suffer harm to its reputation 

  

applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights furthermore the laws and practices of other countries including china india taiwan and korea permit the protection and enforcement of applied’s rights to varying extents which may not be sufficient to adequately protect applied’s rights applied previously entered into an arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future there can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with the arrangement if applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle claims obtain or enforce intellectual property rights obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and applied may suffer harm to its reputation 

changes in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations 

as a global company applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in the 1 applicable tax laws 2 amount and composition of pretax income in countries with differing tax rates 3 plans of the company to permanently reinvest certain funds held outside of the us or 4 valuation of applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 

to better align with the increasingly international nature of its business applied is transitioning certain manufacturing supply chain and other operations into asia bringing these activities closer to customers these changes are expected to result in a reduction of future operating costs in singapore applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that certain income earned in singapore will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates to obtain the benefit of these tax provisions applied must meet requirements relating to various activities applied’s ability to realize benefits from these provisions could be materially affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met or if applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction 

in addition applied is subject to regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes which requires estimates and judgments although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates which may be timeconsuming and expensive there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals which could materially and adversely affect applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

applied is subject to risks of noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations 

applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacture and use of its products recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products the operation of its facilities and the use of its real property the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations such as those related to climate change could result in 1 significant remediation liabilities 2 the imposition of fines 3 the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of its products 4 limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property andor 5 a decrease in the value of its real property each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment 

applied is subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations for example as a public company with global operations applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy and anticorruption changes in laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if applied is found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws rules or regulations applied could be subject to legal or regulatory sanctions the public’s and customers’ perception of applied could decline and applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 overview 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar photovoltaic pv and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips flat panel liquid crystal displays lcds solar pv cells and modules and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in north america europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

applied’s results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products each of applied’s businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips lcds solar pvs and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

 

   

fiscal 2011 and 2009 contained 52 weeks each while fiscal 2010 contained 53 weeks 

financial results for fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 reflected a decrease in total new orders while net sales increased to a record level and net income also increased the decline in new orders reflected softening demand for semiconductor lcd and solar equipment in the second half of the year the semiconductor industry was negatively impacted by uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment whereas the lcd and solar equipment industries were negatively impacted by overcapacity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 new orders were 16 billion down 33 percent from the prior quarter for fiscal 2011 net sales increased yearoveryear primarily due to increased industry investment in crystallinesilicon csi solar equipment and higher sales of spares and refurbished semiconductor equipment operating income for fiscal 2011 included favorable adjustments to restructuring reserves of 60 million offset in part by asset impairment charges of 30 million and a net gain on sale of facilities of 27 million in fiscal 2010 applied incurred charges totaling 486 million that included a plan to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment 

financial results for fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 reflected significantly increased demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to more favorable global economic and industry conditions the increase in total orders from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increased demand for semiconductor display and csi solar pv products partially offset by decreased demand for sunfab ™ thin film solar lines net sales increased during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due primarily to higher sales of semiconductor and display equipment in fiscal 2010 applied incurred charges totaling 486 million that included a plan to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment consisting of inventoryrelated charges of 330 million related to sunfab thin film solar equipment asset impairment charges of 108 million employee severance charges of 45 million and other costs of 3 million this action was in response to adverse market conditions for thin film solar including delays in utilityscale solar adoption solar panel manufacturers’ challenges in obtaining affordable capital changes and uncertainty in government renewable energy policies and competitive pressure from csi solar technologies as part of the restructuring applied discontinued sales to new customers of its fullyintegrated sunfab lines but continued to offer individual tools for thin film solar manufacturing applied is supporting existing sunfab customers with services upgrades and capacity increases through its applied global services segment and is continuing rde efforts to improve thin film panel efficiency and highproductivity deposition also in fiscal 2010 applied incurred charges totaling 84 million associated with a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce as of october 25 2009 by approximately 1000 positions over a period of 18 months 

fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions particularly in the first half of fiscal 2009 negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty led some customers to dramatically reduce factory operations and to reduce their spending in the second half of fiscal 2009 demand for semiconductor and display equipment increased but was still down significantly from fiscal 2008 levels fiscal 2009 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs 

in november 2011 applied completed its acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 42 billion net of cash acquired the acquisition enhances applied’s product portfolio with marketleading ion implantation technology and is expected to enable applied to become the semiconductor industry leader in transistor technologies 

  

results of operations 

the following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information 

 

 demand for manufacturing equipment historically has been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip lcd and solar pv supply and demand and other factors including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 as a result of these conditions and the changing global economic environment there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales both within and across the three fiscal years as of the end of fiscal 2011 the semiconductor display and solar equipment industries were each in a capacitydriven downturn the nature and timing of a recovery in capital equipment investment are expected to depend largely on the macroeconomic environment 

  

new orders 

new orders by geographic region which are attributed according to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

  

 

 new orders of 101 billion for fiscal 2011 were down 1 percent from fiscal 2010 the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers and decreased demand for lcd equipment partially offset by increased demand for touch panel tools from display customers and increased demand for csi equipment from solar manufacturers customers in china and taiwan together represented 42 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2011 

from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 new orders more than doubled to 102 billion the increase was principally due to greater demand for semiconductor equipment and services primarily from memory and foundry customers as well as increased demand for csi solar manufacturing products and display equipment the increase in new orders reflected the general recovery in the semiconductor equipment industry and the lcd market from the steep downturn experienced in fiscal 2009 customers in taiwan and china together represented 48 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2010 

new orders decreased 55 percent to 41 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in new orders was across all segments and particularly in the semiconductor and display businesses reflecting the challenging economic and industry conditions prevalent during fiscal 2009 customer demand for semiconductor and lcd equipment began to recover in the second half of fiscal 2009 customers in china north america and europe combined represented 52 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2009 

new orders by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 new orders by segment as well as the relative share of total new orders for the silicon systems group and display decreased while new orders by segment as well as the relative 

  

share of new orders in applied global services and energy and environmental solutions increased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 new orders increased in all segments with the relative share of total new orders increasing significantly for the silicon systems group while the relative share of new orders in applied global services and energy and environmental solutions decreased by 8 percentage points each 

applied’s backlog was 24 billion at october 30 2011 as compared to 32 billion at october 31 2010 backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2011 and totaled 504 million consisting primarily of orders with revised shipment dates outside of applied’s order policy and included 124 million in customer cancellations backlog decreased in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 primarily due to decreases in new orders for the silicon systems group and display reflecting decreased demand for semiconductor equipment and a weaker lcd market respectively backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months and 3 orders for sunfab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 approximately 45 percent of net sales in the silicon systems group applied’s largest business segment were for orders received and shipped within the quarter 

backlog by reportable segment as of october 30 2011 and october 31 2010 was as follows 

 

 net sales 

net sales by geographic region which are attributed according to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

  

 

 net sales of 105 billion for fiscal 2011 increased 10 percent from fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased industry investment in csi solar equipment and higher sales of spares and refurbished semiconductor equipment 

  

customers in china north america and taiwan combined represented 63 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2011 net sales of 95 billion for fiscal 2010 increased 90 percent from fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher sales of semiconductor equipment customers in taiwan and korea combined represented 48 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2010 net sales decreased 38 percent to 50 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of significantly lower sales of equipment and services to semiconductor and display customers partially offset by increased sales of solar manufacturing equipment customers in taiwan and north america combined represented 40 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2009 

net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 net sales in the silicon systems group remained essentially flat while net sales in energy and environment solutions and applied global services increased due to increased demand for csi equipment and spare parts and refurbished equipment respectively net sales in display reflected a decrease during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to a weaker lcd market for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the relative share of total net sales in the silicon systems group decreased while the relative share of total net sales in energy and environmental solutions increased the increase in energy and environmental solutions’ relative share of total net sales was due to increased demand for csi equipment 

gross margin 

gross margins for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was principally attributable to the absence of inventoryrelated charges incurred in fiscal 2010 associated with sunfab thin film solar equipment the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was principally attributable to higher net sales more favorable product mix improved factory utilization and continued cost control measures offset in part by inventoryrelated charges of 330 million associated with sunfab thin film solar equipment which lowered gross margin for fiscal 2010 by approximately 3 percentage points gross margin during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 included 48 million 32 million and 28 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

research development and engineering

gain on sale of facilities net 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 applied received 39 million in proceeds from the sale of a property located in north america and incurred a loss of 1 million on the transaction in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 applied received 60 million in proceeds from the sale of another property located in north america and incurred a gain of 28 million on the transaction 

interest and other expenses 

interest and other expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 the increase in interest and other expense for fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was primarily due to interest of 31 million payable on senior unsecured notes issued in fiscal 2011 and to fees of 8 million associated with a bridge loan facility that was entered into and terminated during fiscal 2011 interest and other expense for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 remained essentially flat 

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net for the past three fiscal years was as follows 

 

   

the increase in interest and other income in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in gains realized on sale of investment securities the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 

income taxes 

income tax expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 the tax rate for fiscal 2011 was lower than the rate for the fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in income in jurisdictions outside the us with lower tax rates and a favorable us internal revenue service audit settlement the tax rate for fiscal 2011 further benefited from tax incentives offered in several jurisdictions and from the december 2010 reinstatement of the us rd tax credit retroactive to its prior expiration in december 2009 the change in the fiscal 2010 tax rate from the fiscal 2009 rate was principally attributable to the income before taxes for fiscal 2010 as opposed to the net loss before taxes incurred in fiscal 2009 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 did not include the impact of the us rd tax credit from the time it expired in december 2009 applied’s effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation and the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income 

segment information

 in fiscal 2011 customers in china accounted for 47 percent of total net sales for the display segment compared to 18 percent in fiscal 2010 and 11 percent in fiscal 2009 customers in taiwan accounted for 31 percent of total net sales for the segment in fiscal 2011 compared to 35 percent in fiscal 2010 and 33 percent in fiscal 2009 customers in korea accounted for 16 percent of total net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2011 compared to 37 percent in fiscal 2010 and 29 percent in fiscal 2009 

  

  

fiscal 2011 operating financial results reflected a cyclical downturn in demand for equipment to manufacture lcd products that resulted in an extremely low level of orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 new orders were 20 million a decrease of 91 percent compared to the prior quarter for fiscal 2011 new orders decreased by 163 million to 636 million compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease in new orders reflected customers’ decisions to delay investment in new lcd tv capacity which was partially offset by increased demand for ltps and touch panel systems although this demand also softened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as an initial buildout of manufacturing capacity was absorbed net sales decreased by 200 million to 699 million for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease in net sales reflected a decline in spending for lcd tv products as customers delayed their investments including plans for manufacturing in china partially offset by increased demand for equipment to manufacture new mobile devices like smart phones and tablets the book to bill ratio remained flat at 09 for fiscal 2011 operating income decreased by 120 million to 147 million for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease in operating income for fiscal 2011 reflected an unfavorable product mix three customers accounted for 54 percent of net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2011 the decrease in operating margin in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to changes in product mix in 2011 the company introduced the applied akt20k px pecvd system for manufacturing highperformance oled and lcd displays and the applied aktaristotwin system for manufacturing touchenabled displays 

fiscal 2010 operating financial results reflected increased demand for lcd equipment over fiscal 2009 due to improved global economic and industry conditions new orders increased by 512 million to 799 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in new orders reflected the general recovery in the lcd market as customers increased production levels in response to strong enddemand for flat panel tvs and notebook computers net sales increased by 397 million to 899 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in net sales reflected strong market demand for lcd products five customers accounted for 71 percent of net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2010 the book to bill ratio increased to 09 for fiscal 2010 reflecting increased demand compared to 06 for fiscal 2009 operating income increased by 216 million to 267 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in operating income was due to a significant increase in net sales and improved gross margin driven by an increase in volume 

fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for lcd equipment due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions new orders decreased significantly to 287 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 15 billion in fiscal 2008 which reflected the slowdown in the display industry from fiscal 2008 when display manufacturers added capacity net sales decreased by 474 million to 502 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of significantly lower orders operating income decreased to 51 million in fiscal 2009 from 301 million in fiscal 2008 operating income decreased due to significantly lower revenue partially offset by lower operating expenses due to cost control initiatives the book to bill ratio decreased to 06 for fiscal 2009 reflecting significantly decreased demand compared to 15 for fiscal 2008 

energy and environmental solutions segment 

the energy and environmental solutions segment includes products for fabricating c–si solar pvs high throughput rolltoroll coating systems for flexible electronics and web products this business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy with an emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar power by providing equipment to enhance manufacturing scale and efficiency until the first quarter of fiscal 2011 the energy and environmental solutions segment included the fullyintegrated sunfab production line for manufacturing thin film solar panels during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 applied announced a plan to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment in response to adverse market conditions for thin film solar and as a result applied discontinued sales of sunfab lines to new customers but is offering individual tools for thin film solar manufacturing applied is supporting existing sunfab line customers with services upgrades and capacity increases through its applied global services segment and effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 applied accounts for these products under its applied global services segment 

  

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years 

 

 in fiscal 2011 customers in china accounted for 80 percent of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment compared to 63 percent in fiscal 2010 and 38 percent in fiscal 2009 customers in europe accounted for 3 percent of total net sales for the segment in fiscal 2011 compared to 25 percent in fiscal 2010 and 39 percent in fiscal 2009 

fiscal 2011 financial results reflected increased demand for csi products in the first half of the year which rapidly declined in the second half of fiscal 2011 due to excess manufacturing capacity and customers’ decreased access to capital in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 new orders were 86 million a decrease of 73 percent compared to the prior quarter for fiscal 2011 new orders increased by 176 million to 17 billion compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in new orders for fiscal 2011 reflected significantly increased demand for csi equipment particularly wafering and metallization products the increased demand was partially driven by government incentives for solar net sales increased by 509 million to 20 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in net sales for fiscal 2011 primarily reflected higher sales to csi customers net sales in fiscal 2010 included 539 million from sales of sunfab thin film lines there were no sales of sunfab thin film lines recognized in the energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2011 customers in china accounted for an increased proportion of the energy and environment solutions segment’s results compared to prior years including 78 percent of new orders the book to bill ratio decreased to 08 for fiscal 2011 compared to 10 for fiscal 2010 the decrease for fiscal 2011 reflected a higher increase in net sales yearoveryear relative to demand the energy and environmental solutions segment reported operating income of 453 million for fiscal 2011 compared to an operating loss of 466 million for fiscal 2010 operating loss for fiscal 2010 included charges totaling 486 million associated with the energy and environmental solutions restructuring plan announced in july 2010 the increase in operating income for fiscal 2011 was also attributable to significantly higher net sales of csi equipment and included favorable adjustments of 36 million related to the restructuring program announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 the increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 was due to higher manufacturing volume for csi equipment in 2011 the applied baccini pegaso platform for nextgeneration solar cell manufacturing was introduced 

in fiscal 2010 applied incurred charges of 486 million that included a plan to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment as described above consisting of inventoryrelated charges of 330 million related to sunfab thin film solar equipment asset impairment charges of 108 million employee severance charges of 45 million and other costs of 3 million 

fiscal 2010 financial results compared to fiscal 2009 reflected increased demand for csi products offset by reduced demand for sunfab thin film solar manufacturing lines due to the challenging market conditions for utilityscale solar new orders increased by 553 million to 15 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in orders reflected increased demand for csi products particularly wafering and metallization products offset by reduced demand for sunfab lines net sales increased by 326 million to 15 billion for 

  

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 net sales for fiscal 2010 primarily reflected higher sales to csi customers than in fiscal 2009 the relative share of the segment’s net sales attributable to sunfab customers decreased to 36 percent in fiscal 2010 from 44 percent in fiscal 2009 for fiscal 2010 customers in china and europe accounted for 88 percent of total net sales in this segment the book to bill ratio increased to 10 for fiscal 2010 compared to 08 for fiscal 2009 the operating loss in the energy and environmental solutions segment increased by 232 million to 466 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in operating loss was primarily due to restructuring asset impairment and inventoryrelated charges of 486 million recognized in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010 and lower net sales to sunfab customers partially offset by increased sales of csi products and cost control initiatives results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 reflected customer final acceptance of two sunfab lines 

fiscal 2009 financial results reflected reduced demand for csi products over fiscal 2008 offset in part by higher demand for sunfab lines new orders of 955 million in fiscal 2009 decreased from 13 billion in fiscal 2008 the decrease in new orders was primarily due to decreased demand from csi customers and reflected the challenging global economic environment solar manufacturers’ difficulties in obtaining costeffective capital and a decrease in end demand net sales of 12 billion in fiscal 2009 increased from 819 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in sales for sunfab lines the operating loss of 234 million in fiscal 2009 increased from 206 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in rde expenses and unfavorable gross margins associated with initial sunfab line startups offset in part by cost control initiatives the book to bill ratio decreased to 08 for fiscal 2009 reflecting significantly decreased demand compared to 16 for fiscal 2008 in 2009 applied introduced its baccini esatto technology a high precision multistep printing capability designed to increase the efficiency of csi solar cells

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 30 2011 

 

  

 

 in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above the company has certain tax obligations gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of october 30 2011 the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 59 million exclusive of interest and penalties increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were 1 million as of october 30 2011 and 6 million as of october 31 2010 all 1 million in interest and penalties is classified as longterm payable in the consolidated balance sheets at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and accordingly such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered seller’s price to buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements in addition applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units moreover judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

in 2009 the financial accounting standards board issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and certain software sold with tangible products this guidance eliminated the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of management’s best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific evidence or third party evidence is unavailable applied implemented this guidance prospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for transactions that were initiated or materially modified during fiscal 2010 the implementation of the new guidance had an insignificant impact on reported net sales compared to net sales under previous guidance as the new guidance did not change the units of accounting within sales arrangements and the elimination of the residual method for the allocation of arrangement consideration had an inconsequential impact on the amount and timing of reported net sales 

warranty costs 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty 

  

support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied’s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowance 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

nongaap results 

management uses nongaap results to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes applied believes these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods the nongaap results presented below exclude the impact of the following where applicable restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustment related to restructuring actions certain discrete tax items certain acquisitionrelated costs investment impairments and gain or loss on sale of facilities these nongaap measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from nongaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap 

nongaap operating income for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were 24 billion and 17 billion respectively nongaap operating loss for fiscal 2009 was 142 million 

nongaap net income for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were 17 billion or 130 per share and 12 billion or 088 per share respectively nongaap net loss for fiscal 2009 was 69 million or 005 per share

silicon systems group segment 

 

applied’s silicon systems group segment develops manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips also referred to as integrated circuits ics most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components such as transistors and other devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring interconnects applied offers systems that perform most of the primary processes used in chip fabrication including atomic layer deposition ald chemical vapor deposition cvd physical vapor deposition pvd electrochemical deposition ecd etch rapid thermal processing rtp chemical mechanical planarization cmp wet cleaning and wafer metrology and inspection as well as systems that etch measure and inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build and package memory logic and other types of chips 

 

most chips currently are fabricated using 65 nanometer nm and larger linewidth dimensions although applied is also working with customers on leadingedge technology for advanced nodes using 45nm 32nm and smaller dimensions to build a chip the transistors capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove portions of successive film layers similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer as the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing capability in the same or smaller physical area the complexity of building the chip also increases necessitating more process steps to form smaller structures and more intricate wiring schemes a typical simplified process sequence for building the wiring or interconnect portion of a chip involves initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a cvd system an etch system is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer to form the metal interconnects these openings and patterns are subsequently filled with conducting material using pvd and ecd technologies a cmp step then polishes the wafer to achieve a flat surface additional deposition etch and cmp steps are then performed to build up the layers needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements advanced chip designs require more than 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle 

 

while some device manufacturers are still using aluminum as the main conducting material for building interconnect structures most have transitioned to copper copper has lower resistance than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing copperbased chips including equipment for depositing etching and planarizing copper interconnect layers complementing the transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low dielectric constant low k films to replace silicon

marketing and sales 

 

net sales by geographic region which are attributed according to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells products worldwide through a direct sales force approximately 88 percent of applied’s fiscal 2010 net sales were to regions outside of the united states 

 

general economic conditions impact applied’s business and financial results from time to time the markets in which products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may negatively impact sales applied’s business is usually not seasonal in nature but it is highly cyclical based on capital equipment investment by major semiconductor flat panel display solar pv and other manufacturers customers’ expenditures depend on many factors including anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors lcds solar cells and modules and other substrates the development of new technologies customers’ factory utilization capital resources and financing and global and regional economic conditions 

 

applied manages its business and reports financial results based on the segments described above but does not allocate certain sales and marketing costs to the segments 

 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements the following companies accounted 

for at least 10 percent of applied’s net sales in 2010 2009 andor 2008 which were for products in multiple reportable segments 

 

 

 

 

  

competition 

 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity and costeffectiveness the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete with a single product andor in a single region to global diversified companies with a range of products applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde marketing and sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

 

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability and to a lesser extent by demand for commercial applications as a result products within the silicon systems group segment are subject to rapid changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technical approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a broad portfolio of technically differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry with some offering a single product line and others offering multiple product lines these competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies factors that influenced the competitive environment for the silicon systems group in fiscal 2010 included the rebound in the semiconductor industry driven by higher demand for pcs and cell phones as well as the introduction of tablet computers higher factory utilization rates and tight device supply led manufacturers to increase their wafer fab equipment wfe capital spending which is the major driver for silicon systems group net sales 

 

products and services within the applied global services segment are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to reduce costs improve productivity and lessen the environmental impact of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered customers with more significant operations andor expertise may require fewer service products than customers who place greater reliance on an outsourcing model industry conditions that affected applied global services’ sales of spares and services in fiscal 2010 were principally semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts as well as additions to the tool installed base 

 

products in the display segment are subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors applied holds established market positions with its technicallydifferentiated thin film technology tftlcd manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd and tft array testing although its market position could 

change quickly due to customers’ evolving requirements the competitive environment for applied’s display segment in fiscal 2010 was characterized by increased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions and growing global demand for touch screen devices 

 

applied’s products within the energy and environmental solutions segment compete in diverse market areas including equipment to make solar pv cells and modules all of these markets are driven by extreme pressure to reduce overall production costs and improve cell performance in this segment applied offers products primarily for csi waferbased applications applied competes with many other companies some of which have more experience with solar applications and some of which are just entering the solar equipment business 

 

patents and licenses 

 

management believes that applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon the company’s research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a substantial number of patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in the company’s best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied for the life of the patents applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in responding to such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

environmental matters 

 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental health or safety incidents including without limitation spills releases or possible contamination 

 

compliance with federal state and local environmental health and safety provisions including without limitation those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following factors could materially affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

 

the industries that applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict 

 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity and advanced technology requirements and spending which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization production volumes enduse demand and inventory levels relative to demand as well as the rate of technology transitions and customers’ access to affordable capital these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales operating expenses and net income 

 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied does not accurately forecast and timely and appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment applied’s business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with the difficult financial markets and uncertain global economy 

 

the tightening of the credit markets disruption in the financial markets and global economic recession that began in 2008 contributed to significant slowdowns in the industries in which applied operates although economic and market conditions have improved continuing difficulties in the financial markets and uncertainty regarding the global economic recovery are posing challenges the markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services which may reduce net sales reduce backlog and affect applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales difficulties in obtaining capital uncertain market conditions or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations leading to customers’ reduced research and development funding andor capital expenditures and in turn lower sales andor additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied these conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied’s products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify the risks that may affect its business sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities andor modify its business model which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio and return on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges if applied does not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain 

macroeconomic environment and industry conditions applied’s business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

 

the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries including 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes in the semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

 

the greatest portion of applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability historically has been derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the silicon systems group to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry in addition to the general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor including 

 

 16 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry 

 

the global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of lcd manufacturers and the concentrated nature of lcd enduse applications recently industry growth has depended to a considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs in addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry including 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry 

 

applied anticipates that an increasing portion of its business will be in the emerging solar market which in addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor is characterized by ongoing changes specific to the solar industry including 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes 

 

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment its future success depends on many factors including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment services and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including enhancing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates while constantly improving its operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more varied competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely costeffectively and successfully 

 

 18 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage these challenges its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

operating in multiple industries and the entry into new markets and industries entail additional challenges 

 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions the entry into different markets involves additional challenges including those arising from 

 

 19 

 

in addition applied has begun applying for and receiving funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its rd resources and address new market opportunities as a condition to this government funding applied may be subject to certain recordkeeping audit intellectual property rightssharing andor other obligations 

 

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from its diversification and entry into new markets and industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

 

in fiscal 2010 approximately 88 percent of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states certain of applied’s rd and manufacturing facilities as well as suppliers to applied are also located outside the united states including in singapore taiwan china korea israel italy and switzerland applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries the global nature of applied’s business and operations presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

 

  

many of these challenges are present in china and korea which are experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and competitors to applied applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets 

for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions in addition applied must regularly reassess the size capability and location of its global infrastructure and make appropriate changes and must have effective change management processes and procedures to address changes in its business and operations these challenges may materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

 

applied’s semiconductor and flat panel display customer bases historically have been and are becoming even more highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions for example in fiscal 2010 four semiconductor manufacturers accounted for 51 percent of silicon systems group net sales and five lcd manufacturers accounted for 71 percent of display net salescertain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes consolidated with other manufacturers outsourced manufacturing activities or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers in addition customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners also certain semiconductor and display customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments 

 

in this environment contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of semiconductor and display manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s business which may result in added complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

 

applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers and timely performance by contract manufacturers some key parts may be subject to long leadtimes andor obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the united states including china and korea cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital technical operational and other risks for companies throughout applied’s supply chain further the adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns in recent periods have caused and may continue to cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations potentially affecting applied’s ability to obtain quality parts on a timely basis applied may experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 

 21 

 

  

in addition applied’s need to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders applied may incur excess inventory charges any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments 

 

applied has made and in the future intends to make acquisitions of and investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 

 

  

applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the 

investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations if applied does not successfully manage the risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

 

applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions changes in applied’s management or leadership competitors’ hiring practices cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and the effectiveness of applied’s compensation and benefit programs including its sharebased programs applied periodically evaluates its overall compensation program and makes adjustments as appropriate to enhance its competitiveness if applied does not successfully attract retain and motivate key employees applied may be unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

 

the failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations 

 

to better align its costs with market conditions locate closer to customers enhance productivity and improve efficiencies applied conducts engineering software development manufacturing sourcing and other operations in regions outside the united states including india china and korea applied is implementing a more distributed manufacturing model which includes transitioning certain manufacturing and supply chain activities from the united states and europe to singapore taiwan and other countries in asia and completing assembly of some systems at the customer site in addition applied outsources certain functions to third parties including companies in the united states india china korea and other countries outsourced functions include contract manufacturing engineering customer support software development information technology support finance and administrative activities the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies assure quality and continuity of supply and protect applied’s intellectual property if applied does not accurately forecast the amount timing and mix of demand for products or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer particularly during a market upturn 

 

in addition applied is implementing a comprehensive program to better align its global organizations and processes including initiatives to enhance the asia supply chain integrate its sales teams into the business units and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing applied also is implementing a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions the implementation of additional functionality to the erp system entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt applied’s operations such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products project inventory requirements manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities negatively affect employee morale or have other unintended consequences 

 

if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties increased costs including energy and transportation manufacturing interruptions or delays inefficiencies in the structure andor operation of its supply chain loss of its intellectual property rights quality issues increased product 

timetomarket andor inefficient allocation of human resources any or all of which could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or longlived assets 

 

applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the review compares the fair value for each of applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value including goodwill factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows declines in the market price of applied common stock changes in the company’s strategies or product portfolio and restructuring activities applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance applied may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which could materially and adversely affect applied’s results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights 

 

applied from time to time is and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights antitrust environmental regulations securities contracts product performance product liability unfair competition misappropriation of trade secrets employment workplace safety and other matters applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties 

 

in february 2010 the seoul prosecutor’s office for the eastern district in korea indicted certain employees of applied materials korea amk including the former head of amk who at the time of indictment was a vice president of applied materials inc along with employees of several other companies alleging the improper receipt and use of the confidential information of samsung electronics co ltd samsung a major customer hearings on these matters are ongoing in the seoul eastern district court applied and samsung entered into a settlement agreement effective as of november 1 2010 which resolves potential civil claims related to this matter and which is separate from and does not affect the criminal proceedings 

 

legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may 1 be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct 2 divert management’s attention and other applied resources 3 inhibit applied’s ability to sell its products 4 result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines andor 5 negatively affect applied’s business there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings claims or investigations if applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle legal proceedings or claims or in the event of any adverse findings against applied or any of its employees applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and applied may suffer harm to its reputation 

 

applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights furthermore the laws and practices of other countries including china india taiwan and korea permit the protection and enforcement of applied’s rights to varying extents which may not be sufficient to protect applied’s rights applied previously entered into an arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future there can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with the arrangement if applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle claims obtain or enforce 

intellectual property rights obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and applied may suffer harm to its reputation see note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

changes in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations 

 

as a global company applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in the 1 applicable tax laws 2 amount and composition of pretax income in countries with differing tax rates or 3 valuation of applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

to better align with the increasingly international nature of its business applied is transitioning certain manufacturing supply chain and other operations into asia bringing these activities closer to customers these changes are expected to result in a reduction of future operating costs in singapore applied is pursuing available tax incentives that provide that certain income earned in singapore would be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates to obtain these tax benefits applied must meet requirements relating to various activities applied is engaged in discussions with tax authorities in singapore and the united states concerning these incentives applied’s ability to realize benefits from these initiatives could be materially affected if among other things applicable requirements are not met the incentives are substantially modified or if applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction 

 

in addition applied is subject to regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes which requires estimates and judgments although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates which may be timeconsuming and expensive there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals which could materially and adversely affect applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is subject to risks of noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations 

 

applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacture and use of its products recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products the operation of its facilities and the use of its real property the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations such as those related to climate change could result in 1 significant remediation liabilities 2 the imposition of fines 3 the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of its products 4 limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property andor 5 a decrease in the value of its real property each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment 

 

applied is subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations for example as a public company with global operations applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy and anticorruption changes in laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue 

generating activities to compliance activities if applied is found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws rules or regulations applied could be subject to legal or regulatory sanctions the public’s perception of applied could decline and applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

introduction 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied’s business and results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with applied’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10k mda consists of the following sections 

 

  

overview 

 

applied provides manufacturing equipment services and software to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar photovoltaic pv and related industries applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips flat panel liquid crystal displays lcds solar pv cells and modules and other electronic devices these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in north america europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

 

applied’s results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products each of applied’s businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips lcds solar pvs and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes after a challenging year in fiscal 2009 that was characterized by credit constraints in the financial markets a weak global economy and a semiconductor industry downturn global economic and industry conditions affecting applied’s businesses generally improved in fiscal 2010 except for conditions in the thin film solar pv market 

 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

financial results for fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 reflected significantly increased demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to more favorable global economic and industry conditions the increase in total orders from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increased demand for semiconductor display and crystalline silicon csi solar pv products partially offset by decreased demand for sunfab tm thin film solar lines net sales increased during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due primarily to higher sales of semiconductor and display equipment 

 

also in fiscal 2010 applied incurred charges totaling 84 million associated with a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce as of october 25 2009 by approximately 1000 positions over a period of 18 months in addition applied incurred charges totaling 486 million that included a plan to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment this action was in response to adverse market conditions for thin film solar including delays in utilityscale solar adoption solar panel manufacturers’ challenges in obtaining affordable capital changes and uncertainty in government renewable energy policies and competitive pressure from csi solar technologies as part of the restructuring applied discontinued sales to new customers of its fullyintegrated sunfab lines but continued to offer individual tools for thin film solar manufacturing applied is supporting existing sunfab customers with services upgrades and capacity increases through its applied global services segment and will continue rde efforts to improve thin film panel efficiency and highproductivity deposition 

 

fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions particularly in the first half of fiscal 2009 negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty led some customers to dramatically reduce factory operations and to reduce their spending in the second half of fiscal 2009 demand for semiconductor and display equipment increased but was still down significantly from fiscal 2008 levels fiscal 2009 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs 

 

fiscal 2008 financial results reflected decreased demand for semiconductor equipment and to a lesser extent service products due to unfavorable market conditions in the semiconductor industry partially offset by increased demand for lcd and solar products new orders decreased from fiscal 2007 due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory foundry and logic chip manufacturers partially offset by increased demand by lcd customers and beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the initial recognition of orders for applied’s sunfab thin film line for manufacturing solar panels net sales decreased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to the decline in investment from memory and logic customers partially offset by increased sales of csi solar manufacturing products net income decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower net sales offset in part by lower operating expenses fiscal 2008 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs 

results of operations 

 

the following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information 

 

 

 

applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 as a result of these conditions and the changing global economic environment there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales both within and across the three fiscal years demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip lcd and solar pv supply and demand and other factors including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes 

new orders 

 

new orders by geographic region which are attributed according to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

new orders more than doubled to 102 billion in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was principally due to greater demand for semiconductor equipment and services primarily from memory and foundry customers as well as increased demand for csi solar manufacturing products and display equipment the increase in new orders reflected the general recovery in the semiconductor equipment industry and the lcd market from the steep downturn experienced in fiscal 2009 

 

new orders decreased 55 percent to 41 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in new orders was across all segments and particularly in the semiconductor and display businesses reflecting the challenging economic and industry conditions prevalent during fiscal 2009 customer demand for semiconductor and lcd equipment began to recover in the second half of fiscal 2009 

 

new orders decreased 5 percent to 92 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from logic memory and foundry chip manufacturers partially offset by increased demand for lcd and solar equipment including the initial recognition of orders for the applied sunfab thin film line demand for lcd equipment slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as display customers absorbed capacity following robust demand over the preceding three quarters 

 

applied’s backlog as of the end of each of the last three fiscal years was as follows 32 billion at october 31 2010 27 billion at october 25 2009 and 48 billion at october 26 2008 backlog increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in new orders for silicon systems group and applied global services reflecting increased demand for semiconductor equipment backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months and 3 orders for sunfab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders in addition the majority of sales in the largest business segment were from orders received and shipped in the same quarter 

net sales 

 

net sales by geographic region which are attributed according to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

net sales of 95 billion for fiscal 2010 increased 90 percent from fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher sales of semiconductor equipment net sales decreased 38 percent to 50 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of significantly lower sales of equipment and services to semiconductor and display customers partially offset by increased sales of solar manufacturing equipment net sales decreased 16 percent to 81 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to decreased investment from memory and logic chip manufacturers partially offset by increased demand from solar and lcd customers 

 

gross margin 

 

 

 

the increase in the gross margin as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was principally attributable to higher net sales more favorable product mix improved factory utilization and continued cost control measures offset in part by inventoryrelated charges of 330 million associated with sunfab thin film solar equipment these inventoryrelated charges lowered gross margin for fiscal 2010 by approximately 3 percentage points the decrease in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due to lower net sales lowermargin product mix and reduced factory absorption offset in part by cost control initiatives gross margin during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 included 32 million 28 million and 32 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

 

research development and engineering 

 

 

 

applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and 

projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied historically has maintained its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies rde expenses were 11 billion 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2010 934 million 19 percent of net sales in fiscal 2009 and 11 billion 14 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 rde expense during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 included 43 million 50 million and 59 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

 

in fiscal 2010 applied developed new technology to enable nextgeneration 22nm and below chip designs these systems were designed to help customers continue their drive to pack more transistors in the same space using using highkmetal gate technologies and double patterning processes applied also developed technology for throughsilicon vias tsvs an emerging solution for interconnecting three dimensional chip stacks to provide better device performance lower power consumption and the integration of heterogeneous devices in the solar pv area applied continued the development of its precision wafering and cell manufacturing products for lowering the cost of producing solargenerated electricity through advanced crystalline silicon technology 

 

in fiscal 2009 applied focused on developing systems for semiconductor customers’ new chip designs with 32nm and below geometries including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and highkmetal gate technologies as well as double patterning processes that enable customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional technology generations applied also focused on developing technology for manufacturing next generation displays rde also included activities to develop products that enable lowercost production of solar energy and other products to enable energy conservation 

 

in fiscal 2008 applied focused on the development of processes and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices applied pioneered a selfaligned double patterning approach that can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional optical lithography the company also developed technology for the implementation of throughsilicon vias efforts were also focused on developing the systems and technology to reduce the costperwatt of solar electricity 

 

marketing selling general and administrative 

 

 

 

the increase in marketing selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 reflected the elimination of temporary salary reductions and shutdowns and the resumption of variable compensation programs the decrease in marketing selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to cost control initiatives marketing selling general and administrative expenses were 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2010 15 percent of net sales in fiscal 2009 and 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 marketing selling and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 included 51 million 69 million and 88 million respectively of sharebased compensation expense 

 

restructuring and asset impairments 

 

 

 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 applied announced a plan to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment the action which was expected to impact between 400 to 500 positions globally was in response to adverse market conditions for thin film solar including delays in utilityscale solar adoption solar panel 

manufacturers’ challenges in obtaining affordable capital changes and uncertainty in government renewable energy polices and competitive pressure from csi solar technologies during fiscal 2010 applied recorded charges related to this plan totaling 403 million which included inventoryrelated charges of 247 million related to sunfab thin film solar equipment asset impairment charges of 108 million employee severance charges of 45 million and other costs of 3 million 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 applied announced a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce as of october 25 2009 by approximately 1300 to 1500 positions or 10 to 12 percent over a period of 18 months during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 applied recorded restructuring charges of 104 million associated with this program during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of changes in business requirements applied revised its global workforce reduction to approximately 1000 positions and recorded a favorable adjustment of 20 million 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 applied announced a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1800 positions during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 applied expanded the scope of the restructuring program by approximately 200 positions during fiscal 2009 applied recorded restructuring charges of 143 million associated with this program the restructuring charges consisted of employeerelated costs to reduce the company’s workforce through a combination of attrition voluntary separation and other workforce reduction programs in addition applied determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets to be sold exceeded the estimated fair value and as a result recorded a 15 million impairment charge 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 applied announced a global cost reduction plan that primarily affected its silicon systems group and applied global services segments and related support organizations as part of this plan applied reduced its global workforce through a combination of job elimination and attrition for fiscal 2008 applied recorded restructuring charges of 29 million relating to this plan consisting primarily of employee related costs to reduce its workforce the affected employees were based in north america europe and asia and represented multiple functions 

 

for further details see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

net interest income 

 

 

 

the decrease in net interest income in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates the decrease in net interest income in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates the decrease in net interest income in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in investments and a decrease in interest rates offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities that occurred in september 2007 

 

income taxes 

 

 

 

the change in the fiscal 2010 tax rate from the fiscal 2009 rate was principally attributable to the income before taxes for fiscal 2010 as opposed to the net loss before taxes incurred in fiscal 2009 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 did not include the impact of the us rd tax credit from the time it expired in december 2009 in the event the us rd tax credit is enacted on a retroactive basis there would be a favorable impact to applied’s effective income tax rate in the period enacted the change in the fiscal 2009 tax rate from the fiscal 2008 rate was 

principally attributable to the net loss before taxes incurred in fiscal 2009 applied’s effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation and the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income 

 

segment information 

 

applied reports financial results in four segments silicon systems group applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 17 of notes to consolidated condensed financial statements applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level these unallocated costs include costs for sharebased compensation certain management finance legal human resources and rde functions provided at the corporate level and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy in addition applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions unless these charges or adjustments pertain to a specific reportable segment 

 

effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 applied changed its methodology for allocating certain expenses to its reportable segments such as components of variable compensation and operating expenses associated with the global sales organization applied has reclassified segment operating results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation 

 

the results for each reportable segment are discussed below 

 

silicon systems group segment

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties include those discussed in part ii item 1a “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies

applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered seller’s price to buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements in addition applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units moreover judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

in 2009 the financial accounting standards board issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and certain software sold with tangible products this new guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of management’s best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific evidence or third party evidence is unavailable applied implemented this guidance prospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for transactions that were initiated or materially modified during fiscal 2010 the implementation of the new guidance had an insignificant impact on reported net sales as compared to net sales under previous guidance as the new guidance did not change the units of accounting within sales arrangements and the elimination of the residual method for the allocation of arrangement consideration had an inconsequential impact on the amount and timing of reported net sales 

warranty costs 

 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

inventory valuation 

 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

goodwill and intangible assets 

 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in emerging markets a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a 

valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied’s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 

 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

applied’s investment portfolio includes fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 20 billion at october 31 2010 these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 31 2010 an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 25 million while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated condensed statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporary 

 

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen euro israeli shekel taiwanese dollar and swiss franc applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 24 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes net foreign currency gains and losses were not material for fiscal 2010

 item 1   business tableend  

incorporated in 1967 applied a delaware corporation provides nanomanufacturing technology tm solutions for the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries with a broad portfolio of innovative equipment service and software products “nanomanufacturing” is the production of ultrasmall structures including the engineering of thin films on substrates applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips flat panel liquid crystal displays lcds solar photovoltaic cells and modules solar pvs and other electronic devices who use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components the company’s fiscal year ends on the last sunday in october 

 

applied is the world’s largest semiconductor fabrication equipment supplier based on revenue with the capability to provide global deployment and support services applied also is the leading supplier of lcd fabrication equipment to the flat panel display industry and in 2009 applied was named by vlsi research as the leading supplier of solar pv manufacturing systems to the solar industry 

 

applied operates in four reportable segments silicon applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

silicon segment 

 

applied’s silicon systems group ssg reported under its silicon segment develops manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips also referred to as integrated circuits ics most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components such as transistors and other devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring interconnects applied offers systems that perform most of the primary processes used in chip fabrication including atomic layer deposition ald chemical vapor deposition cvd physical vapor deposition pvd etch rapid thermal processing rtp chemical mechanical planarization cmp and wafer metrology and inspection as well as systems that etch measure and inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by both integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build memory logic and other types of chips 

 

to build a chip the transistors capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove portions of successive film layers similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer as the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing capability in the same or smaller physical area the complexity of building the chip also increases necessitating more process steps to form smaller structures and more intricate wiring schemes a typical simplified process sequence for building the wiring or interconnect portion of a chip involves initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a cvd system an etch system is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer to form the metal interconnects these openings and patterns are subsequently filled with conducting material using pvd andor electroplating technologies a cmp step then polishes the wafer to achieve a flat surface additional deposition etch and cmp steps are then performed to build up the layers needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements advanced chip designs require more than 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle 

 

while some device manufacturers are still using aluminum as the main conducting material for building interconnect structures most have transitioned to copper copper has lower resistance than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing copperbased chips including equipment for depositing etching and planarizing copper interconnect layers complementing the transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low dielectric constant low k films to replace silicon 

dioxide material as the insulator between the copper wiring structures applied also leads the industry in providing systems for depositing low k dielectric films 

 

the transistor is another key area of the chip where semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs to enhance speed applied has the industry’s largest portfolio of technically advanced products for building smaller and faster transistors one method of enhancing chip performance is strain engineering a technique that stretches or compresses the space between atoms allowing electrical current to flow more quickly multiple strain films are typically used in advanced devices since they have an additive effect on increasing transistor speed applied has a comprehensive portfolio of systems to enable these applications using cvd and epitaxial deposition technologies 

 

most chips currently are fabricated using 65 nanometer nm and larger linewidth dimensions although applied is also working with customers on new technology for advanced nodes such as 45nm and below major chipmakers have announced that they will be integrating new high dielectric constant highk and metal materials and processes in their transistor gate structures to increase chip performance and reduce power consumption applied has a comprehensive portfolio of fully characterized processes for building these highkmetal gates these solutions include an integrated dielectric gate stack tool that combines four critical processes in a single system a portfolio of metallization technologies using ald and pvd and an innovative high temperature etch system 

 

another emerging area for applied’s technology is threedimensional 3d ics in which chips are vertically stacked to deliver higher performance and functionality in a smaller area the individual chips are electrically connected using deep holes called throughsilicon vias tsvs applied has the productionproven systems and processes required for the majority of tsv manufacturing steps including mask etch film deposition and cmp systems applied is leading efforts to enable the adoption of tsv technology working with consortiums and other equipment suppliers to lower the cost to customers for implementing tsv technology 

 

most of applied’s semiconductor equipment products are singlewafer systems with multiple process chambers attached to a base platform this enables each wafer to be processed separately in its own environment allowing precise process control while the system’s multiple chambers enable simultaneous high productivity manufacturing applied sells most of its singlewafer multichamber systems on four basic platforms the centura ®  the endura ®  the producer ® and the vantage ®  these platforms support ald cvd pvd etch and rtp technologies 

 

over time the semiconductor industry has migrated to increasingly larger wafers to build chips the predominant or common wafer size used today for volume production of advanced chips is 300 millimeter mm or 12inch wafers applied offers a comprehensive range of 300mm systems applied also offers earliergeneration 200mm systems as well as products and services to support all of its systems which are reported under its applied global services segment 

 

the following summarizes applied’s portfolio of products and their associated process technology areas reported under its silicon segment

applied’s backlog decreased from 48 billion at october 26 2008 to 27 billion at october 25 2009 applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2009 and totaled 12 billion consisting primarily of customer cancellations and financial debookings reflecting the decline in demand for semiconductor equipment delays in delivery schedules andor a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

 

applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of procurement assembly test and integration of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies collectively parts that are used to manufacture systems products in the silicon segment are manufactured in austin texas and rehovot israel remanufactured products in the applied global services segment are produced primarily in austin texas products in the display segment are manufactured in santa clara california alzenau germany and tainan taiwan products in the energy and environmental solutions segment are manufactured primarily in alzenau germany cheseaux switzerland treviso italy and santa clara california manufacturing requires raw materials including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components to be manufactured to applied’s specifications applied uses numerous companies including contract manufacturers to supply parts for the manufacture and support of its products although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of production and service interruptions as well as shortages of key parts by 1 selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts 2 monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers 3 maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts 4 qualifying new parts on a timely basis and 5 locating certain manufacturing operations in areas that are closer to suppliers and customers 

 

research development and engineering 

 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new products applied’s significant investment in research development and engineering rde has generally enabled it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology selection cycle applied works closely with its global 

customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in europe israel and china in addition applied outsources certain rde activities some of which are performed outside the united states process support and customer demonstration laboratories are located in the united states china europe and israel 

 

applied’s investments in rde for product development and engineering programs to create or improve products and technologies over the last three years were as follows 934 million 19 percent of net sales in fiscal 2009 11 billion 14 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 and 11 billion 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 applied has spent an average of 14 percent of net sales in rde over the last five years in addition to rde for specific product technologies applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems materials research and environmental control that are applicable to its products in fiscal 2009 applied focused on developing systems for semiconductor customers’ new chip designs with 32nm and below geometries including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and highkmetal gate technologies as well as double patterning processes that allows customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional technology generations applied also focused on developing technology for throughsilicon vias an emerging solution for interconnecting three dimensional chip stacks to provide better device performance lower power consumption and the integration of heterogeneous devices rde also included activities to develop products that enable lowercost production of solar energy and other products to enable energy conservation 

 

marketing and sales 

 

because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells products worldwide through a direct sales force approximately 81 percent of applied’s fiscal 2009 net sales were to regions outside of the united states net sales to customers by region as a percentage of total net sales were taiwan 21 percent north america primarily the united states 19 percent asiapacific including china 18 percent europe 15 percent japan 14 percent and korea 13 percent 

 

general economic conditions impact applied’s business and financial results from time to time the markets in which products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may negatively impact sales applied’s business is usually not seasonal in nature but it is cyclical based on capital equipment investment by major semiconductor flat panel display solar pv and other manufacturers these expenditures depend on many factors including anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors lcds solar cells and modules architectural glass and other substrates the development of new technologies customers’ factory utilization capital resources and financing and global and regional economic conditions 

 

applied manages its business and reports financial results based on the segments described above but does not allocate certain sales and marketing costs to the segments 

 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2009 intel corporation accounted for 12 percent of applied’s net sales samsung electronics co ltd accounted for 10 percent of applied’s net sales in fiscal 2009 16 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 and 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 these net sales were for products in multiple reportable segments 

 

competition 

 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity and costeffectiveness the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete with a single product andor in a single region to global diversified companies with a range of products applied’s ability to 

compete requires a high level of investment in rde marketing and sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

 

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability and to a lesser extent by demand for commercial applications as a result products within the silicon segment are subject to rapid changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technical approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a broad portfolio of technically differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively applied allocates resources among its many product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are many competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry with some offering a single product line and others offering multiple product lines these competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies 

 

products and services within the applied global services segment are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to reduce costs improve productivity and lessen the environmental impact of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered 

 

products in the display segment are subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors applied holds established market positions with its technically differentiated thin film technology tftlcd manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd and tft array testing although its market position could change quickly due to customers’ evolving requirements in fiscal 2007 applied entered the array pvd market with the aktpivot tm 55kv pvd system applied faces significant competition from existing array pvd suppliers 

 

applied’s products within the energy and environmental solutions segment compete in diverse market areas including equipment to make solar pv cells and modules flexible electronics and energyefficient glass in solar applied offers products for two distinct technologies csi waferbased and thin film glassbased applications as a recent entrant to the solar equipment business applied competes with many other companies that have more experience with solar applications applied also is a recent entrant to the flexible electronics equipment business which operates in an emerging market sector characterized by diverse types of applications customer requirements and competitors applied’s glass coating equipment faces significant competition from at least one established supplier and another recent market entrant 

 

patents and licenses 

 

management believes that applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon the company’s research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a substantial number of patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in the company’s best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied for the life of the patents applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in dealing with such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

environmental matters 

 

two of applied’s locations have been designated as environmental cleanup sites in 1987 the united states environmental protection agency designated one of the locations in santa clara california as a superfund site and named applied as a “responsible party” cleanup activities at this site began in 1984 and were substantially completed in february 2002 and present activities consist of annual sampling of wells the california regional water quality control board designated applied as a “discharger” with respect to another site in sunnyvale california applied was named a discharger upon its acquisition of the property in 1997 solely due to its status as property owner the prior owners of the site andor operators who caused the contamination are responsible for performing cleanup and monitoring activities 

 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance and periodically conducts investigations of possible contamination 

 

compliance with federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following factors could materially affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

 

the industries that applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict 

 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization production volumes enduse demand inventory levels relative to demand and access to affordable capital these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales operating expenses and net income 

 

to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves applied must effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments the challenging economic and industry conditions have adversely affected applied’s customers and led to a significant decrease in demand for many of applied’s products although indications of improving conditions are beginning to appear during periods of increasing demand for its products applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand effectively manage its supply chain attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals and continue to control costs during periods of decreasing demand applied must be able to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees if applied is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment applied’s business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with the difficult financial markets and weak global economy 

 

the tightening of the credit markets disruption in the financial markets and global economic downturn experienced over the last several quarters contributed to significant slowdowns in the industries in which applied operates which slowdowns may persist or worsen if these economic conditions are prolonged or deteriorate further the markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services which may reduce net sales reduce backlog and affect applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales difficulties in obtaining capital and uncertain market conditions may also lead to the inability of some customers to obtain affordable financing and to customer insolvencies resulting in lower sales andor additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied these conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied’s products in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect applied’s ability to compete effectively 

 

further these adverse conditions and uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions make it challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify the risks that may affect its business sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities andor modify its business model which may adversely affect applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks and that also includes some exposure to assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities the risks to applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated by deteriorating financial market conditions and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges if applied is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment and industry conditions applied’s business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

 

the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries including 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes in the semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

 

the greatest portion of applied’s revenues and profitability historically has been derived from sales of manufacturing equipment to the global semiconductor industry in addition a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry in addition to the general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor which may result in decreased spending by customers and negatively impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations the changes include 

 

 15 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry 

 

the global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of lcd manufacturers and the concentrated nature of lcd enduse applications recently industry growth has depended to a considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs in addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry including 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry 

 

applied anticipates that an increasing portion of its business will be in the emerging solar market which in addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor is characterized by ongoing changes specific to the solar industry including 

 

 16 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes 

 

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment its future success depends on many factors including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its nanomanufacturing technology equipment service and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including enhancing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates while constantly improving its operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more varied competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits applied’s success is subject to many risks including but not limited to its ability to timely costeffectively and successfully 

 

 17 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage these challenges its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

operating in multiple industries and the entry into new markets and industries entail additional challenges 

 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing nanomanufacturing technology products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions the entry into different markets involves additional challenges including those arising from 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from its diversification and entry into new markets and industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

 

in fiscal 2009 approximately 81 percent of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states certain of applied’s rd andor manufacturing facilities as well as suppliers to applied are also located outside the united states including in china applied is also expanding its business and operations in new 

countries the global nature of applied’s business and operations presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

 

  

many of these challenges are present in china which is experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and competitors to applied applied further believes that china presents a large potential market for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins than historically have been achieved in other regions in addition applied must regularly reassess the size capability and location of its global infrastructure and make appropriate changes and must have effective change management processes and procedures to address changes in its business and operations these challenges may materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

 

applied’s semiconductor and flat panel display customer bases historically have been and are becoming even more highly concentrated as a result of industry conditions these conditions are also adversely affecting customers’ profitability and access to capital which leads to lower rd funding and capital expenditures in addition certain customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners in the solar area while the number of solar pv manufacturing customers increases as the number of market entrants grows the size of contracts with particular customers is expected to rise substantially as the industry moves to greater solar module 

factory output capacity the ongoing adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns have caused and may continue to cause some customers to postpone delivery reduce or cancel orders exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations in this environment contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of semiconductor display and solar manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s business in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or they substantially reduce delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied in addition certain customers have undergone significant ownership andor management changes outsourced manufacturing activities engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other customers or consolidated with other customers each of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions as well as cancelled or decreased orders and lower net sales these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments 

 

applied has made and in the future intends to make acquisitions of and investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 

 

  

applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires 

ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners the risks to applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations if applied does not successfully manage the risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

 

applied’s business depends on its ability to timely supply equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers some key parts may be subject to long leadtimes andor obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the united states including china further the ongoing adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns have caused and may continue to cause some suppliers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other companies or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations potentially affecting applied’s ability to obtain parts applied may experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 

  

in addition applied’s need to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts the volatility of demand for capital equipment increases capital technical and other risks for companies in the supply chain any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the failure to successfully implement and conduct offshoring and outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations 

 

to better align its costs with market conditions increase its presence in growing markets enhance productivity and improve efficiencies applied conducts engineering software development and other operations in regions outside the united states particularly india and china and outsources certain functions to third parties including companies in the united states india china and other countries outsourced functions include certain engineering manufacturing customer support software development information technology support finance and administrative activities the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies assure quality and continuity of supply and protect applied’s intellectual property in addition applied has implemented several key operational initiatives intended to improve manufacturing efficiency including 

integratetoorder modulefinaltest and mergeintransit programs applied also is implementing a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions the implementation of additional functionality to the erp system entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt applied’s operations such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products project inventory requirements manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities negatively affect employee morale or have other unintended consequences 

 

if applied does not effectively develop and implement its offshoring and outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing a new erp system or enhancing business processes applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties increased costs including energy and transportation manufacturing interruptions or delays inefficiencies in the structure andor operation of its supply chain loss of its intellectual property rights quality issues increased product timetomarket andor inefficient allocation of human resources any or all of which could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations

introduction 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied’s business and results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with applied’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10k mda consists of the following sections 

 

  

overview 

 

applied provides nanomanufacturing technology tm solutions for the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries with a broad portfolio of innovative equipment service and software products applied’s customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors flat panel liquid crystal displays lcds solar photovoltaic cells and modules solar pvs flexible electronics and energyefficient glass applied operates in four reportable segments silicon applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in north america europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

 

applied’s results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products each of applied’s businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips lcds solar pvs and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes credit constraints in the financial markets and the weak global economy are compounding the impact of the highly cyclical markets in which applied operates 

 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions particularly in the first half of fiscal 2009 negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty led some customers to dramatically reduce factory operations and to reduce their spending in the second half of fiscal 2009 demand for semiconductor and display equipment increased but was still down significantly from fiscal 2008 levels fiscal 2009 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs while applied achieved profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 a meaningful improvement in the equipment sector for fiscal 2010 will depend on a recovery 

in customers’ end markets sufficient to support factories running at higher utilization and to encourage customers’ investments in new capacity as well as advanced technologies applied currently expects a recovery in fiscal 2010 particularly in the market for semiconductor capital equipment and anticipates that total net sales will increase more than 30 percent in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

fiscal 2008 financial results reflected decreased demand for semiconductor equipment and to a lesser extent service products due to unfavorable market conditions in the semiconductor industry partially offset by increased demand for lcd and solar products new orders decreased from fiscal 2007 due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory foundry and logic chip manufacturers partially offset by increased demand by lcd customers and beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the recognition of orders for applied’s sunfab tm thin film line for manufacturing solar panels net sales decreased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to the decline in investment from memory and logic customers partially offset by increased sales of crystalline silicon csi solar manufacturing products net income decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower net sales offset in part by lower operating expenses fiscal 2008 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs 

 

fiscal 2007 financial results reflected improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industry’s recovery in 2006 while conditions in the display industry were mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite strong consumer demand for lcd tvs total orders decreased slightly from fiscal 2006 primarily due to the significant decline in demand for display manufacturing products partially offset by increased demand for products and services in all other segments net sales in fiscal 2007 reflected strong demand from dynamic random access memory dram and flash memory chip manufacturers partially offset by a significant decline in lcd equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed capacity following substantial investment in 2006 improved net income in fiscal 2007 reflected higher sales and lower operating expenses offset in part by lower interest income fiscal 2007 financial results included restructuring and asset impairment and other charges associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products and an inprocess research and development iprd expense associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of brooks automation inc brooks software 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information 

 

 

applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 as a result of these conditions and the global economic environment there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales both within and across the fiscal years demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip lcd and solar pv supply and demand and other factors including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes in response to the challenging economic environment in fiscal 2009 applied implemented certain temporary cost reduction programs such as companywide shutdowns 

 

new orders 

 

new orders by geographic region which are attributed according to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

new orders decreased 55 percent to 41 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in new orders was across all segments and particularly in the semiconductor and display businesses reflecting the challenging economic and industry conditions prevalent during fiscal 2009 customer demand for semiconductor and lcd equipment began to recover in the second half of fiscal 2009 

 

new orders decreased 5 percent to 92 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from logic memory and foundry chip manufacturers partially offset by increased demand for lcd and solar equipment including the initial recognition of orders for the applied sunfab thin film line demand for lcd equipment slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as display customers absorbed capacity following robust demand over the preceding three quarters 

 

new orders for fiscal 2007 decreased 2 percent to 97 billion from 99 billion in the prior year reflecting delays in investment by lcd customers partially offset by increased demand for solar equipment semiconductor equipment and service products demand for semiconductor equipment slowed in the second half of fiscal 2007 as customers absorbed added capacity while demand from lcd customers recovered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 

 

applied’s backlog as of the end of each of the last three fiscal years was as follows 27 billion at october 25 2009 48 billion at october 26 2008 and 37 billion at october 28 2007 backlog decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to customer cancellations and financial debookings which totaled 12 billion reflecting the decline in demand for semiconductor equipment backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months and 3 orders for sunfab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods 

net sales 

 

net sales by geographic region which are attributed according to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

net sales decreased 38 percent to 50 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of significantly lower sales of equipment and services to semiconductor and display customers partially offset by increased sales of solar manufacturing equipment net sales decreased 16 percent to 81 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to decreased investment from memory and logic chip manufacturers partially offset by increased demand from solar and lcd customers during fiscal 2007 net sales increased by 6 percent to 97 billion from 92 billion in fiscal 2006 led by strength in memory capacity expansion throughout the year 

 

gross margin 

 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 285 percent in fiscal 2009 from 424 percent in fiscal 2008 compared to 461 percent in fiscal 2007 the decrease in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due to lower net sales lowermargin product mix and reduced factory absorption offset in part by cost control initiatives the decrease in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was attributable to lower net sales and lower margin product mix gross margin during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 included 28 million 32 million and 27 million respectively of equitybased compensation expense 

 

research development and engineering 

 

applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied historically has maintained its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies rde expenses were 934 million 19 percent of net sales in fiscal 2009 11 billion 14 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 and 11 billion 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 rde expense during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 included 50 million 59 million and 56 million respectively of equitybased compensation expense development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

 

in fiscal 2009 applied focused on developing systems for semiconductor customers’ new chip designs with 32nm and below geometries including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and highkmetal gate technologies as well as double patterning processes that enable customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional technology generations applied also focused on developing 

technology for manufacturing next generation displays rde also included activities to develop products that enable lowercost production of solar energy and other products to enable energy conservation 

 

in fiscal 2008 applied focused on the development of processes and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices applied pioneered a selfaligned double patterning approach that can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional optical lithography the company also developed technology for the implementation of throughsilicon vias efforts were also focused on developing the systems and technology to reduce the costperwatt of solar electricity 

 

in fiscal 2007 applied focused on developing systems for customers’ new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and highkmetal gate technologies and patterning processes to enable customers to extend their existing 193 nm lithography tools through additional technology generations applied also continued to invest in solar research and development 

 

there were no iprd charges recorded in either fiscal 2009 or 2008 during fiscal 2007 applied recorded an iprd expense of 5 million associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of brooks software a division of brooks automation inc applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchased acquisitions to iprd was determined through established valuation techniques the iprd was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 

 

marketing selling general and administrative 

 

marketing selling general and administrative expenses were 735 million 15 percent of net sales in fiscal 2009 965 million 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 and 952 million 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 the decrease in marketing selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to cost control initiatives the increase in marketing selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was principally attributable to increased operating costs from business acquisitions and equity compensation expenses offset in part by cost control initiatives marketing selling and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 included 69 million 88 million and 77 million respectively of equitybased compensation expense 

 

restructuring and asset impairments 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 applied announced a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1800 positions during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 applied expanded the scope of the restructuring program by approximately 200 positions during fiscal 2009 applied recorded restructuring charges of 143 million associated with this program the restructuring charges consisted of employee related costs to reduce the company’s workforce through a combination of attrition voluntary separation and other workforce reduction programs during fiscal 2009 applied also determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets to be sold exceeded the estimated fair value and as a result recorded a 15 million impairment charge 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 applied announced a global cost reduction plan that primarily affected its silicon and applied global services segments and related support organizations as part of this plan applied reduced its global workforce through a combination of job elimination and attrition for fiscal 2008 applied recorded restructuring charges of 29 million relating to this plan consisting primarily of employee related costs to reduce its workforce the affected employees were based in north america europe and asia and represented multiple functions 

 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 applied announced a plan the implant plan to cease development of beamline implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the operations of its implant group based in horsham england under the implant plan applied closed its research development and manufacturing operations in horsham in october 2007 restructuring charges under the implant plan for fiscal 2008 totaled 11 million and were associated with facilities restructuring and asset impairment charges under the implant plan in fiscal 2007 aggregated 30 million and consisted of 21 million in restructuring charges primarily associated with employee related costs and 9 million in asset impairments the majority of the affected employees were based in horsham england and represented multiple functions costs associated with the implant plan in fiscal 2007 also 

included inventoryrelated charges reported as cost of products sold of 56 million and other operating expenses of 10 million the implant group operated in the silicon segment and the results of its operations were not material to applied’s financial position or results of operations 

 

for further details see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

net interest income 

 

net interest income was 27 million for fiscal 2009 89 million for fiscal 2008 and 98 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease in net interest and other income in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates the decrease in net interest and other income in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in investments and a decrease in interest rates offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities that occurred in september 2007 

 

income taxes 

 

applied’s effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 was a benefit of 372 percent as compared to a provision of 318 percent for fiscal 2008 and a provision of 299 percent for fiscal 2007 the change in the fiscal 2009 tax rate from the fiscal 2008 rate was principally attributable to the net loss before taxes incurred in fiscal 2009 applied’s effective tax rate was higher for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as fiscal 2007 reflected a benefit of 36 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income tax filings partially offset by a 13 million charge from the expensing of equitybased compensation 

 

applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income and nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly 

 

segment information 

 

applied operates in four reportable segments silicon applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses which it manages separately at the corporate level these unallocated costs include those for equitybased compensation and certain components of variable compensation corporate marketing and sales corporate functions certain management finance legal human resources and rde and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy 

 

discussions below include the results of each reportable segment 

 

silicon segment 

 

the silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition etch rapid thermal processing rtp chemical mechanical planarization cmp and metrology and inspection development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key technical challenges including transistor performance and nanoscale patterning and on improving chip manufacturing productivity to reduce costs 

 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 

 

fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions silicon new orders decreased 59 percent to 17 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in new orders reflected significantly lower demand primarily from memory and logic customers net sales decreased 51 percent to 20 billion in fiscal 2009 

compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in net sales was due to decreased capital investments primarily by memory customers operating income decreased 88 percent to 152 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in operating income was due to significantly lower sales resulting in lower factory absorption partially offset by lower operating expenses from cost control initiatives operating income for fiscal 2009 also reflected an increase in bad debt expense after an operating loss in the first half of fiscal 2009 the silicon segment returned to operating profitability during the second half of the year which was primarily driven by sales to foundry customers during the year the company introduced a new platform specifically designed for underbump metallization ubm and other backend processes the applied charger ubm pvd system 

 

fiscal 2008 silicon new orders decreased 38 percent to 41 billion compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease in new orders was due to reduced demand for equipment from logic memory and foundry customers net sales decreased 38 percent to 40 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease in net sales was due to decreased investment by logic and memory customers operating income decreased 48 percent to 12 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease in operating income was due to significantly lower revenue levels from the slowdown in the semiconductor equipment industry partially offset by lower operating expenses attributable to continued focus on cost controls and improvement in manufacturing activities in fiscal 2008 the company launched two key products for photomask applications the applied aera2 mask inspection system which detects critical defects on a photomask and the applied tetra reticle clean system which cleans 32nm and below photomasks using wet clean chemistry the company also introduced the applied producer eharp system for depositing films in high aspect ratio device structures 

 

silicon orders in fiscal 2007 reflected the semiconductor industry’s strength during this period driven by demand for cell phones computers digital tvs game consoles mp3 players and other electronic products the majority of new orders were for memory applications as customers invested in leadingedge flash and dram memory devices while orders from foundries remained at low levels net sales reflected increased investment by memory and logic semiconductor customers in multiple areas including etch inspection and rtp products operating income reflected higher revenue levels and continued focus on cost controls operating income for fiscal 2007 included charges of 66 million related to ceasing development of beamline implant products in fiscal 2007 the company launched the applied producer gt for chemical vapor deposition processing for 45 nm and beyond applications applied also announced its portfolio of highkmetal gate solutions including the applied advanced gate stack and applied centura carina etch systems other new etch systems introduced were the applied mariana trench for etching high aspect ratio structures the applied opus advantedge metal etch with a new 5chamber platform and the applied centura tetra iii advanced reticle etch the company also added to its line of lithographyenabling systems with the new applied producer ace sacvd and added to its line of strain engineering solutions with the applied producer celera cvd 

 

applied global services segment 

 

the applied global services segment encompasses technically differentiated products including spares services certain earlier generation equipment products and remanufactured equipment to improve operating efficiency reduce operating costs and lessen the environmental impact of semiconductor display and solar customers’ factories customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites 

 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 

 

fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions as well as a significant reduction in the installed base of 200mm systems new orders decreased 48 percent to 12 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due primarily to decreased demand for spares and refurbished equipment arising from semiconductor manufacturers’ 

low wafer production volumes net sales decreased 40 percent to 14 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 reflecting lower sales of spares and refurbished equipment operating income decreased 80 percent to 113 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of lower sales volumes which led to lower infrastructure cost absorption partially offset by lower operating expenses from cost control initiatives operating income for fiscal 2009 also included an increase in bad debt expense in the second half of fiscal 2009 the applied global services segment returned to operating profitability as sales of spares improved 

 

fiscal 2008 results were impacted by lower levels of semiconductor and display customers’ factory utilization new orders decreased 10 percent to 22 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower orders for spares fabwide services and refurbished equipment partially offset by increased orders for service and system enhancements net sales decreased 1 percent to 23 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the net sales decrease reflected lower sales of fabwide services and spares offset by increased sales in services and system enhancements operating income decreased 9 percent to 575 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to higher operating expenses in fiscal 2008 

 

new orders in fiscal 2007 reflected increased demand for spare parts and services as well as demand for factory automation products obtained as part of the brooks software acquisition net sales in fiscal 2007 reflected increases in factory automation sales offset by declines in spares sales fiscal 2007 remanufactured equipment orders and net sales remained consistent with fiscal 2006 levels operating income compared to fiscal 2006 reflected changes in product mix and increased operating expenses and charges related to the brooks software acquisition

fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for lcd equipment due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions new orders decreased significantly to 287 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 15 billion in fiscal 2008 which reflected the slowdown in the display industry from fiscal 2008 when display manufacturers added capacity net sales decreased 49 percent to 502 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of significantly lower orders operating income decreased to 65 million in fiscal 2009 from 310 million in fiscal 2008 operating income decreased due to significantly lower revenue partially offset by lower operating expenses due to cost control initiatives 

 

in fiscal 2008 new orders increased significantly to 15 billion compared to 273 million in fiscal 2007 increased orders were due to substantial increases in demand by display customers in response to strong endproduct demand this demand for lcd equipment reached an inflection point in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 reflecting the volatility of the display industry net sales increased 38 percent to 976 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to customers’ investment in gen8 products operating income increased to 310 million in fiscal 2008 from 159 million in fiscal 2007 operating income increased due to higher revenue levels product mix and lower operating costs in fiscal 2008 the company introduced its gen10 systems that can process substrates sized at approximately 285 x 305 meters these systems include the akt90k pecvd and akt90k ebt products 

 

new orders for fiscal 2007 reflected delays in capacity expansion plans by lcd panel makers in light of excess inventories and end product sales price declines display customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter 

of fiscal 2007 as panel makers began to experience more favorable market conditions net sales reflected lower investment by lcd manufacturers as they absorbed capacity operating income reflected lower revenues and factory absorption product mix and higher operating expenses in support of the expanded product portfolio resulting from the acquisition of applied films in july 2006 in 2007 applied launched the aktpivot tm 55kv system which employs highproductivity costefficient pvd technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide films on the substrate

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and 

reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies 

 

warranty costs 

 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments this allowance is based on historical experience credit evaluations specific customer collection history and any customerspecific issues applied has identified changes in circumstances such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

inventory valuation 

 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

goodwill and intangible assets 

 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value the fair value of a 

reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment especially in new emerging markets a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied’s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 

 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition

at october 25 2009 applied’s investment portfolio included fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 26 billion applied’s primary objective for investing in fixedincome securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 25 2009 an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 21 million while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the investment is determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired 

 

all of applied’s debt bears interest at fixed rates therefore an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen euro israeli shekel and swiss francs applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within 24 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

 

forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen euro israeli shekel and swiss francs and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions applied’s outstanding forward exchange contracts are markedtomarket as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged therefore the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying 

transactions the effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations applied’s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option premiums paid for options outstanding at october 25 2009 were not material for further details see note 3 and note 9 of notes to consolidated condensed financial statements

applied is the world’s largest semiconductor fabrication equipment supplier based on revenue with the capability to provide global deployment and support services applied also is a global leader in lcd fabrication equipment and is a leading supplier of solar pv manufacturing solutions to the emerging solar industry 

 

applied operates in four reportable segments silicon applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors that could affect applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

silicon segment 

 

applied’s silicon systems group ssg reported under its silicon segment develops manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips also referred to as integrated circuits ics most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components such as transistors and other devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring interconnects applied offers systems that perform most of the primary processes used in chip fabrication including atomic layer deposition ald chemical vapor deposition cvd physical vapor deposition pvd etch rapid thermal processing rtp chemical mechanical planarization cmp and wafer metrology and inspection as well as systems that etch clean measure and inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by both integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build memory logic and other types of chips 

 

to build a chip the transistors capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove portions of successive film layers similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer as the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing capability in the same or smaller area the complexity of building the chip also increases necessitating more process steps to form smaller structures and more intricate wiring schemes a typical simplified process sequence for building the wiring or interconnect portion of a chip involves initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a cvd system an etch system is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer to form the metal interconnects these openings and patterns are subsequently filled with conducting material using pvd andor electroplating technologies a cmp step then polishes the wafer to achieve a flat surface additional deposition etch and cmp steps are then performed to build up the layers needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements advanced chip designs require about 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle 

 

while some device manufacturers are still using aluminum as the main conducting material for building interconnect structures most have transitioned to copper copper has lower resistance than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing copperbased chips including equipment for depositing etching and planarizing copper interconnect layers complementing the transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low dielectric constant low k films to replace silicon dioxide material as the insulator between the copper wiring structures applied also leads the industry in providing systems for depositing low k dielectric films 

the transistor is another key area of the chip where semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs to enhance speed applied has the industry’s largest portfolio of technically advanced products for building smaller and faster transistors one example is strain engineering a technique that stretches or compresses the space between atoms allowing electrical current to flow more quickly thus greatly enhancing chip performance multiple strain films are typically used in advanced devices since they have an additive effect on increasing transistor speed applied has a comprehensive portfolio of systems to enable these applications using cvd and epitaxial deposition technologies 

 

most chips currently are fabricated using 65 nanometer nm and larger linewidth dimensions although applied is also working with customers on more advanced nodes major chipmakers have announced that they will be integrating new high dielectric constant highk and metal materials and processes in their transistor gate structures to increase chip performance and reduce power consumption applied has a comprehensive portfolio of fully characterized processes for building these highkmetal gates these solutions include an integrated dielectric gate stack tool that combines four critical processes in a single system a portfolio of metallization technologies using ald and pvd and an innovative high temperature etch system 

 

most of applied’s semiconductor equipment products are singlewafer systems with multiple process chambers attached to a base platform this enables each wafer to be processed separately in its own environment allowing precise process control while the system’s multiple chambers enable simultaneous high productivity manufacturing applied sells most of its singlewafer multichamber systems on four basic platforms the centura ®  the endura ®  the producer ® and the vantage ®  these platforms support ald cvd pvd etch and rtp technologies 

 

over time the semiconductor industry has migrated to increasingly larger wafers to build chips the predominant or common wafer size used today for volume production of advanced chips is 300 millimeter mm or 12inch wafers applied offers a comprehensive range of 300mm systems applied also offers earliergeneration 200mm systems as well as products and services to support all of its systems which are reported under its applied global services segment

backlog 

 

applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order backlog and customer commitments backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months and 3 orders for sunfab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months 

 

applied’s backlog increased from 37 billion at october 28 2007 to 48 billion at october 26 2008 applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties backlog adjustments were positive for fiscal 2008 and totaled 140 million consisting primarily of backlog obtained from acquired companies partially offset by cancellations and currency adjustments delays in delivery schedules andor a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

 

applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of procurement assembly test and integration of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies collectively parts that are used to manufacture systems products in the silicon segment are manufactured in austin texas and rehovot israel remanufactured products in the applied global services segment are produced primarily in austin texas products in the display segment are manufactured in santa clara california alzenau germany and tainan taiwan products in the energy and environmental solutions segment are manufactured primarily in alzenau germany cheseaux switzerland treviso italy and santa clara california manufacturing requires raw materials including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components to be manufactured to applied’s specifications applied uses numerous companies including contract manufacturers to supply parts for the manufacture and support of its products although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of production and service interruptions as well as shortages of key parts by 1 selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts 2 monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers 3 maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts 4 qualifying new parts on a timely basis and 5 locating certain manufacturing operations in areas that are closer to suppliers and customers 

 

research development and engineering 

 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new products applied’s significant investment in research development and engineering rde has generally enabled it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology selection cycle applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in europe israel and china in addition applied outsources certain rde activities some of which are performed outside the united states process support and customer demonstration laboratories are located in the united states china europe and israel 

 

applied’s investments in rde for product development and engineering programs to create or improve products and technologies over the last three years were as follows 11 billion 14 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 11 billion 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 and 12 billion 13 percent of net sales in fiscal 2006 applied has spent an average of 13 percent of net sales in rde over the last five years in addition to rde for specific product technologies applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems materials research and environmental control that have applications to its products in fiscal 2008 applied focused on developing systems for semiconductor customers’ new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and highkmetal gate technologies as well as double 

patterning processes that enable customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional technology generations applied also focused on developing technology for throughsilicon vias an emerging solution for interconnecting three dimensional chip stacks to provide better device performance lower power consumption and the integration of heterogeneous devices rde also included activities to develop products that enable lowercost production of solar energy 

 

marketing and sales 

 

because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells products worldwide through a direct sales force approximately 81 percent of applied’s fiscal 2008 net sales were to regions outside of the united states net sales to customers by region as a percentage of total net sales were taiwan 22 percent north america primarily the united states 19 percent asiapacific including china 16 percent korea 16 percent japan 15 percent and europe 12 percent 

 

general economic conditions impact applied’s business and financial results from time to time the markets in which products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may negatively impact sales applied’s business is usually not seasonal in nature but it is cyclical based on capital equipment investment by major semiconductor flat panel display solar pv and other manufacturers these expenditures depend on many factors including anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors lcds solar cells and modules architectural glass and other substrates the development of new technologies customers’ factory utilization capital resources and financing and global and regional economic conditions 

 

applied manages its business and reports financial results based on the segments described above but does not allocate certain sales and marketing costs to the segments 

 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements samsung electronics co ltd accounted for 16 percent of applied’s net sales in fiscal 2008 12 percent of applied’s net sales in fiscal 2007 and 11 percent of applied’s net sales in fiscal 2006 these net sales were for products in multiple reportable segments 

 

competition 

 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity and costeffectiveness the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete with a single product andor in a single region to global diversified companies with a range of products applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde and in marketing sales and global customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

 

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability and to a lesser extent by demand for commercial applications as a result products within the silicon segment are subject to rapid changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technical approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors applied offers a broad portfolio of technically differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively applied allocates resources among its many product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are many competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry with some offering a single product line and others offering 

multiple product lines these competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies 

 

products and services within the applied global services segment are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to reduce costs improve productivity and lessen the environmental impact of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered 

 

products in the display segment are subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors applied holds established market positions with its technically differentiated lcd manufacturing solutions for pecvd color filter pvd and array testing although its market position can change rapidly if it does not meet customers’ requirements in fiscal 2007 applied entered the array pvd market with the aktpivot tm 55kv pvd system as a recent entrant to this market applied faces significant competition from existing array pvd suppliers 

 

applied’s products within the energy and environmental solutions segment compete in diverse market areas including equipment to make solar pv cells and modules flexible electronics and energyefficient glass in solar applied offers products for two distinct technologies csi waferbased and thin film glassbased applications as a recent entrant to the solar equipment business applied competes with many other companies that have more experience with solar applications applied also is a recent entrant to the flexible electronics equipment business which operates in an emerging market sector characterized by diverse types of applications customer requirements and competitors applied’s glass coating equipment faces significant competition from at least one established supplier and another recent market entrant 

 

patents and licenses 

 

management believes that applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon the company’s research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a substantial number of patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in its best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied for the life of the patents applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in dealing with such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

environmental matters 

 

two of applied’s locations have been designated as environmental cleanup sites in 1987 the united states environmental protection agency designated one of the locations in santa clara california as a superfund site and named applied as a “responsible party” cleanup activities at this site began in 1984 and were substantially 

completed in february 2002 the california regional water quality control board designated applied as a “discharger” with respect to another site in sunnyvale california applied was named a discharger upon its acquisition of the property in 1997 solely due to its status as property owner the prior owners of the site andor operators who caused the contamination are responsible for performing cleanup and monitoring activities 

 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance and periodically conducts investigations of possible contamination 

 

compliance with federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following factors could materially affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

 

the industries that applied serves are volatile and unpredictable 

 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending which depend in part on capacity utilization demand for customers’ products inventory levels relative to demand and access to affordable capital these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales operating expenses and net income 

 

to meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries it serves applied must effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments and across multiple segments during periods of decreasing demand for applied’s products applied must be able to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively manage its supply chain and motivate and retain key employees during periods of increasing demand applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer 

demand effectively manage its supply chain and attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals if applied is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment applied’s business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with the ongoing financial crisis and weakening global economy 

 

the recent severe tightening of the credit markets turmoil in the financial markets and weakening global economy are contributing to slowdowns in the industries in which applied operates which slowdowns are expected to worsen if these economic conditions are prolonged or deteriorate further the markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing equipment or service orders which may affect applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales and reduce net sales difficulties in obtaining capital and deteriorating market conditions may also lead to the inability of some customers to obtain affordable financing resulting in lower sales for applied customers with liquidity issues may lead to additional bad debt expense for applied these conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers which could affect their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied’s products further these conditions and uncertainty about future economic conditions make it challenging for applied to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify the risks that may affect its business financial condition and results of operations in addition applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by deteriorating financial market conditions and as a result the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment if applied is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment applied’s business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates 

 

the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries including 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry 

 

the largest portion of applied’s revenues historically has come from sales of manufacturing equipment to the global semiconductor industry and this business historically has also been the most profitable changes in the semiconductor industry may lead to a decrease in the percentage of applied’s revenue attributable to its semiconductor equipment business as a percentage of overall revenue which in turn can negatively impact the company’s net income in addition to the general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry including 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry 

 

the global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels due in part to the limited number of lcd manufacturers and the concentrated nature of lcd enduse applications recently industry growth has depended to a considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs in addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry these include technical and financial difficulties associated with transitioning to larger substrate sizes for lcds as well as the effect of a slowing rate of transition to larger substrate sizes on capital intensity and product differentiation if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry 

 

an increasing portion of applied’s business is in the emerging solar market which applied entered in 2006 and which in addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor is characterized by ongoing changes particular to the solar industry including 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes 

 

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment its future success depends on many factors including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its nanomanufacturing technology equipment service and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including enhancing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates while constantly improving its operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more varied competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may involve higher costs and reduced profits applied’s success is subject to many risks including but not limited to its ability to timely costeffectively and successfully 

 

 16 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage these challenges its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

the entry into new markets and industries entails additional challenges 

 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing nanomanufacturing technology products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions the entry into different markets involves additional challenges including those arising from 

 

  

if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from its entry into new markets and industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

 

in fiscal 2008 approximately 81 percent of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states with a majority of business from customers in asia certain of applied’s rd andor manufacturing facilities as well as suppliers to applied are also located outside the united states including in china the global nature of applied’s business and operations presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

 

 17 

 

  

many of these challenges are present in china which is experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and competitors to applied and which applied believes presents a large potential market for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term in addition applied must regularly reassess the size capability and location of its global infrastructure and make appropriate changes these challenges may materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

 

applied’s semiconductor and flat panel display customer bases historically have been and are becoming even more highly concentrated in addition certain customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners in the solar area while the number of solar pv manufacturing customers is increasing as the number of market entrants grows the size of contracts with particular customers is expected to rise substantially as the industry moves to greater solar module factory output capacity including capacity sufficient to annually generate electricity on a gigawatt scale in this environment contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of semiconductor display and solar manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s business in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or they delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied in addition certain customers have undergone significant ownership andor management changes and outsourced manufacturing activities have engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other customers or have consolidated with other customers which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments 

 

applied has made and in the future intends to make acquisitions of and investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 

 

 18 

 

  

  

applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

 

applied’s business depends on its ability to supply equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers some key parts may be subject to long leadtimes andor obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the united states including china applied may experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

 

  

in addition applied’s need to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet unanticipated increases in demand may exacerbate any interruptions in applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied’s working capital moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts the volatility of demand for capital equipment increases capital technical and other risks for companies in the supply chain any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure to successfully implement and conduct offshoring and outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations 

 

to better align its costs with market conditions increase its presence in growing markets enhance productivity and improve efficiencies applied conducts engineering software development and other operations in regions outside the united states particularly india and china and outsources certain functions to third parties including companies in the united states india china and other countries outsourced functions include certain engineering manufacturing customer support software development information technology support finance and administrative activities the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies assure quality and continuity of supply and protect applied’s intellectual property in addition applied has implemented several key operational initiatives intended to improve manufacturing efficiency including integratetoorder modulefinaltest and mergeintransit programs applied also is implementing a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes which includes transitioning to a single enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions the conversion to this new erp system will include certain risks including difficulties with data integrity and business interruption 

 

if applied does not effectively develop and implement its offshoring and outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing a new erp system or enhancing business processes applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties increased costs including energy and transportation manufacturing interruptions or delays inefficiencies in the structure andor operation of its supply chain loss of its intellectual property rights quality issues increased product timetomarket andor inefficient allocation of human resources any or all of which could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

 

applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions changes in applied’s management or leadership competitors’ hiring practices cost reduction activities and the effectiveness of applied’s compensation programs including its equitybased programs applied periodically evaluates its overall compensation program and makes adjustments as appropriate to enhance its competitiveness if applied does not successfully attract retain and motivate key employees applied may be unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

 

changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results of operations 

 

as a global company applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in the 1 applicable tax laws 2 composition of pretax income in countries with differing tax rates or 3 valuation of applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in addition applied is subject to regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals which could materially and adversely affect applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights 

 

applied from time to time is and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights antitrust environmental regulations securities contracts product 

performance product liability unfair competition employment and other matters in addition applied on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit applied’s ability to sell its products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims applied previously entered into a mutual covenantnottosue arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future there can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with such a covenant in addition applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights furthermore the laws and practices of other countries including china india taiwan and korea permit the protection and enforcement of applied’s rights to varying extents which may not be sufficient to protect applied’s rights if applied is not able to obtain or enforce intellectual property rights resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is subject to risks of noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations 

 

applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacture and use of its products recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products the operation of its facilities and the use of its real property the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in 1 significant remediation liabilities 2 the imposition of fines 3 the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of its products 4 limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property andor 5 a decrease in the value of its real property each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment 

 

applied is subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations if applied is found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws rules or regulations applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 applied must include in its annual report on form 10k a report of management on the effectiveness of applied’s internal control over financial reporting ongoing compliance with this requirement is complex costly and timeconsuming if applied fails to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or applied’s management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control applied could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the public’s perception of applied may decline

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

introduction 

 

management’s discussion and analysis mda is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied’s business and results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with applied’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10k mda consists of the following sections 

 

  

overview 

 

applied provides nanomanufacturing technology tm solutions for the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries with a broad portfolio of innovative equipment service and software products applied’s customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors flat panel liquid crystal displays lcds solar photovoltaic cells and modules solar pvs flexible electronics and energyefficient glass applied operates in four reportable segments silicon applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in north america europe israel and asia applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

 

applied’s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products each of applied’s businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips lcds solar pvs and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes 

 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

fiscal 2008 financial results reflected decreased demand for semiconductor equipment and to a lesser extent service products due to unfavorable market conditions in the semiconductor industry partially offset by increased demand for lcd and solar products new orders decreased from fiscal 2007 due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory foundry and logic chip manufacturers partially offset by increased demand by lcd customers and beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the recognition of orders for applied’s sunfab tm thin film line for manufacturing solar panels net sales decreased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to the decline in investment from memory and logic customers partially offset by increased sales of crystalline silicon csi solar manufacturing products net income decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower net sales offset in part by lower operating expenses fiscal 2008 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs 

fiscal 2007 financial results reflected improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industry’s recovery in 2006 while conditions in the display industry were mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite strong consumer demand for lcd tvs total orders decreased slightly from fiscal 2006 primarily due to the significant decline in demand for display manufacturing products partially offset by increased demand for products and services in all other segments net sales increased during fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 primarily due to strong demand from dynamic random access memory dram and flash memory chip manufacturers partially offset by a significant decline in lcd equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed capacity following substantial investment in 2006 net income improved in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to higher sales and lower operating expenses offset in part by lower interest income fiscal 2007 financial results included restructuring and asset impairment and other charges associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products and an inprocess research and development iprd expense associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of brooks automation inc brooks software 

 

fiscal 2006 results reflected a recovery in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries along with the global economy as enduser demand for electronic products and lcds drove increased customer investments in advanced silicon particularly memory and display products compared to fiscal 2005 during this period applied’s semiconductor customers increased both highvolume production and leadingedge 65nm and 45nm chip development improvements in operating performance were offset in part by restructuring and asset impairment charges and an iprd expense associated with the acquisition of applied films corporation applied films 

 

applied expects an unusually challenging environment for fiscal 2009 the turmoil in the financial markets and weakening global economy are compounding the impact of the highly cyclical markets in which applied operates current negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty have led some customers to decrease factory operations and to reassess their projected spending plans as a result on november 12 2008 applied announced that it will implement a restructuring program beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 in addition applied’s ability to forecast customers’ future investments and its financial targets are limited in this uncertain macroeconomic climate applied currently expects that orders and revenue will be down overall and across most segments in fiscal 2009 with the exception of the energy and environmental solutions segment 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information 

 

 

applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 as a result of these conditions there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales both within and across the fiscal years demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip and lcd supply and demand and other factors including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes 

 

new orders 

 

new orders by geographic region which are attributed according to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

new orders for fiscal 2008 decreased 5 percent to 92 billion from 97 billion in the prior year due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from logic memory and foundry chip manufacturers partially offset by increased demand for lcd and solar equipment including the initial recognition of orders for the applied sunfab tm thin film line demand for lcd equipment slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as display customers absorbed capacity following robust demand over the preceding three quarters 

 

new orders for fiscal 2007 decreased 2 percent to 97 billion from 99 billion in the prior year reflecting delays in investment by lcd customers partially offset by increased demand for solar equipment semiconductor equipment and service products demand for semiconductor equipment slowed in the second half of fiscal 2007 as customers absorbed added capacity while demand from lcd customers recovered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 

 

fiscal 2006 orders of 99 billion reflected increased semiconductor manufacturing equipment orders from memory manufacturers increased service orders as a result of higher customer factory utilization and new product introductions and increased display orders as customers invested in nextgeneration equipment 

 

applied’s backlog for the last three fiscal years was as follows 48 billion at october 26 2008 37 billion at october 28 2007 and 34 billion at october 29 2006 backlog increased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to the inclusion of orders for products obtained through the acquisitions of baccini spa baccini and hct shaping systems sa hct that met applied’s order recognition criteria during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 but did not qualify for order recognition at the time of the acquisition partially offset by debookings primarily of semiconductor equipment and unfavorable currency adjustments backlog consists of 1 orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized 2 contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months and 3 orders for sunfab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods 

net sales 

 

net sales by geographic region which are attributed according to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

during fiscal 2008 net sales decreased by 16 percent to 81 billion from 97 billion in fiscal 2007 due to decreased investment from memory and logic chip manufacturers partially offset by increased demand from solar and lcd customers during fiscal 2007 net sales increased by 6 percent to 97 billion from 92 billion in fiscal 2006 led by strength in memory capacity expansion throughout the year in fiscal 2006 net sales of 92 billion followed the trend of increased orders for the year 

 

gross margin 

 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 424 percent in fiscal 2008 from 461 percent in fiscal 2007 compared to 468 percent in fiscal 2006 the decrease in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was attributable to lower net sales and lower margin product mix the decrease in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was principally attributable to inventoryrelated charges of 56 million associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products incremental charges attributable to acquisitions consisting of inventory fair value adjustments on products sold amortization and product mix partially offset by higher revenue levels and lower material costs gross margin during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 included 32 million 27 million and 37 million respectively of equitybased compensation expense 

 

research development and engineering 

 

applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied historically has maintained its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies rde expenses were 11 billion 14 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 11 billion 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 and 12 billion 13 percent of net sales in fiscal 2006 rde expense during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 included 59 million 56 million and 76 million respectively of equitybased compensation expense development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

 

in fiscal 2008 applied focused on the development of processes and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices applied pioneered a selfaligned double patterning approach that can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional optical lithography the company also developed technology for the 

implementation of throughsilicon vias an emerging solution for interconnecting 3d chip stacks to achieve better device performance lower power consumption reduced costs and the integration of heterogeneous devices efforts were also focused on developing the systems and technology to reduce the costperwatt of solar electricity 

 

in fiscal 2007 applied focused on developing systems for customers’ new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and highkmetal gate technologies and patterning processes to enable customers to extend their existing 193 nm lithography tools through additional technology generations applied also continued to invest in solar research and development 

 

in fiscal 2006 applied continued its development of systems to increase chip performance especially for flash and dram devices applied also focused on developing systems for 32nm and 22nm copperlow k interconnect processing technologies to address critical manufacturing challenges that chipmakers face as they transition to future device generations helping them to bring new products to market more rapidly while minimizing risk applied also continued to focus on developing lcd systems to process larger glass substrates 

 

there were no iprd charges recorded in fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2007 applied recorded an iprd expense of 5 million associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of brooks software a division of brooks automation inc during fiscal 2006 applied recorded an iprd expense in the amount of 14 million related to the acquisition of applied films applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchased acquisitions to iprd was determined through established valuation techniques the iprd was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 

 

marketing selling general and administrative 

 

marketing selling general and administrative expenses were 965 million 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 952 million 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 and 907 million 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2006 the increase in marketing selling general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2007 to 2008 was principally attributable to increased operating costs from business acquisitions and equity compensation expenses offset in part by cost control initiatives the increase in marketing selling general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was principally attributable to increased operating costs from acquired businesses investments in the solar business expansion and increased variable compensation expenses these expenses were partially offset by lower equity compensation expenses and savings from cost control initiatives including ceasing development of beamline implant products and transitioning to managed service providers to perform certain information technology and business infrastructure support marketing selling and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 included 88 million 77 million and 104 million respectively of equitybased compensation expense 

 

restructuring and asset impairments 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 applied announced a global cost reduction plan the plan that primarily affected its silicon and applied global services segments and related support organizations as part of the plan applied reduced its global workforce through a combination of job elimination and attrition for fiscal 2008 applied recorded restructuring charges of 29 million relating to the plan consisting primarily of employee termination costs to reduce its workforce the affected employees were based in north america europe and asia and represented multiple functions 

 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 applied’s board of directors approved a plan the implant plan to cease development of beamline implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the operations of its implant group based in horsham england under the implant plan applied closed its research development and manufacturing operations in horsham in october 2007 costs under the implant plan for fiscal 2008 consisted of restructuring charges of 11 million associated with facilities costs under the implant plan in fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of inventoryrelated charges reported as cost of products sold of 56 million other operating expenses of 10 million and restructuring and asset impairment charges of 30 million also as part of the implant plan applied recorded restructuring charges of 22 million consisting primarily of employee termination costs to reduce its workforce the majority of the affected employees were based in horsham england and represented multiple functions asset impairment charges included 8 million of fixed asset writeoffs the implant group operated in 

the silicon segment and the results of its operations were not material to applied’s financial position or results of operations 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 applied’s board of directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of applied’s real estate and facilities portfolio the disinvestment plan properties with an estimated fair value of 56 million were reported as assets heldforsale and reclassified from property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet during fiscal 2006 applied recorded an asset impairment charge of 124 million to write down the following properties to estimated fair value 1 facilities in narita japan chunan korea hillsboro oregon and danvers massachusetts and 2 26 acres of unimproved land in hillsboro oregon during fiscal 2006 applied sold the danvers facility for net proceeds of 16 million and recognized a gain of 4 million during fiscal 2007 applied sold the hillsboro chunan and narita facilities and the hillsboro land for total net proceeds of 38 million and recognized a gain of 3 million also in fiscal 2006 as part of the disinvestment plan applied recorded lease termination charges in the amount of 89 million related to the closure of its leased hayward california facility 

 

for further details see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

net interest and other income 

 

net interest and other income was 89 million for fiscal 2008 98 million for fiscal 2007 and 149 million for fiscal 2006 

 

the decrease in net interest and other income for fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in shortterm investments and a decrease in interest rates during fiscal 2008 offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities that occurred in september 2007 the decrease in net interest and other income from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in cash and investments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 when applied repurchased 145 million shares of its outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 25 billion under an accelerated stock buyback program 

 

income taxes 

 

applied’s effective income tax provision rate was 318 percent for fiscal 2008 299 percent for fiscal 2007 and 300 percent for fiscal 2006 applied’s effective tax rate was higher for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as fiscal 2007 reflected benefits of 36 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income tax filings partially offset by a 13 million charge from the expensing of equitybased compensation applied’s effective tax rate of 300 percent for fiscal 2006 reflected benefits of 61 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income tax filings partially offset by a 17 million charge from the expensing of equitybased compensation 

 

applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income and nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly 

 

segment information 

 

applied operates in four reportable segments silicon applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions a description of the products and services as well as financial data for each reportable segment can be found in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses which it manages separately at the corporate level these unallocated costs include those for equitybased compensation and certain components of variable compensation corporate marketing and sales corporate functions certain management finance legal human resources and rde and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 applied renamed two of its reportable segments the fab solutions segment was renamed applied global services and the adjacent technologies segment was renamed energy and environmental solutions in addition applied changed its management reporting system for services to report all service results in the applied global services 

segment applied has reclassified segment operating results for fiscal 2007 and 2006 to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation 

 

discussions below include the results of each reportable segment 

 

silicon segment 

 

the silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition etch rapid thermal processing rtp chemical mechanical planarization cmp and metrology and inspection development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key technical challenges including transistor performance and nanoscale patterning and on improving chip manufacturing productivity to reduce costs 

 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 

 

silicon new orders decreased 38 percent to 41 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease in new orders was due to reduced demand for equipment from logic memory and foundry customers net sales decreased 38 percent to 40 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease in net sales was due to decreased investment by logic and memory customers operating income decreased 48 percent to 12 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease in operating income was due to significantly lower revenue levels from the slowdown in the semiconductor equipment industry partially offset by lower operating expenses attributable to continued focus on cost controls and improvement in manufacturing activities in fiscal 2008 the company launched two key products for photomask applications the applied aera2 mask inspection system which detects critical defects on a photomask and the applied tetra reticle clean system which cleans 32nm and below photomasks using wet clean chemistry the company also introduced the applied producer eharp system for depositing films in high aspect ratio device structures 

 

silicon orders increased 1 percent to 67 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 reflecting the semiconductor industry’s strength during this period driven by demand for cell phones computers digital tvs game consoles mp3 players and other electronic products the majority of new orders were for memory applications as customers invested in leadingedge flash and dram memory devices while orders from foundries remained at low levels net sales increased 9 percent to 65 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase in net sales was due to increased investment by memory and logic semiconductor customers in multiple areas including etch inspection and rtp products operating income increased 19 percent to 24 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase in operating income was due to higher revenue levels and continued focus on cost controls operating income for fiscal 2007 included charges of 66 million related to ceasing development of beamline implant products in fiscal 2007 the company launched the applied producer gt a significant redesign of its successful producer platform that offers faster more costeffective cvd processing for 45 nm and beyond applications to meet the challenges of fabricating nextgeneration transistors applied announced its portfolio of highkmetal gate solutions including the applied advanced gate stack and applied centura carina etch systems other new etch systems introduced were the applied mariana trench for etching high aspect ratio structures the applied opus advantedge metal etch with a new 5chamber platform and the applied centura tetra iii advanced reticle etch the company also added to its line of lithographyenabling systems with the new applied producer ace sacvd and added to its line of strain engineering solutions with the applied producer celera cvd 

 

during fiscal 2006 leading semiconductor manufacturers reported increased sales as the electronics market continued to grow the demand for consumer electronics including broadband personal computers and cell phones with increasing digital content and complex chips resulted in increased chip demand and the need for additional capacity in addition to expanding consumer electronics demand corporate information technology investment increased with an emphasis on security server consolidation and more robust internet infrastructures during 

fiscal 2006 demand increased in many areas including etch inspection and thin films products improved operating results in fiscal 2006 reflected an increase in business volume offset in part by increases in variable compensation expenses applied continued its development of systems to increase chip performance especially for flash and dram devices to extend the usefulness of aluminum the material used by many memory manufacturers for interconnects to the sub70nm node the company introduced two products the applied endura cvd al technology and applied centura advantedge metal etch system for faster copper interconnects applied launched its enhanced endura cubss ii system with aktiv preclean extending the system’s capability to the 45nm node and below especially for use with ultralow dielectric constant low k films the company introduced the applied endura ilb ii integrated linerbarrier system offering advances in pvd titanium and preclean technologies to provide significantly reduced resistance for contact structures the company also focused on providing solutions to extend customers’ lithography technology introducing the applied producer apfe advanced patterning film enhancement system the new apfe film enables chipmakers to costeffectively pattern nanoscale features without additional integration complexity while reducing their reliance on nextgeneration lithography systems 

 

applied currently expects that the uncertain economic conditions including credit concerns and lower consumer spending will lead to further decline in demand for semiconductor equipment in fiscal 2009 

 

applied global services segment 

 

the applied global services segment encompasses technically differentiated products including spares services certain earlier generation equipment products and remanufactured equipment to improve operating efficiency reduce operating costs and lessen the environmental impact of semiconductor display and solar customers’ factories customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites 

 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 

 

fiscal 2008 results were impacted by lower levels of semiconductor and display customers’ factory utilization new orders decreased 10 percent to 22 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower orders for spares fabwide services and refurbished equipment partially offset by increased orders for service and system enhancements net sales decreased 1 percent to 23 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the net sales decrease reflected lower sales of fabwide services and spares offset by increased sales in services and system enhancements operating income decreased 9 percent to 575 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to higher operating expenses in fiscal 2008 

 

new orders increased 4 percent to 25 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase in new orders reflected increased demand for spare parts and services as well as demand for factory automation products obtained as part of the brooks software acquisition net sales of 24 billion in fiscal 2007 were slightly up compared to fiscal 2006 due to increased factory automation sales offset by declines in spares sales fiscal 2007 remanufactured equipment orders and net sales remained consistent with fiscal 2006 levels operating income decreased 8 percent to 630 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 reflecting product mix and increased operating expenses and charges related to the brooks software acquisition 

 

net sales in 2006 reflected increases in spare parts shipments and service contracts as a result of higher wafer starts and an increase in 200mm remanufactured equipment investment during fiscal 2006 operating results reflected improved operational efficiencies and savings from cost control initiatives applied also expanded its product offerings with the introduction of abatement systems for reducing perfluorocarbon pfc emissions and additional chamber performance services capabilities 

fiscal 2007 and 2006 new orders net sales and operating income increased from the previously reported amounts due to the reclassification in fiscal 2008 of display service products from the display segment 

 

applied currently expects that the uncertain global economic conditions will lead to lower factory utilization by applied’s customers resulting in lower demand for applied global services’ products in fiscal 2009 

 

display segment 

 

the display segment encompasses products for manufacturing lcds for tvs personal computers and other videoenabled devices the business is focused on expanding market share by differentiation with largerscale substrates entry into new markets and development of products to enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity 

 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 

 

new orders increased significantly to 15 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to 273 million in fiscal 2007 increased orders were due to substantial increases in demand by display customers in response to strong endproduct demand this demand for lcd equipment reached an inflexion point in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 reflecting the volatility of the display industry net sales increased 38 percent to 976 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to customers’ investment in gen8 products operating income increased to 310 million in fiscal 2008 from 159 million in fiscal 2007 operating income increased due to higher revenue levels product mix and lower operating costs in fiscal 2008 the company introduced its gen10 systems that can process substrates sized at approximately 285 x 305 meters these systems include the akt90k pecvd and akt90k ebt products 

 

new orders decreased 69 percent to 273 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 reflecting delays in capacity expansion plans by lcd panel makers in light of excess inventories and end product sales price declines display customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as panel makers began to experience more favorable market conditions net sales decreased 14 percent to 705 million in fiscal 2007 the decrease in net sales was attributable to lower investment by lcd manufacturers as they absorbed capacity operating income decreased 38 percent to 159 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to lower revenues and factory absorption product mix and higher operating expenses in support of the expanded product portfolio resulting from the acquisition of applied films in july 2006 in 2007 applied launched the aktpivot tm 55kv system which employs highproductivity costefficient pvd technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide films on the substrate 

 

during fiscal 2006 price reductions in consumer electronics accelerated the growth of the flat panel display market as a result display manufacturers increased investments in gen7 gen75 and gen8 systems in addition laptop demand continued to be strong resulting in additional gen5 and gen55 fab investment with the acquisition of applied films in fiscal 2006 applied entered the pvd color filter market during the last quarter of fiscal 2006 flat panel equipment demand began to slow as customers aligned their capacity plans and inventory levels fiscal 2006 results included a 5 million iprd expense related to the acquisition of applied films applied launched three fpd systems the akt55k ebt the akt55k pecvd and the aktnew aristo 2200 for manufacturing gen85 panels sized at 22m x 25m which produce up to six 55inch lcd tv screens 

 

fiscal 2007 and 2006 new orders net sales and operating income reported herein are lower than the previously reported amounts due to the reclassification in fiscal 2008 of display service products from the display segment to the applied global services segment 

applied currently expects that the uncertain global economic conditions will result in decreasing consumer spending leading to lower factory utilization by flat panel display manufacturers and lower demand for lcd equipment in fiscal 2009 

 

energy and environmental solutions segment 

 

the energy and environmental solutions segment includes products for fabricating solar pv cells and modules high throughput rolltoroll coating systems for flexible electronics and web products and systems used in the manufacture of energyefficient glass applied began offering these products after the acquisition of applied films in fiscal 2006 this segment also includes products for manufacturing csi solar pvs that were obtained through the acquisitions of hct in fiscal 2007 and baccini in fiscal 2008 this business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy with an emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar power by providing equipment to enhance manufacturing scale and efficiency 

 

certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 

 

new orders of 13 billion in fiscal 2008 increased from 245 million in fiscal 2007 the increase in new orders was primarily due to the recognition of orders for the applied sunfab tm thin film line that began in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as well as growth in orders for csi products net sales of 819 million in fiscal 2008 increased from 165 million in fiscal 2007 due to customers’ investment in csi products from the acquisitions of hct and baccini and increased sales across all other products in the segment the increase in net sales for fiscal 2008 included the first revenue recognition of an applied sunfab tm thin film line the operating loss of 183 million in fiscal 2008 increased from 89 million in fiscal 2007 the increase in operating loss reflected increased rde spending to develop products that enable lowercost production of solar energy increased operating costs amortization of acquisitionrelated costs and costs related to expansion of solar marketing efforts partially offset by higher revenues

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

 

applied’s cash cash equivalents and investments decreased to 35 billion at october 26 2008 from 37 billion at october 28 2007 due primarily to share repurchases and cash dividend distributions offset by cash generated from operating activities applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years

in the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries as of october 26 2008 the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee arrangements was 167 million applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 

 

applied expects that changes in its business will affect its working capital components primarily related to its energy and environmental solutions segment which includes products for manufacturing solar pvs applied believes that the solar industry is moving to increasingly greater factory output of solar modules including projects with an output capable of generating electricity on a gigawatt scale applied has entered into contracts with multiple customers for its sunfab tm thin film line for projects of varying scale fulfillment of these contracts requires applied to invest in inventory particularly work in process and applied may obtain customer deposits that reduce the associated effect on other working capital components 

 

applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade municipal bonds money market mutual funds us treasury and agency securities corporate bonds equity securities and mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures which may include the sale of certain securities to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies in fiscal 2008 as part of its regular investment review process applied recorded an insignificant impairment charge 

associated with its investment portfolio at october 26 2008 applied had a gross unrealized loss of 48 million due to a decrease in the fair market value of certain fixedrate debt and equity securities as a result of the recent turmoil in the global financial markets applied regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair market value has been lower than the cost basis the financial condition credit quality and nearterm prospects of the investee and applied’s ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair market value generally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of the investments while applied cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity applied believes that its investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the risks in its investment portfolio the following types of financial instruments may present additional risks arising from liquidity andor credit concerns structured investment vehicles auction rate securities subprime and “alta” mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations at october 26 2008 applied’s holdings in these categories of investments totaled 30 million or 1 of total cash cash equivalents and investments which applied does not consider to be material in the event that these categories of investments become illiquid applied does not believe that this will materially affect the company’s liquidity or results of operations 

 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months in november 2008 applied announced that it had temporarily suspended stock repurchases in order to maintain financial flexibility in light of the deteriorating global economic and market conditions for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended october 26 2008 see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

during the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by applied or its subsidiaries as of october 26 2008 the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 167 million applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below that required applied to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 26 2008 

 

 

 

 

 42 

 

in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above the company has certain tax obligations during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 the company historically has classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities upon adoption of fin 48 the company reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of october 26 2008 the company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of 63 million and gross interest and penalties of 8 million of the 8 million in interest and penalties 5 million is classified as longterm payable and 3 million is classified as current payable on the consolidated balance sheet at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and accordingly such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies 

 

warranty costs 

 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

inventory valuation 

 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

goodwill and intangible assets 

 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

income taxes 

 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 

 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

equitybased compensation — employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans 

 

effective on october 31 2005 applied began accounting for stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas 123r which requires recognition of the fair value of equitybased compensation the fair value of stock options and espp shares is estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award the fair value of equitybased compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award and applied has elected to use the straightline method the fair value of restricted stock units is calculated based upon the fair market value of applied’s common stock at the date of grant see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

at october 26 2008 applied’s investment portfolio included fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 22 billion applied’s primary objective for investing in fixedincome securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 26 2008 and october 28 2007 an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 31 million and 31 million respectively while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired 

 

all of applied’s debt bears interest at fixed rates therefore an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen euro israeli shekel and swiss francs applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within 24 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied’s results of operations for fiscal 2008 2007 or 2006 

 

forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen euro israeli shekel and swiss francs and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions applied’s outstanding forward exchange contracts are markedtomarket see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged therefore the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions the effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations applied’s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option premiums paid for options outstanding at october 26 2008 were not material

silicon segment 

 

applied’s silicon systems group ssg reported under its silicon segment develops manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips or integrated circuits most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components such as transistors and other devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring interconnects applied offers systems that perform most of the primary steps in the chip fabrication process including atomic layer deposition ald chemical vapor deposition cvd physical vapor deposition pvd etch rapid thermal processing rtp chemical mechanical planarization cmp wafer wet cleaning and wafer metrology and inspection as well as systems that etch measure and inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by both integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build memory logic and other types of chips 

 

to build a chip the transistors capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove successive film layers similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer as the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing power in the same or smaller area the complexity of building the chip also increases necessitating more process steps to form smaller structures and more intricate wiring schemes a typical simplified process sequence for building the wiring portion of chips involves initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a cvd system an etch system is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer to form the metal wiring these openings and patterns are subsequently filled with conducting material using pvd andor electroplating technologies a cmp step then polishes the wafer to achieve a flat surface additional deposition etch and cmp steps are then performed to build up the layers of wiring needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements to form the chip advanced chip designs require about 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle 

 

a significant portion of the process steps used in chipmaking are performed to build the interconnect a complex matrix of microscopic wires that carry electrical signals to connect the transistor and capacitor components of a chip while some customers building memory chips are still using aluminum as the main conducting material for the interconnect logic customers have transitioned to copper copper has lower resistance than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing copperbased chips and supplies systems for depositing etching and planarizing the copper interconnect layers complementing the transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low dielectric constant low k films to replace silicon dioxide material as the insulator between the copper wiring structures applied leads the industry in providing systems for depositing low k dielectric films 

the transistor is another key area of the chip in which semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs to enhance speed applied has the industry’s largest portfolio of technically advanced products for building smaller and faster transistors one such area is strain engineering a technique that stretches or compresses the space between atoms allowing electrical current to flow more quickly thus greatly enhancing chip performance multiple strain films are typically used in advanced devices since they have an additive effect on increasing transistor speed applied has a comprehensive portfolio of systems to enable these applications using cvd and epitaxial deposition technologies

applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of procurement assembly test and integration of various proprietary and commercial parts components and subassemblies parts that are used to manufacture systems products in the silicon segment are manufactured in austin texas and rehovot israel remanufactured products in the fab solutions segment are produced primarily in austin texas products in the display segment are manufactured in santa clara california alzenau germany and tainan taiwan products in the adjacent technologies segment are manufactured primarily in alzenau germany cheseaux switzerland and santa clara california manufacturing requires raw materials including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components to be manufactured to applied’s specifications applied uses numerous companies to supply parts for the manufacture and support of its products although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of production and service interruptions as well as shortages of key parts by 1 qualifying and selecting alternate suppliers for key parts 2 monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers 3 maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts and 4 qualifying new parts on a timely basis 

 

research development and engineering 

 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new products applied’s significant investment in research development and engineering rde has generally enabled it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology selection cycle applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in europe and israel in addition applied outsources certain rde activities some of which are performed outside the united states process support and customer demonstration laboratories are located in the united states china europe and israel 

 

applied invested 11 billion 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 12 billion 13 percent of net sales in fiscal 2006 and 941 million 13 percent of net sales in fiscal 2005 in rde for product development and engineering programs to create new products and to improve existing technologies and products applied has spent an average of 13 percent of net sales in rde over the last five years in addition to rde for specific product technologies applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems materials research and environmental control that have applications to its products in fiscal 2007 applied focused on developing systems for customers’ new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and highk metal gates and patterning processes that will enable customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional technology generations 

 

marketing and sales 

 

because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells products worldwide through a direct sales force more than 84 percent of applied’s fiscal 2007 net sales were to regions outside of the united states net sales to customers by region as a percentage of total net sales were taiwan 28 percent korea 19 percent north america primarily the united states 16 percent japan 15 percent asiapacific including china 12 percent and europe 10 percent 

general economic conditions impact applied’s business and financial results from time to time the markets in which products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may negatively impact sales applied’s business is usually not seasonal in nature but it is cyclical based on capital equipment investment by major semiconductor flat panel display and other manufacturers these expenditures depend on many factors including anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors lcds solar cells architectural glass and other substrates the development of new technologies factory utilization and global and regional economic conditions 

 

applied manages its business and reports financial results based on the segments described above but does not allocate certain sales and marketing costs to the segments 

 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements samsung electronics co ltd accounted for 12 percent of applied’s net sales in fiscal 2007 11 percent of applied’s net sales in fiscal 2006 and 10 percent of applied’s net sales in fiscal 2005 these net sales were for products in multiple reportable segments 

 

competition 

 

the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology continually improve its products and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation productivity and costeffectiveness the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs including product mix and respective product requirements applications and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions substantial competition exists in all areas of applied’s business competitors range from small companies that compete with a single product andor in a single region to global diversified companies with a range of products applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in rde and in marketing sales and customer support activities management believes that many of applied’s products have strong competitive positions 

 

the competitive environment for each segment is described below 

 

the semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lowercost electronic products with increased capability and to a lesser extent by demand for commercial applications as a result products within the silicon segment are subject to rapid changes in customer requirements including transitions to smaller dimensions larger wafer sizes new materials and an increasing number of applications while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements some applications create the need for an entirely different technical approach the rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and create opportunities for many existing and new competitors applied offers a broad portfolio of technically differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively applied allocates resources among its many product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products there are many competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry with some offering a single product line and others offering multiple product lines these competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to global diversified companies 

 

products and services within the fab solutions segment are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors to compete effectively applied offers products and services to reduce costs improve productivity and lessen the environmental impact of customers’ fab operations significant competitive factors include productivity costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered 

 

products in the display segment are subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors applied holds established market positions with its technically differentiated lcd manufacturing solutions for the pecvd color filter cf sputtering and array testing although its market position can change rapidly if it does not meet customers’ requirements applied introduced a new array sputtering tool in fiscal 2007 as a recent entrant applied faces significant competition from existing array sputtering suppliers 

applied’s products within the adjacent technologies segment compete in diverse market areas including equipment to make solar cells flexible electronics and energyefficient glass in solar applied offers products for two distinct technologies csi waferbased and thin film glass modules as a recent entrant to the solar equipment business applied competes with many other companies that have more experience with solar applications applied also is a recent entrant to the flexible electronics equipment business which operates in an emerging market sector characterized by diverse types of applications customer requirements and competitors applied’s glass coating equipment faces significant competition from at least one established supplier and another recent market entrant 

 

patents and licenses 

 

management believes that applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon the company’s research development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a substantial number of patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new inventions although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in its best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied for the life of the patents applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in dealing with such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms or at all if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

environmental matters 

 

two of applied’s locations have been designated as environmental cleanup sites in 1987 the united states environmental protection agency designated one of the locations in santa clara california as a superfund site and named applied as a “responsible party” cleanup activities at this site began in 1984 and were substantially completed in february 2002 the california regional water quality control board designated applied as a “discharger” with respect to another site in sunnyvale california applied was named a discharger upon its acquisition of the property in 1997 solely due to its status as property owner the prior owners of the site andor operators who caused the contamination are responsible for performing cleanup and monitoring activities 

 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance and periodically conducts investigations of possible contamination 

 

compliance with federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following factors could materially affect applied’s business financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report 

 

the industries that applied serves are volatile and unpredictable 

 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and related industries applied is subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which may vary by reportable segment the industries have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending which depend in part on capacity utilization demand for customers’ products and inventory levels relative to demand the effects on applied of these changes in demand including endcustomer demand are occurring more rapidly these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales gross margin contributed profit and results of operations 

 

applied must effectively manage its resources and production capacity to meet rapidly changing demand during periods of decreasing demand applied’s products applied must be able to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions motivate and retain key employees and effectively manage its supply chain during periods of increasing demand applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals and effectively manage its supply chain if applied is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in industry cycles applied’s business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries 

 

the global industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes including 1 higher capital requirements for building and operating new semiconductor and lcd fabrication plants and the resulting effect on customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital 2 differing rates of market growth for and capital investments by various semiconductor device makers such as memory including nand flash and dram logic and foundry as well as lcd and solar manufacturers 3 industry growth rates 4 the increasing cost and decreasing affordability of research and development due to many factors including decreasing linewidths the increasing number of materials applications and process steps and the greater complexity of process development and chip design 5 the increasing difficulty for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing 6 the importance of reducing the cost of system ownership due in part to the increasing significance of consumer electronics as a driver for semiconductor and lcd demand and the related focus on lower prices 7 varying levels of business information technology spending 8 the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for systems as a result of their increasing productivity device yield and reliability 9 the growing types and varieties of semiconductors and expanding number of applications across multiple substrate sizes resulting in customers’ divergent technical demands 10 demand for shorter cycle times for the development manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment 11 the challenge to semiconductor manufacturers of moving volume manufacturing from one technology node to the next smaller technology node and the resulting impact on the technology transition rate and the rate of investment in capital equipment 12 price trends for certain semiconductor devices and lcds 13 difficulties associated with transitioning to larger substrate sizes and 14 the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to assure maximum system uptime if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes 

 

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment its future success depends on many factors including the effective development commercialization and customer acceptance of its nanomanufacturing technology equipment service and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including enhancing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets and cultivating new markets while constantly improving its operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more varied competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time applied’s success is subject to many risks including but not limited to its ability to timely costeffectively and successfully 1 improve andor develop new applications for existing products adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications andor markets with varying technical requirements and develop new products 2 appropriately price and achieve market acceptance of products 3 maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets customers and applications 4 appropriately allocate resources including rde funding among applied’s products and between the development of new products and the improvement of existing products 5 accurately forecast demand and meet production schedules for its products 6 achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings 7 increase market share in existing markets expand its markets and exceed the industry growth rate 8 adapt to technology changes in related markets such as lithography 9 adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain 10 qualify products for volume manufacturing with its customers 11 implement changes in its design engineering methodology including those that enable significant decreases in material costs and cycle time greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems and greater effectiveness of product life cycle management and 12 improve its manufacturing processes furthermore new or improved products may involve higher costs and reduced margins if applied does not successfully manage these challenges its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

the entry into new markets and industries entails additional challenges 

 

as part of its growth strategy applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries either with its existing nanomanufacturing technology products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions these include the emerging solar market which applied entered in 2006 and which is subject to ongoing changes in demand for photovoltaic pv products arising from among other things fluctuations in the cost of electric power availability of government incentives changes in government energy policies the performance and reliability of pv technology and the success of other renewable energy sources the entry into different markets involves additional challenges including those arising from 1 applied’s ability to anticipate demand and capitalize on opportunities and avoid or minimize risks 2 new customers and suppliers including some with limited operating histories uncertain andor limited funding andor locations in regions where applied does not have existing operations 3 the adoption of new business models such as the supply of a suite of applied and nonapplied equipment sufficient to manufacture solar cells 4 difficulties in production planning and execution 5 new materials processes and technologies 6 applied’s ability to drive efficiencies and cost reductions 7 the need to attract motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas 8 different service requirements and 9 intellectual property rights of others if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from entry into new markets and industries its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

 

in fiscal 2007 approximately 84 percent of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states a rising percentage of applied’s business is from customers in asia certain of applied’s rde andor manufacturing facilities as well as suppliers to applied are also located outside the united states including in china managing applied’s global operations presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 1 global uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries 2 varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands 3 global trade issues 4 variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights in different countries 5 concerns of us governmental agencies regarding possible 

national commercial andor security issues posed by the growing manufacturing business in asia 6 fluctuating raw material and energy costs 7 variations in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses 8 changes in laws and regulations of the united states including export restrictions and other countries as well as their interpretation and application 9 fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates including the weakening relative position of the us dollar 10 the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations 11 political instability natural disasters such as earthquakes floods or storms pandemics terrorism or acts of war in locations where applied has operations suppliers or sales 12 cultural differences 13 special customer or governmentsupported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors 14 shipping costs andor delays and 15 adverse conditions in credit markets many of these challenges are present in china which is experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and competitors to applied and which applied believes presents a large potential market for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term in addition applied must regularly reassess the size capability and location of its global infrastructure and make appropriate changes these challenges may materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries 

 

applied’s semiconductor and flat panel display customer base historically has been and is becoming even more highly concentrated orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s net sales in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or they delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied in addition certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes have outsourced manufacturing activities andor have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key semiconductor manufacturers in technology decisions made by their partners which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments 

 

applied has made and in the future intends to make acquisitions of and investments in companies technologies or products in existing related or new markets for applied acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 1 diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters 2 inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all 3 inability to realize anticipated benefits 4 failure to commercialize purchased technologies 5 inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from applied’s existing markets 6 exposure to operational risks rules and regulations to the extent such activities are located in countries where applied has not historically done business 7 inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies 8 ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal controls 9 impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired company or its product offerings 10 unknown underestimated andor undisclosed commitments or liabilities 11 excess or underutilized facilities and 12 ineffective integration of operations technologies products or employees of the acquired companies applied also makes strategic investments in other companies including companies formed as joint ventures which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and particularly with respect to joint ventures requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

 

applied’s business depends on its ability to supply equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers some key parts may be subject to long leadtimes andor obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers in developing regions including china significant interruptions of manufacturing operations or the delivery of services as a result of 1 the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts 2 volatility in the availability and cost of materials 3 difficulties or delays in obtaining required export approvals 4 information technology or infrastructure failures 5 natural disasters such as earthquakes floods or storms or 6 other causes such as regional economic downturns pandemics political instability terrorism or acts of war could result in delayed deliveries manufacturing inefficiencies increased costs or order cancellations moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the failure to successfully implement and conduct offshoring and outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations 

 

to better align its costs with market conditions increase its presence in growing markets improve its tax structure and enhance productivity and operational efficiency applied conducts engineering software development and other operations in regions outside the united states particularly india and china and outsources certain functions to third parties including companies in the united states india china and other countries outsourced functions include certain engineering manufacturing customer support software development information technology support and administrative activities the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies assure quality and protect applied’s intellectual property in addition applied has implemented several key operational initiatives intended to improve manufacturing efficiency including integratetoorder modulefinaltest and mergeintransit programs applied also is implementing a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes which includes transitioning to a singlevendor enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions if applied does not effectively develop and implement its offshoring and outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing a new erp system or enhancing business processes applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties increased costs manufacturing interruptions or delays loss of its intellectual property rights quality issues increased product timetomarket andor inefficient allocation of human resources any or all of which could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

 

applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions changes in applied’s management or leadership competitors’ hiring practices and the effectiveness of applied’s compensation programs including its equitybased programs applied regularly evaluates its overall compensation program and makes adjustments as appropriate to enhance its competitiveness if applied does not successfully attract retain and motivate key employees applied’s ability to capitalize on its opportunities and its operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results of operations 

 

as a global company applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in the 1 applicable tax laws 2 composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or 3 valuation of applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in addition applied is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals which could materially and adversely affect applied’s results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights 

 

applied from time to time is and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights antitrust environmental regulations securities contracts product performance product liability unfair competition employment and other matters in addition applied on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and also divert management’s attention and resources there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims applied previously entered into a mutual covenantnottosue arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future there can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with such a covenant in addition applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if applied does not adequately assert these rights furthermore the laws and practices of other countries including china taiwan and korea permit the protection and enforcement of applied’s rights to varying extents which may not be sufficient to protect applied’s rights if applied is not able to obtain or enforce intellectual property rights resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is subject to risks of noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations 

 

applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacture and use of its products recycling and disposal of materials used in its products the operation of its facilities and the use of its real property the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in 1 significant remediation liabilities 2 the imposition of fines 3 the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of its products 4 limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property andor 5 a decrease in the value of its real property each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment 

 

applied is subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations if applied is found by a court or 

regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws rules or regulations applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 applied must include in its annual report on form 10k a report of management on the effectiveness of applied’s internal control over financial reporting ongoing compliance with this requirement is complex costly and timeconsuming if 1 applied fails to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 2 applied’s management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control or 3 applied’s independent registered public accounting firm does not timely deliver an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of applied’s internal controls applied could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the public’s perception of applied may decline

as a supplier to these industries applied’s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for integrated circuits which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products applied’s business is subject to cyclical industry conditions as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips lcds and other electronic devices as well as other factors such as global economic conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes 

 

the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

fiscal 2007 financial results reflected improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industry’s recovery in 2006 while conditions in the display industry were mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite strong consumer demand for lcd tvs total orders decreased slightly from fiscal 2006 primarily due to the significant decline in demand for display manufacturing products partially offset by increased demand for products and services in all other segments net sales increased during fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 primarily due to strong demand from dram and flash memory chip manufacturers partially offset by a significant decline in lcd equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed capacity following substantial growth in 2006 net income improved in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to higher sales and lower operating expenses offset in 

part by lower interest income fiscal 2007 financial results included equitybased compensation expenses restructuring and asset impairment and other charges associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products and an inprocess research and development iprd expense associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of brooks automation inc brooks software 

 

in fiscal 2006 customer demand improved over fiscal 2005 resulting in higher orders and revenue fiscal 2006 results reflected a recovery in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries and the global economy as enduser demand for electronic products and lcds drove increased customer investments in advanced silicon particularly memory and display products during this period applied’s semiconductor customers increased both highvolume production and leadingedge 65nm and 45nm chip development improvements in operating performance were offset in part by restructuring and asset impairment charges associated with real estate and facilities disinvestment equitybased compensation expenses and an iprd expense associated with the acquisition of applied films corporation applied films 

 

fiscal 2005 financial results reflected a challenging environment as applied’s customers decreased fab utilization globally and reduced or delayed capital expenditures as a result of excess inventories and slowing demand for chips in this period applied focused on lowering costs improving efficiencies reducing cycle time and bringing new products to market 

 

applied expects a challenging environment for the first part of fiscal 2008 uncertain economic conditions including higher energy prices credit concerns and changes in consumer confidence have led to reduced demand in the semiconductor equipment industry as a result semiconductor equipment customers are expected to invest at levels lower than in 2007 offset in part by the anticipated onset of a recovery in the flat panel display industry and growth in other markets 

 

results of operations 

 

quarterly and full fiscal year financial information is as follows 

 

 

 

applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2005 2006 and 2007 as a result of these conditions there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales both within and 

across the fiscal years demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip and lcd supply and demand and other factors including rapid technological advances in fabrication processes 

 

new orders 

 

new orders by geographic region which were attributed to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

new orders for fiscal 2007 decreased 2 percent to 97 billion from 99 billion in the prior year reflecting delays in investment by lcd customers partially offset by increased demand for solar equipment semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products demand for semiconductor equipment slowed in the second half of fiscal 2007 as customers absorbed added capacity lcd customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 

 

new orders for fiscal 2006 increased 55 percent to 99 billion from 64 billion in the prior year as customer demand increased fiscal 2006 orders reflected increased semiconductor manufacturing equipment orders from memory manufacturers increased service orders as a result of higher customer factory utilization and new product introductions and increased display orders as customers invested in next generation equipment new orders for fiscal 2005 decreased to 64 billion reflecting a challenging environment as semiconductor manufacturers reduced their capital investments to align inventories with demand 

 

applied’s backlog for the last three fiscal years was as follows 37 billion at october 28 2007 34 billion at october 29 2006 and 26 billion at october 30 2005 backlog consists only of orders for which written authorizations have been accepted shipment dates within 12 months have been assigned and revenue has not been recognized due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods 

net sales 

 

net sales by geographic region which were attributed to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

during fiscal 2007 net sales increased by 6 percent from 92 billion in fiscal 2006 to 97 billion in fiscal 2007 led by strength in memory capacity expansion throughout the year in fiscal 2006 following the trend of increasing orders that year net sales increased by 31 percent from 70 billion in fiscal 2005 to 92 billion in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2005 net sales of 70 billion reflected lower demand for semiconductor products 

 

gross margin 

 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 461 percent in fiscal 2007 from 468 percent in fiscal 2006 which was an increase from 441 percent in fiscal 2005 the decrease in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was principally attributable to inventoryrelated charges of 56 million associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products incremental charges attributable to acquisitions consisting of inventory fair value adjustments on products sold amortization and product mix partially offset by higher revenue levels and lower material costs gross margin during fiscal 2006 and 2007 included 37 million and 27 million respectively of equitybased compensation expense the increase in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was principally attributable to the combination of higher revenue levels decreased product costs and increased manufacturing volume and absorption partially offset by increased variable and equitybased compensation costs applied began recognizing expenses associated with stock options and the espp in fiscal 2006 

 

research development and engineering 

 

applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies rde expenses were 11 billion 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 12 billion 13 percent of net sales in fiscal 2006 and 941 million 13 percent of net sales in fiscal 2005 rde expense during fiscal 2006 and 2007 included 76 million and 56 million respectively of equitybased compensation expense development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product which typically has a shorter development cycle or a new product which typically has a longer development cycle most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing or new product areas to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

 

in fiscal 2007 applied focused on developing systems for customers’ new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and highk metal gates and 

patterning processes that will enable customers to extend their existing 193 nm lithography tools through additional technology generations applied also continued to invest in solar research and development 

 

in fiscal 2006 applied continued its development of systems to increase chip performance especially for flash and dram devices applied also focused on developing systems for 32nm and 22nm copperlow k interconnect processing technologies to address critical manufacturing challenges that chipmakers face as they transition to future device generations helping them to bring new products to market more rapidly while minimizing risk applied also continued to focus on developing lcd systems to process larger glass substrates 

 

in fiscal 2005 applied focused on developing systems for customers’ advanced chip designs including systems to enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures with 65nm 45nm and below geometries and lcd systems to process larger glass substrates 

 

during fiscal 2007 applied recorded an iprd expense of 5 million associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of brooks software during fiscal 2006 applied recorded an iprd expense in the amount of 14 million related to the acquisition of applied films applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchased acquisitions to iprd was determined through established valuation techniques the iprd was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed no iprd charges were recorded in fiscal 2005 

 

marketing selling general and administrative 

 

marketing selling general and administrative expenses were 952 million 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2007 907 million 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2006 and 697 million 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2005 the increase in marketing selling general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was principally attributable to increased operating costs from acquired businesses investments in the solar business expansion and increased variable compensation expenses these expenses were partially offset by lower equity compensation expenses and savings from cost control initiatives including ceasing development of beamline implant products and transitioning to managed service providers to perform certain information technology and business infrastructure support marketing sales and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2006 and 2007 included 104 million and 77 million respectively of equitybased compensation expense the increase from fiscal 2005 to 2006 correlated to the increase in business volume as well as increases in variable compensation as a result of improved operating performance equitybased compensation expense and early spending on applied’s implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system partially offset by savings resulting from applied’s continued focus on controlling its overall cost structure 

 

restructuring and asset impairments 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 applied’s board of directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of applied’s real estate and facilities portfolio the disinvestment plan properties with an estimated fair value of 56 million were reported as assets heldforsale and reclassified from property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet during fiscal 2006 applied recorded an asset impairment charge of 124 million to write down the following properties to estimated fair value 1 facilities in narita japan chunan korea hillsboro oregon and danvers massachusetts and 2 26 acres of unimproved land in hillsboro oregon during fiscal 2006 applied sold the danvers facility for net proceeds of 16 million and recognized a gain of 4 million during fiscal 2007 applied sold the hillsboro chunan and narita facilities and the hillsboro land for total net proceeds of 38 million and recognized a gain of 3 million also in fiscal 2006 as part of the disinvestment plan applied recorded lease termination charges in the amount of 89 million related to the closure of its leased hayward california facility 

 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 applied’s board of directors approved a plan the plan to cease development of beamline implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the operations of its implant group based in horsham england pursuant to the plan applied closed its research development and manufacturing operations in horsham in october 2007 the total cost of implementing the plan is expected to be in the range of 95 million to 110 million and is reported in the consolidated statements of operations under cost of 

products sold and operating expenses including restructuring and asset impairment charges the majority of the cash outlays in connection with the plan occurred in fiscal 2007 

 

costs under the plan in fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of inventoryrelated charges reported as cost of products sold of 56 million other operating expenses of 10 million and restructuring and asset impairment charges of 30 million also as part of the plan applied recorded restructuring charges of 22 million consisting primarily of employee termination costs to reduce its workforce by approximately 215 positions the majority of the affected employees were based in horsham england and represented multiple functions asset impairment charges included 8 million of fixed asset writeoffs the implant group operated in the silicon segment and the results of its operations were not material to applied’s financial position or results of operations

net interest income 

 

net interest income was 98 million for fiscal 2007 149 million for fiscal 2006 and 134 million for fiscal 2005 

 

the decrease in net interest income from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in cash and investments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 when applied repurchased 145 million shares of outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 25 billion under an accelerated stock buyback program on january 24 2007 applied settled the price adjustment of 132 million relating to the accelerated stock buyback program by payment in cash to goldman sachs  co goldman sachs resulting in an adjusted price per share of 1808 the repurchase was funded with applied’s existing cash and investments a portion of the investment portfolio was sold to fund the accelerated stock buyback resulting in lower interest income in 2007 

 

the increase in net interest income from fiscal 2005 to 2006 was due primarily to increased interest rates combined with a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities in september 2004 and september 2005 

 

income taxes 

 

applied’s effective income tax provision rate was 299 percent for fiscal 2007 300 percent for fiscal 2006 and 235 percent for fiscal 2005 applied’s effective tax rate of 299 percent for fiscal 2007 reflected benefits of 36 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income tax filings partially offset by a 13 million charge from the expensing of equitybased compensation applied’s effective tax rate of 300 percent for fiscal 2006 reflected benefits of 61 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income tax filings partially offset by a 17 million charge from the expensing of equitybased compensation applied’s effective rate of 235 percent for fiscal 2005 reflected the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income tax filings of 118 million and a change in estimate with respect to export tax benefits of 14 million partially offset by a charge of 32 million relating to the distribution of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs creation act 

 

applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income and nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly

on september 18 2006 applied entered into accelerated stock buyback agreements with goldman sachs under which applied agreed to repurchase from goldman sachs shares of applied’s outstanding common stock for an initial purchase price of 25 billion under the agreements applied purchased 145 million shares of its common stock on september 18 2006 at a price per share of 1720 and goldman sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the following four months at the end of the four month period applied was entitled or subject to a price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of applied common stock during the purchase period on january 24 2007 applied settled the price adjustment of 132 million by payment in cash to goldman sachs resulting in an adjusted price per share of 1808 the repurchase was funded with applied’s existing cash and investments the repurchased shares were reported as treasury stock 

 

at october 28 2007 cash and cash equivalents included an aggregate investment of 147 million in an enhanced cash fund the “fund” during the period between october 29 2007 and december 6 2007 applied redeemed net 61 million of its investment in the fund at par value net of interim transactions on december 6 2007 the fund’s manager notified applied that 1 cash redemptions were temporarily suspended although redemptions could be fulfilled through a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities consisting principally of high quality corporate debt mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities 2 the fund’s valuation will be based on the market value of the underlying securities whereas historically the fund’s valuation was based on amortized cost and 3 interest would continue to accrue the estimated carrying value of applied’s investment in the fund at december 6 2007 was 86 million and is not considered a cash equivalent due to the suspension of fund redemptions applied expects to receive a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities in the fund applied anticipates that this redemption will not result in a significant loss the securities received on redemption will be subject to changes in value depending on market conditions 

 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended october 28 2007 see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

during the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by applied or its subsidiaries as of october 28 2007 the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 194 million applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below that required applied to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 

 

applied also has operating leases for various facilities total rental expense for operating leases was 62 million for fiscal 2007 70 million for fiscal 2006 and 87 million for fiscal 2005 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 28 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the 

application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies 

 

warranty costs 

 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

inventory valuation 

 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

goodwill and intangible assets 

 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

income taxes 

 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 

 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

legal matters 

 

applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims either asserted or unasserted that arise in the ordinary course of business applied evaluates among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss significant judgment is required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated when applied determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty applied does not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations however significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

equitybased compensation — employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans 

 

beginning on october 31 2005 applied began accounting for stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas 123r which requires recognition of the fair value of equitybased compensation the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas 123r including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award the fair value of equitybased compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award and applied has elected to use the straightline method prior to the implementation of sfas 123r applied accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb 25 and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure — an amendment of fasb statement no 123” which amended sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements were estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of applied’s common stock at the date of grant see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

at october 28 2007 applied’s investment portfolio included fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 26 billion applied’s primary objective for investing in fixedincome securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 28 2007 and october 29 2006 an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 31 million and 28 million respectively while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired 

 

all of applied’s debt bears interest at fixed rates therefore an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen euro israeli shekel and swiss francs applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within 

12 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied’s results of operations for fiscal 2005 2006 or 2007 

 

forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen euro israeli shekel and swiss francs and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions applied’s outstanding forward exchange contracts are markedtomarket see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged therefore the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions the effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations applied’s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option premiums paid for options outstanding at october 28 2007 were not material

disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report management of applied conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of applied’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of applied’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act based upon that evaluation applied’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that applied’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report in ensuring that information required to be disclosed was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by applied in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   applied’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of applied’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer management of applied conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of applied’s internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on that evaluation applied’s management concluded that applied’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of october 28 2007 

 

kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and as part of the audit has issued a report included herein on the effectiveness of applied’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 28 2007 

changes in internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect applied’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting it should be noted that any system of controls however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met in addition the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

the stockholders and board of directors applied materials inc 

 

we have audited applied materials inc and subsidiaries’ the company internal control over financial reporting as of october 28 2007 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting included in item 9a our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion applied materials inc and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 28 2007 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of applied materials inc and subsidiaries as of october 28 2007 and october 29 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended october 28 2007 in connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements we have also audited the financial statement schedule as of and for each of the years in the threeyear period ended october 28 2007 our report dated december 14 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

 item 1 business tableend  

organized in 1967 applied a delaware corporation develops manufactures markets and services fabrication equipment for the worldwide semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries customers for these products include manufacturers of semiconductor chips and wafers flat panel displays and other electronic devices such as solar photovoltaic pv cells these customers use what they manufacture in their own products or sell them to other companies for use in advanced electronic components 

 

during fiscal 2006 applied made certain changes to its internal financial reporting structure and as a result is reporting four segments silicon fab solutions display and adjacent technologies a summary of net sales operating income depreciationamortization capital expenditures and assets for reportable segments is found in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements a discussion of factors potentially affecting applied’s operations is set forth under “risk factors” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

silicon segment 

 

applied’s silicon segment comprises a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips applied currently offers systems that perform most of the primary steps in the chip fabrication process including atomic layer deposition ald chemical vapor deposition cvd physical vapor deposition pvd electrochemical plating ecp etch ion implantation rapid thermal processing rtp chemical mechanical planarization cmp wafer wet cleaning wafer metrology and inspection and systems that etch measure and inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process 

 

most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components such as transistors and other devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring interconnects to build a chip the transistors capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove successive film layers similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer as the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing power in the same or smaller area the complexity of building the chip also increases necessitating more process steps to form smaller structures and more intricate wiring schemes a typical simplified process sequence for building the wiring portion of chips involves initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a cvd system an etch system is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer to form the metal wiring these openings and patterns are subsequently filled with conducting material using pvd andor ecp technologies a cmp step then polishes the wafer to achieve a flat surface additional deposition etch and cmp steps are then performed to build up the layers of wiring needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements to form the chip advanced chip designs require about 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle 

 

over time the semiconductor industry has migrated to increasingly larger wafers to build chips the predominant wafer size used for volume production today is 200 millimeter mm or eightinch wafers but a substantial number of advanced fabs now use 300mm or 12inch wafers to gain the economic advantages of a larger surface area the majority of new fab capacity is 300mm applied offers a comprehensive range of systems and through its fab solutions segment products and services to support 200mm and 300mm wafer processing 

 

a majority of process steps used in chipmaking are performed to build the interconnect a complex matrix of microscopic wires that carry electrical signals to connect the transistor and capacitor components of a chip while some customers are still using aluminum as the main conducting material for the interconnect many have transitioned to copper copper has lower resistance than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing copperbased chips and supplies systems for depositing etching and planarizing the copper interconnect layers 

 

complementing the transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low dielectric constant low k films to replace silicon dioxide material as the insulator between the copper wiring structures applied leads the industry in providing low k dielectric systems to chip manufacturers and many of these customers use the company’s

patents and licenses 

 

management believes that applied’s competitive position is significantly dependent upon its skills in research development engineering manufacturing and marketing and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the united states and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a substantial number of patents in the united states and other countries and additional applications are pending for new developments although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in its best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied for the life of the 

patents applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from and paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material in relation to applied’s consolidated results of operations 

 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in dealing with such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms if applied is not able to resolve or settle claims obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

environmental matters 

 

two of applied’s locations have been designated as environmental cleanup sites in 1987 the united states environmental protection agency designated one of the locations in santa clara california as a superfund site and named applied as a “responsible party” cleanup activities at this site began in 1984 and were substantially completed in february 2002 the california regional water quality control board designated applied as a “discharger” with respect to another site in sunnyvale california applied was named a discharger upon its acquisition of the property in 1997 solely due to its status as property owner the prior owners of the site andor operators who caused the contamination are responsible for performing cleanup and monitoring activities in addition applied has become aware of soil and groundwater contamination at levels exceeding regulatory requirements at its facility in narita japan which it believes was caused by a former owner or operator of the property applied is continuing its investigation of the contamination and is working with local authorities to determine what further action may be required 

 

applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance and periodically conducts investigations of possible contamination 

 

compliance with federal state and local provisions regulating discharge of materials into the environment remedial agreements and other actions relating to the environment have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment its future success depends on many factors including the effective development commercialization and customer acceptance of its nanomanufacturing technology equipment service and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including enhancing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets and cultivating new markets and new business models while constantly improving its operational performance the development introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more varied competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time applied’s success is subject to many risks including but not limited to its ability to timely costeffectively and successfully 1 improve and develop new applications for existing products and increase market share in its existing markets 2 develop appropriately price and achieve market acceptance of new products 3 expand into or develop related and new markets for its nanomanufacturing technology 4 anticipate and capitalize on opportunities in new markets such as solar and with new technologies 5 supply a range of applied and nonapplied products as part of its solar offerings 6 appropriately allocate resources including rde funding among applied’s products and between the development of new products and the improvement of existing products 7 accurately forecast demand and meet production schedules for its products 8 achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings 9 adapt to technology changes in related markets such as lithography 10 develop market and price similar products for use by customers in different applications andor markets that may have varying technical requirements 11 adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain 12 qualify products for volume manufacturing with its customers 13 implement changes in its design engineering methodology including those that enable significant decreases in material costs and cycle time greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems and effective product life cycle management 14 improve its manufacturing processes and 15 deploy initiatives to transform applied’s information technology systems and enhance business processes including transitioning to a singlevendor enterprise resource planning erp software system furthermore new or improved products may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies compared to applied’s more established products and could adversely affect applied’s gross margins also entry into new markets entails additional challenges including those arising from changes in applied’s customer andor supplier base in addition applied must regularly reassess the size capability and location of its global infrastructure and timely make appropriate changes in its real estate and facilities portfolio if applied does not successfully manage these challenges its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

 

in fiscal 2006 more than 80 percent of applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states certain of applied’s rde and manufacturing facilities as well as suppliers to applied are also located outside the united states managing applied’s global operations presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 1 varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands 2 global trade issues 3 variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights in different countries 4 fluctuating raw material and energy costs 5 variations in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses 6 changes in laws and regulations of the united states including export restrictions and other countries as well as their interpretation and application 7 fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 8 the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations 9 political instability natural disasters such as earthquakes floods or storms pandemics terrorism or acts of war where applied has operations suppliers or sales 10 cultural differences 11 special customer or governmentsupported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors and 12 shipping costs andor delays many of these challenges are present in china which is experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and prospective 

competitors to applied and which applied believes presents a large potential market for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term these challenges as well as global uncertainties with respect to 1 economic growth rates in various countries 2 consumer confidence 3 the sustainability timing rate and amount of demand for electronics products and integrated circuits 4 capital and operational spending by semiconductor and display manufacturers and 5 price trends for certain integrated circuit devices may materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

 

applied’s customer base is and has historically been highly concentrated orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s net sales in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year moreover certain customers particularly in emerging areas such as solar may have capital resource constraints andor a limited operating history if customers do not place orders or they delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant non recoverable costs major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied in addition certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes andor formed strategic alliances or collaborative efforts which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

 

applied’s business depends on its ability to supply equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers some key parts may be subject to long leadtimes andor obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers in developing regions including china in addition applied has implemented several key operational initiatives intended to improve manufacturing efficiency including integratetoorder modulefinaltest and mergeintransit programs applied has also begun a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes that includes transitioning to a singlevendor enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions such as order management and manufacturing control significant interruptions of manufacturing operations or the delivery of services as a result of 1 the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts 2 volatility in the availability and cost of materials 3 difficulties or delays in obtaining required export approvals 4 information technology or infrastructure failures 5 difficulties and costs related to planning or effecting business process changes and implementing a new erp system 6 natural disasters such as earthquakes floods or storms or 7 other causes such as regional economic downturns pandemics political instability terrorism or acts of war could result in delayed deliveries manufacturing inefficiencies increased costs or order cancellations moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the failure to successfully implement and conduct offshoring and outsourcing activities could adversely affect results of operations

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

 

applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions changes in applied’s management or leadership competitors’ hiring practices and the effectiveness of applied’s compensation programs including its equitybased programs applied regularly evaluates its overall compensation program and makes adjustments as appropriate to enhance its competitiveness such as instituting broadbased grants of restricted stock units in fiscal 2006 if applied does not successfully attract retain and motivate key employees applied’s ability to capitalize on its opportunities and its operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

 

changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results 

 

as a global company applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors including changes in the 1 applicable tax laws 2 composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or 3 valuation of applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in addition applied is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals which could materially and adversely affect applied’s results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

introduction 

 

management’s discussion and analysis mda is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied’s business and results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with applied’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report the following discussion contains forward — looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this annual report on form 10k mda consists of the following sections 

 

  

overview 

 

applied develops manufactures markets and services semiconductor and semiconductorrelated fabrication equipment providing nanomanufacturing technology tm solutions to the global semiconductor flat panel display solar and other industries product development and manufacturing activities occur in north america europe and israel applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold through a direct sales force customer demand for spare parts and services is fulfilled through a global spare parts distribution system and trained service engineers located around the world in close proximity to customer sites 

 

as a supplier to these industries applied’s results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for chips and flat panel displays which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products the industries in which applied operates are volatile and its results in fiscal 2004 through 2006 reflect this volatility 

 

the following table presents certain significant measurements of the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

operating results for fiscal 2004 reflected a recovery from a downturn in the semiconductor industry and the global economy as well as realized savings from applied’s fiscal 2003 realignment activities in addition applied gained market share in critical areas including 300mm equipment and copper interconnect and improved its operational efficiencies 

 

fiscal 2005 results reflected a challenging environment as applied’s customers decreased fab utilization globally and reduced or delayed capital expenditures as a result of excess inventories and slowing demand for chips in this period applied focused on lowering costs improving efficiencies reducing cycle time and bringing new products to market during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 customer demand for applied products began to increase 

customer demand further improved in fiscal 2006 resulting in higher orders and revenue fiscal 2006 results reflected a recovery in the semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries and the global economy as enduser demand for electronic products and flat panel displays drove increased customer requirements for advanced silicon and display products during this period applied’s semiconductor customers increased both highvolume production and leadingedge 65nm and 45nm chip development results for this period also reflected applied’s continued focus on cost controls improvements in operating performance were offset in part by restructuring and asset impairment charges associated with real estate and facilities disinvestment that commenced during the first fiscal quarter equitybased compensation expenses and an inprocess research and development expense associated with the acquisition of applied films corporation applied films 

 

during the second half of fiscal 2006 applied completed certain transactions in support of its longterm growth strategy management believes that these transactions will enhance applied’s ability to extend its nanomanufacturing capabilities into adjacent and new markets including color filters for flat panel displays solar cells flexible electronics energyefficient glass and track solutions for semiconductor manufacturing these transactions included the acquisition of applied films the formation of a joint venture with dainippon screen mfg co ltd screen and the purchase of certain parts cleaning and recycling assets in singapore from ums solutions pte ltd ums solutions a whollyowned subsidiary of norelco ums holdings limited 

 

applied’s longterm opportunities depend in part on successful execution of its growth strategy including increasing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets and cultivating new markets and new business models these opportunities are also subject to many factors including 1 global economic conditions 2 advanced technology andor capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers and their capital investment trends 3 the profitability of chip and display manufacturers 4 supply and demand for chips flat panel displays solar panels and related products and services 5 realization of the anticipated benefits of business combinations 6 continued investment in research development and engineering rde and 7 the relative competitiveness of applied’s equipment and service products for these and other reasons set forth in part 1 item 1a “risk factors” applied’s prior results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

 

results of operations 

 

net sales 

 

applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2004 2005 and 2006 as a result of these conditions there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales both within and across the fiscal years demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip and flat panel supply and demand and other factors including rapid technological advances in fabrication processes 

quarterly and full fiscal year financial information was as follows 

 

 

 

net sales by geographic region which were attributed to the location of customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

new orders increased to 90 billion for fiscal 2004 reflecting a broadbased increase in capital investment in 300mm technology to meet rising demand for chips and flat panel displays following the new order trends net sales increased to 80 billion in fiscal 2004 reflecting the fulfillment of higher levels of orders for capital equipment received in prior quarters to support customers’ manufacturing capacity expansion and new technology requirements 

 

new orders for fiscal 2005 decreased 29 percent from 90 billion in the prior year to 64 billion as semiconductor manufacturers reduced their capital investments to align inventories with demand following the trend of decreasing orders during fiscal 2005 net sales decreased by 13 percent from 80 billion for fiscal 2004 to 70 billion for fiscal 2005 reflecting lower demand for semiconductor products 

new orders for fiscal 2006 increased 55 percent from 64 billion in the prior year to 99 billion as customer demand increased following the trend of increasing orders during fiscal 2006 net sales increased by 31 percent from 70 billion for fiscal 2005 to 92 billion for fiscal 2006 

 

gross margin 

 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from 462 percent for fiscal 2004 to 441 percent for fiscal 2005 and increased to 468 percent for fiscal 2006 the higher gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004 was principally attributable to improved revenue levels changes in product mix decreased product costs and increased manufacturing volume resulting in higher absorption of manufacturing and field service costs and the completion of refocused product efforts the higher gross margin in fiscal 2004 was partially offset by increased variable compensation costs as a result of improved operating performance the decrease in gross margin from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was due to lower revenue levels lower manufacturing absorption and changes in product mix which were partially offset by initiatives for cost reduction and efficiency improvement such as common platform architecture and parts lower cost sourcing and cycle time reduction the increase in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was principally attributable to the combination of higher revenue levels decreased product costs and increased manufacturing volume and absorption partially offset by increased variable and equitybased compensation costs applied began recognizing expenses associated with stock options and the espp in fiscal 2006 gross margin during fiscal 2006 included 37 million of equitybased compensation expense

substantial increase in interest rates combined with a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities in september 2004 and september 2005 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 applied repurchased 145 million shares of outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 25 billion under an accelerated buyback program the repurchase was funded with applied’s existing cash and investments a portion of the investment portfolio was sold to fund the accelerated stock buyback resulting in lower interest income due to the realization of losses associated with certain investments and a reduced investment portfolio 

 

income taxes 

 

applied’s effective income tax provision rate was 261 percent for fiscal 2004 235 percent for fiscal 2005 and 300 percent for fiscal 2006 applied’s effective rate of 235 percent for fiscal 2005 reflected the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income tax filings of 118 million and a change in estimate with respect to export tax benefits of 14 million partially offset by a charge of 32 million relating to the distribution of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs creation act applied’s effective tax rate of 300 percent for fiscal 2006 reflected benefits of 61 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income tax filings partially offset by a 17 million charge from the expensing of equitybased compensation 

 

the jobs creation act enacted in fiscal 2004 provides for a three year phaseout of current extraterritorial income tax eti benefits and replaces eti with a phasedin nine percent domestic production activity deduction that will not be fully effective until 2010 the jobs creation act will not fully replace applied’s current eti tax benefits 

 

applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income and nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

 

applied’s cash cash equivalents and investments decreased from 60 billion at october 30 2005 to 32 billion at october 29 2006 due primarily to share repurchases and cash dividend distributions applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years 

 

cash cashequivalents and investments consist of the following 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2006 applied changed its accounting method for certain fixedincome investments which resulted in the reclassification of these investments from shortterm investments to longterm investments as a result prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation this accounting method is based on the contractual maturity dates of fixedincome securities as current or longterm while the prior classification was based on the nature of the securities and the availability for use in current operations applied believes this presentation method is preferable as it is more reflective of applied’s assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash accordingly certain fixedincome investments of 26 billion have been reclassified from shortterm investments to longterm investments in the october 30 2005 consolidated balance sheet to conform to the fiscal 2006 financial statement presentation in connection with this reclassification shortterm deferred taxes have been reclassified to longterm deferred taxes there have been no changes in applied’s investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting method in addition 50 million of longterm equity securities previously reported in other longterm assets have been reclassified to longterm investments in the october 30 2005 consolidated balance sheet to conform to the fiscal 2006 financial statement presentation applied continues to classify auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes as current assets notwithstanding the underlying contractual term of such investments since the highly liquid nature of these investments enables them to be readily convertible to cash 

 

applied generated cash from operating activities of 16 billion for fiscal 2004 12 billion for fiscal 2005 and 19 billion for fiscal 2006 the primary sources of cash from operating activities have been net income as adjusted to exclude the effect of noncash charges including depreciation amortization equitybased compensation asset impairments and restructuring and iprd expenses and changes in working capital levels including accounts receivable and inventories applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of 859 million for fiscal 2004 158 million for fiscal 2005 and 245 million for fiscal 2006 the sales of these accounts receivable increased cash and reduced accounts receivable and days sales outstanding days sales outstanding were 69 days at the end of fiscal 2004 compared to 85 days at the end of fiscal 2005 and 80 days at the end of fiscal 2006 a portion of these sold accounts receivable is subject to certain limited recourse provisions however applied has not experienced any losses under these programs availability and usage of these accounts receivable sale agreements depend on many factors including the willingness of financial institutions to purchase receivables and the cost of such arrangements the decrease in days sales outstanding in fiscal 2006 is primarily related to the change in the regional sales mix and 

the resulting relative increase in the amount of sold accounts receivable for further details regarding accounts receivable sales see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements inventories increased by 373 million in fiscal 2006 which related to the increase in business volume and sales activity from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended october 29 2006 see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

during the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by applied or its subsidiaries as of october 29 2006 the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 114 million applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 

 

applied also has operating leases for various facilities total rental expense for operating leases was 88 million for fiscal 2004 87 million for fiscal 2005 and 70 million for fiscal 2006

on july 20 2006 applied and screen completed the formation of sokudo a japanese joint venture company to deliver advanced track solutions for customers’ critical semiconductor manufacturing requirements screen owns 52 percent and holds the controlling interest in sokudo and applied owns 48 percent screen transferred into sokudo its existing track business and related intellectual property including employees products and its installed base of systems applied paid 147 million for its investment in sokudo additionally applied contributed to sokudo certain technology and related intellectual property and will provide key development employees screen performs manufacturing for sokudo under an outsourcing agreement applied accounts for its interest in sokudo under the equity method of accounting under this accounting method applied’s exposure to loss from ongoing 

operations is limited to 144 million as of october 29 2006 which represents applied’s carrying value of its investment in sokudo applied’s investment in sokudo is classified as an equitymethod investment on the consolidated balance sheet 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled “risk factors” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies 

 

warranty costs 

 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

inventory valuation 

 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

income taxes 

 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 

 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

equitybased compensation — employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans 

 

beginning on october 31 2005 applied began accounting for stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares under the provisions of sfas 123r which requires recognition of the fair value of equitybased compensation the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas 123r including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award the fair value of equitybased compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award and applied has elected to use the straightline method applied makes quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in the consolidated condensed statements of operations prior to the implementation of sfas 123r applied accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of apb 25 and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure — an amendment of fasb statement no 123” which amended sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements were estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of applied’s common stock at the date of grant see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

legal matters 

 

applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims either asserted or unasserted that arise in the ordinary course of business applied evaluates among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss significant judgment is required in both the probability 

determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated when applied determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty applied does not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations however significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

at october 29 2006 applied’s investment portfolio included fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 24 billion applied’s primary objective for investing in fixedincome securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 29 2006 and october 30 2005 an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 28 million and 65 million respectively while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired 

 

applied’s longterm debt bears interest at fixed rates as such applied’s interest expense would increase only to the extent that applied significantly increased the amount of variable rate obligations outstanding due to the shortterm nature and relatively low amount of applied’s variable rate obligations an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen british pound euro and israeli shekel applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied’s results of operations for fiscal 2004 2005 or 2006 

 

forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen british pound euro and israeli shekel and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions applied’s outstanding forward exchange contracts are markedtomarket see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged therefore the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions the effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations applied’s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option premiums paid for options outstanding at october 29 2006 were not material

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

the stockholders and board of directors applied materials inc 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in item 9a controls and procedures that applied materials inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 29 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso applied materials inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that applied materials inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 29 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by coso also in our opinion applied materials inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 29 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by coso

 item 1 business 

 

organized in 1967 applied a delaware corporation develops manufactures markets and services integrated circuit fabrication equipment for the worldwide semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industry customers for these products include semiconductor wafer manufacturers and integrated circuit manufacturers including those that produce chips and flat panel displays which either use the integrated circuits they manufacture in their own products or sell them to other companies for use in advanced electronic components 

 

integrated circuit manufacturing 

 

most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components such as transistors and other devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring interconnects as the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing power in the same or smaller area the complexity of building the chip also increases necessitating the formation of smaller structures and more intricate wiring schemes to build a chip the transistors capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove successive film layers similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer a typical simplified process sequence for building the wiring portion of chips involves initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a chemical vapor deposition cvd system an etch system is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer to form the metal wiring these openings and patterns are subsequently filled with conducting material using physical vapor deposition pvd andor electrochemical plating ecp technologies a chemical mechanical polishing cmp step then polishes the wafer to achieve a flat surface additional deposition etch and cmp steps are then performed to build up the layers of wiring needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements to form the chip advanced chip designs require about 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle 

 

applied currently manufactures systems that perform most of the primary steps in the chip fabrication process including atomic layer deposition ald cvd pvd ecp etch ion implantation rapid thermal processing rtp cmp wafer wet cleaning wafer metrology and inspection and systems that etch measure and inspect 

circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process applied also provides products and services to enhance integrated circuit manufacturing productivity and yield 

 

most of applied’s products are singlewafer systems with multiple process chambers attached to a base platform each wafer is processed separately in its own environment allowing precise process control while the system’s multiple chambers enable simultaneous high productivity manufacturing applied sells most of its singlewafer multichamber systems on four basic platforms the centura® the endura® the producer® and the vantage® these platforms currently support ald cvd pvd etch and rtp technologies 

 

historically the semiconductor industry has migrated to increasingly larger wafers to build chips the predominant wafer size used for volume production today is 200mm or eightinch wafers but a substantial number of new fabs being built use 300mm or 12inch wafers to gain the economic advantages of a larger surface area applied offers a comprehensive line of systems and services to support 200mm and 300mm wafer processing 

 

a majority of process steps used in chipmaking are performed to build the interconnect a complex matrix of microscopic wires that carry electrical signals to connect the transistor and capacitor components of a chip many customers have transitioned from using aluminum as the main conducting material for the interconnect to copper which has lower resistance than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing copperbased chips and supplies systems for depositing etching and planarizing the copper interconnect layers in 2005 applied launched an enhanced pvd system for depositing the critical copper interconnect barrierseed layers in nextgeneration chips 

 

complementing the transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low dielectric constant low k films to replace silicon dioxide material as the insulator between the copper wiring structures applied leads the industry in providing low k dielectric systems to integrated circuit manufacturers and many of these customers are now using the company’s applied black diamond® film in volume production applied introduced its secondgeneration low k dielectric film this year the applied producer black diamond ii which further reduces the dielectric constant to enhance the speed of customers’ 65 nanometer nm and below chip designs 

 

the transistor portion of the chip is another area in which integrated circuit manufacturers are advancing their device designs to improve speed applied introduced several new products during fiscal 2005 for building smaller and faster transistors expanding its offerings in rapid thermal processing rtp and silicon etching 

 

applied also uses similar technologies to manufacture and service equipment used to fabricate flat panel displays fpds through its whollyowned subsidiary akt inc akt these systems are used by fpd manufacturers to build and test thin film transistor liquid crystal display tftlcd panels for televisions computer displays and other applications 

 

products 

 

the following summarizes applied’s portfolio of products and their associated process technology areas 

 

deposition 

 

deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating an integrated circuit during deposition a layer of dielectric material used as insulation barrier or electrically conductive typically metal materials used to carry current film is deposited or grown on a wafer applied currently provides equipment to perform the four main types of deposition ald cvd pvd and ecp in addition applied’s rtp systems can be used to perform certain types of dielectric deposition 

 

atomic layer deposition 

 

ald is an emerging technology in which single layers of atoms are used to build chip structures this technology enables customers to deposit thin layers of either conducting or insulating material with uniform coverage in subnanometer sized areas applied offers ald chambers for depositing tungsten and tantalum nitride films the applied endura icubs tm product is the industry’s first system to integrate ald and pvd chambers on a single platform for depositing critical barrier and seed layers in copper interconnects the applied centura 

isprint tm tungsten system isprint combines an ald chamber which deposits a tungsten nucleation film with a cvd tungsten bulk fill process in one system the isprint is used to form contact structures that connect the transistors to the wiring areas of the chip 

 

chemical vapor deposition 

 

cvd is used by customers to deposit dielectric and metal films on a wafer during the cvd process gases that contain atoms of the material to be deposited react on the wafer surface forming a thin film of solid material films deposited by cvd may be silicon oxide singlecrystal epitaxial silicon amorphous silicon silicon nitride dielectric antireflective coatings low k dielectric highly efficient insulating materials high k dielectric electrical chargestoring materials aluminum titanium titanium nitride polysilicon tungsten refractory metals or silicides applied offers the following cvd products and technologies 

 

the applied producer cvd system — this highthroughput platform features twinchamber modules that have two singlewafer process chambers per unit up to three twinchamber modules can be mounted on each producer platform giving it a maximum simultaneous processing capacity of six wafers many dielectric cvd processes can be performed on this platform the applied producer advanced patterning film tm process is an innovative cvd hardmask film that enables customers to fabricate sub50nm transistor gates and contact structures using standard lithography the applied producer darc® 193 deposits a dielectric antireflective coating that provides the precise dimensional control and compatibility needed for fabricating interconnects and transistors using advanced lithography methods 

 

the applied centura ultima hdpcvd® system — highdensity plasma cvd hdpcvd is used to fill very small deep spaces with dielectric film one of the processes that can be performed on the system is fluorinated silicate glass fsg a film with higher insulating value than traditionallyused silicon dioxide material that enables faster chip performance the applied centura ultima hdpcvd product is used by a number of major integrated circuit manufacturers for gapfill applications including the deposition of fsg in their advanced interconnect structures and deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation structures 

 

low k dielectric films — many integrated circuit manufacturers are now incorporating new low k dielectric materials in their copperbased chip designs to further improve interconnect speed the applied producer black diamond cvd low k system is being used by several customers in volume production to produce some of the industry’s most advanced devices using conventional cvd equipment the black diamond product provides customers with a proven costeffective way to transition to this new material in 2005 the applied producer black diamond ii was introduced — a secondgeneration dielectric that provides a lower kvalue film for building faster 65nm generation and below chip designs a complementary low k dielectric film called the applied producer blok tm barrier low k enables the complete multilayer dielectric structure to benefit from low k technology 

 

epitaxial deposition — epitaxial silicon epitaxy or epi is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality base for the device circuitry epi technology is used in an increasing number of integrated circuit devices in both the wafer substrate and transistor areas of a chip to enhance speed the applied centura epi system integrates pre and postepi processes on the same system to improve film quality and reduce production costs this system is also being used for silicongermanium epi technology which can reduce power usage and increase speed in certain types of advanced chips for emerging transistor designs the company’s applied centura rp epi system offers selective epi processes to enable faster transistor switching without the need to shrink the scale of the device 

 

polysilicon deposition — polysilicon is a type of silicon used to form portions of the transistor structure within the integrated circuit device the applied centura polygen tm lpcvd low pressure chemical vapor deposition system is a singlewafer multichamber product that deposits thin polysilicon films at high temperatures to create transistor gate structures to address the challenging requirements of 90nm and below devices the applied centura dpn gate stack system integrates chambers for decoupled plasma nitridation dpn rtp anneal and polysilicon deposition on one platform to enable superior film quality and material properties 

silicon nitride deposition — the applied centura singen® plus lpcvd system is a singlewafer hightemperature system that deposits silicon nitride films for transistor applications this system minimizes the amount of time the wafer is exposed to high temperatures and reduces particles while improving operating cost and productivity in critical transistor nitride layers for 130nm and below devices 

 

tungsten deposition — tungsten is used in the contact area of a chip that connects the transistors to the wiring circuitry in aluminumbased devices tungsten is also used in the structures that connect the multiple layers of aluminum wiring the company has two products for depositing tungsten the applied centura sprint® tungsten cvd system for 130nm and 90nm devices and the advanced applied centura isprint aldcvd system for 65nm and below applications the latter product combines ald technology and cvd chambers on the same platform 

 

physical vapor deposition 

 

pvd also called sputtering is a physical process in which atoms of a gas such as argon are accelerated toward a metal target the metal atoms chip off or sputter away and are then deposited on the wafer the applied endura pvd system offers a broad range of advanced deposition processes including aluminum aluminum alloys cobalt titaniumtitanium nitride tantalumtantalum nitride tungstentungsten nitride nickel nickel vanadium and copper cu the applied endura cubs copper barrierseed pvd system is widely used by customers for fabricating copperbased chips using pvd technology the system deposits critical layers that prevent copper material from entering other areas of the device and primes the structure for the subsequent deposition of bulk copper by electrochemical plating an enhanced version of the applied endura cubs system was announced in august 2005 to enable precise filling of the extremely high aspect ratio features found in 65nm devices with extendibility to 45nm chips and below 

 

the applied endura system’s highly flexible multichamber architecture allows the integration of multiple pvd processes or combinations of metal cvd and pvd technologies on the same system in addition to the integrated applied endura icubs aldpvd system discussed in the atomic layer deposition section the applied endura ilb tm integrated liner barrier system combines a pvd chamber for depositing titanium with a cvd chamber for titanium nitride deposition to form critical lining layers of interconnect structures these structures are subsequently filled with tungsten aluminum or other materials 

 

electrochemical plating 

 

electrochemical plating is a process by which metal atoms from a chemical fluid an electrolyte are deposited on the surface of an immersed object its main application in the semiconductor industry is to deposit copper in interconnect wiring structures this process step follows the deposition of barrier and seed layers which prevent the copper from contaminating other areas of the device and improve the adhesion of the copper film 

 

the applied slimcell tm ecp electrochemical plating system offers a smallvolume cell design that allows independent bath chemistry for multistep processing the system enables a reduction in defect levels compared to conventional large bath systems while reducing chemical consumption 

 

etch 

 

etching is used many times throughout the integrated circuit manufacturing process to selectively remove material from the surface of a wafer before etching begins the wafer is coated with a lightsensitive film called photoresist a photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern onto the wafer etching removes material only from areas dictated by the photoresist pattern applied offers a full range of systems for etching dielectric metal and silicon films to meet the requirements of sub100nm processing 

 

for dielectric applications the applied centura emax® system etches a broad range of dielectric films in the contact and interconnect regions of the chip applied’s producer etch system utilizes the twinchamber producer platform concept to target costsensitive dielectric etch applications in 90nm and below design geometries to address advanced low k etch applications the applied centura enabler® etch system performs etch strip and clean 

steps in a single chamber the enabler’s allinone capability streamlines the process flow for 65nm and below chip designs and significantly reduces operating costs 

 

the applied centura decoupled plasma source dps etch systems are used to etch conducting films such as metal and silicon materials and offer customers the technology productivity and reliability required for 100nm and below processing extending the dps technology to the next generation of silicon etching the applied centura advantedge tm system launched in july 2005 offers chipmakers high precision gate etching for 65nm and 45nmgeneration devices the applied centura transforma tm etch patterning system combines silicon etch technology with integrated metrology capability to enable customers to improve process control device yield and overall fab cycle time for building advanced transistor gate structures 

 

ion implantation 

 

during ion implantation silicon wafers are bombarded by a beam of ions called dopants that penetrate or implant the film surface to a desired depth the implantation step is used during transistor fabrication to change electrical properties of a material and achieve a particular electrical performance 

 

lowenergy high current implant technology is important to enabling the fabrication of smaller structures which contributes to faster transistor performance the applied quantum® x implanter provides chipmakers with a productionworthy singlewafer highcurrent implanter that enables transistor scaling to the 65nm node and below the quantum x system’s high tilt capability together with its precise energy control and low defect levels deliver the process technology needed to achieve the most difficult and critical implants required for 65nm and 45nm advanced manufacturing 

 

rapid thermal processing 

 

rtp subjects a wafer to rapid bursts of intense heat that can take the wafer from room temperature to more than 1000 degrees celsius in less than 10 seconds rtp is used mainly for modifying the properties of deposited films the applied centura radiance® plus and applied vantage radiance plus rtp systems feature the same advanced rtp technology with differing platform designs while the multichamber centura platform offers exceptional process flexibility the streamlined 2chamber vantage platform is designed for dedicated highvolume manufacturing these singlewafer rtp systems are also used for growing high quality oxide and oxynitride films deposition steps that traditional large batch furnaces can no longer achieve with the necessary precision and control for flash memory applications the company launched the applied vantage radox tm system which deposits highperformance gate oxides with high productivity and low operating cost 

 

chemical mechanical polishing 

 

cmp removes material from a wafer to create a flat planarized surface this process allows subsequent photolithography patterning steps to occur with greater accuracy and enables film layers to build with minimal height variations the company’s 200mm applied mirra® and mirra mesa® systems and 300mm applied reflexion® systems have led the industry in cmp technology with important features such as integrated cleaning film measurement and process control capabilities the company’s 300mm applied reflexion lk ecmp tm system features proprietary electrochemical mechanical planarization technology to provide a highperformance costeffective and extendible solution for copperlow k interconnects at the 65nm node and below the ecmp system removes bulk copper at a high rate by electric charge making it ideal for fragile ultralow k films 

 

metrology and wafer inspection 

 

applied offers several types of products that are used to measure and inspect the wafer during various stages of the fabrication process 

 

critical dimension and defect review scanning electron microscopes cdsems and drsems 

 

scanning electron microscopes sems use an electron beam to form images of microscopic features or critical dimensions cds of a integrated circuit wafer at extremely high magnification applied’s sems provide 

customers with full automation along with the high accuracy and sensitivity needed for measuring very small cds the applied veritysem tm metrology system uses proprietary sem imaging technology to enable precise control of the lithography and etching processes the veritysem measures transistor cds with less than 5 angstrom precision — a requirement for 45nm device production — and incorporates automation and software advancements for significantly higher throughput in production in february 2005 applied introduced its opc check software for the veritysem system using opc check the veritysem system performs automated qualification of opc optical proximity correction — based chip designs significantly reducing mask see mask making below verification time over conventional manual methods 

 

drsems review defects on the wafer such as particles scratches or residues that are first located by a defect detection system and then classify the defects to identify their source the highthroughput fully automatic applied semvision tm g2 defect analysis products enable customers to use this technology as an integral part of their production lines to analyze defects as small as 30nm with very high throughput the applied semvision g2 fib integrates advanced defect review sem capability with automated focused ion beam fib technology in one system the fib provides a crosssectional view of the defects reviewed by the sem enabling chipmakers to analyze the defects in minutes as part of their inline review process 

 

wafer inspection 

 

using laserbased technology defects can be detected on patterned wafers wafers with printed circuit images as they move between processing steps defects may include particles open circuit lines shorts between lines or other problems the applied complus2t tm inspection system detects defects in devices with design rules of 90nm and below incorporating key advances in imaging technology the system captures up to 50 percent more defects than the previous system with the high speed required for customers’ volume production lines in june 2005 the company announced its breakthrough entry into the large brightfield inspection market with the applied uvision tm inspection system the industry’s first laserbased 3d brightfield tool utilizing multibeam duv laser illumination and high efficiency detectors the uvision system uncovers critical defects on the wafer that have not been detected before by any other system enabling customers to rapidly resolve performancelimiting defect issues and achieve greater chip yields 

 

mask making 

 

masks are used by photolithography systems to transfer microscopic circuit designs onto wafers since an imperfection in a mask may be replicated on the wafer the mask must be virtually defectfree applied provides systems for etching measuring and inspecting masks the applied tetra ii mask etch system is based on the company’s productionproven dps wafer etch technology and is the industry’s most advanced etch tool for fabricating masks the applied reticle sem system built on applied’s proven cdsem platform measures virtually all mask types with sub1nm precision meeting the requirements of the industry’s most advanced masks 

 

flat panel display manufacturing 

 

flat panel displays are manufactured using integrated circuit technologies similar to those for making chips one significant difference is the vastly larger area of the substrate panel the panels can be in excess of 70 times larger in area than today’s largest wafers 300mm diameter new generation fpd fabs are being built primarily for manufacturing largearea flat panel liquid crystal display lcd television screens 

 

applied’s whollyowned subsidiary akt supplies plasmaenhanced cvd pecvd systems and electron beam array testers to fpd manufacturers applied offers a range of systems that can process and test different substrate sizes to meet the industry’s requirements for multiple fpd applications in response to the growing demand for lcd televisions applied introduced its latest pecvd system in fiscal 2005 the eighth generation gen8 akt50k pecvd tm  which addresses fpd fab requirements for substrates measuring approximately 22 meters by 24 meters the system can process up to six 52inch tv screens per substrate doubling the capacity of previous gen7 systems for the same screen size complementing its pecvd systems akt also offers electron beam test systems that test the substrates during production for defective pixels and other imperfections 

customer service and support

backlog 

 

applied’s backlog decreased from 34 billion at october 31 2004 to 26 billion at october 30 2005 applied manufactures its systems based on order backlog and customer commitments backlog includes only orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and shipment dates within 12 months have been assigned or where shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized in addition backlog includes contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months backlog adjustments for fiscal 2005 totaled 205 million which consisted of cancellations and currency and other adjustments customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business and results of operations 

 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

 

applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling various commercial and proprietary components into finished systems applied has significant manufacturing operations in austin texas santa clara california horsham england and rehovot israel manufacturing requires some raw materials including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components to be manufactured to applied’s specifications applied uses numerous companies to supply parts components and subassemblies parts for the manufacture and support of its products although applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers this is not always possible accordingly some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers applied has sought and will continue to seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by 1 qualifying and selecting alternate suppliers for key parts 2 monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers 3 maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts and 4 qualifying new parts on a timely basis 

 

research development and engineering 

 

applied’s longterm growth strategy requires continued development of new manufacturing products for integrated circuit fabrication applied’s significant investment in research development and engineering rde has generally enabled it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology selection cycle applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their 

planned technical and production requirements product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states as well as in the united kingdom and israel in addition applied outsources certain rde activities some of which are performed in other countries process support and customer demonstration laboratories are located in the united states the united kingdom and israel 

 

applied invested 921 million 21 percent of net sales for fiscal 2003 992 million 12 percent of net sales for fiscal 2004 and 941 million 13 percent of net sales for fiscal 2005 in rde for product development and engineering programs to create new product lines and improve existing technologies and products applied has spent an average of 16 percent of net sales on rde over the last five years in addition to rde for specific product technologies applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems materials research and environmental control that have applications to its products in fiscal 2005 applied focused on developing systems for customers’ new chip designs with 65nm and below geometries including systems to enable faster and denser transistor and interconnect structures 

 

marketing and sales 

 

because of the highly technical nature of its products applied markets and sells its products worldwide through a direct sales force for fiscal 2005 net sales to customers in each region as a percentage of applied’s total net sales were taiwan 23 percent north america primarily the united states 21 percent japan 20 percent korea 14 percent europe 13 percent and asiapacific including china 9 percent applied’s business is usually not seasonal in nature but it is cyclical based on the capital equipment investment patterns of major integrated circuit manufacturers these expenditure patterns are based on many factors including anticipated market demand and pricing for integrated circuits the development of new technologies factory utilization and global and regional economic conditions 

 

during fiscal 2005 approximately 80 percent of applied’s net sales were to regions outside of the united states managing applied’s global operations presents challenges and involves uncertainties that may affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations for further discussion see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — trends risks and uncertainties — applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business” 

 

information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and longlived assets attributable to applied’s geographic regions is included in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements during fiscal 2003 two customers individually accounted for greater than 10 percent of net sales net sales to intel corporation represented 13 percent of applied’s net sales and net sales to samsung america inc represented 12 percent of applied’s net sales during fiscal 2004 no individual customer accounted for more than 10 percent of applied’s net sales during 2005 samsung america inc accounted for 10 percent of applied’s net sales 

 

competition 

 

the global semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological advancements and demanding worldwide service requirements applied’s ability to compete primarily depends on its ability to commercialize its technology and continually improve its products processes and services as well as its ability to develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors for succeeding in the integrated circuit manufacturing equipment market include the product’s technical capability productivity and costeffectiveness and the level of technical service and support the importance of each of these factors varies depending on the specific customer’s needs including considerations such as the customer’s process application product requirements timing of the purchase and particular circumstances of the purchasing decision the pace of technological change is rapid with customers continually moving to smaller critical dimensions and larger wafer sizes and adopting new materials for fabricating chips existing technology can sometimes be adapted to the new requirements but some of these requirements may create the need for an entirely different technical approach the rapid pace of technological change creates opportunities for existing competitors and startups and can quickly diminish the value of existing technologies 

 

substantial competition exists for each of applied’s products competitors range from small companies that compete with a single product andor in a single region to global companies with multiple lines of integrated circuit 

manufacturing products management believes that applied has a strong competitive position based on the ability of its products and services to continue to address customer requirements success for applied requires a continued high level of investment in rde and in marketing sales and customer support activities 

 

patents and licenses 

 

management believes that applied’s competitive position is significantly dependent upon skills in research development engineering manufacturing and marketing and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights including patents is important therefore applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the us and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a significant number of patents in the us and other countries and additional applications are pending for new developments although applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights 

 

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in its best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied for the life of the patents applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from and paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material in relation to the consolidated results of operations 

 

in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in dealing with such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms if applied is not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of the matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

environmental matters 

 

two of applied’s locations have been designated as environmental cleanup sites in 1987 the united states environmental protection agency designated one of the locations in santa clara california as a superfund site and named applied as a “responsible party” cleanup activities at this site began in 1984 and were substantially completed in february 2002 the california regional water quality control board has designated applied as a “discharger” with respect to another site in sunnyvale california applied was named a discharger at the sunnyvale site upon its acquisition of the property in 1997 the prior owners and operators of the site are responsible for performing cleanup and monitoring activities applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature as part of these programs applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance and periodically conducts investigations of possible contamination neither compliance with federal state and local provisions regulating discharge of materials into the environment nor remedial agreements or other actions relating to the environment has had or is expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

introduction 

 

management’s discussion and analysis mda is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied’s business and results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with applied’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report mda consists of the following sections 

 

 16 

 

overview 

 

applied develops manufactures markets and services integrated circuit fabrication equipment for the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industry product development and manufacturing activities occur in north america the united kingdom and israel applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and as a result are sold through a direct sales force customer demand for spare parts and services is fulfilled through a global spare parts distribution system and trained service engineers located around the world in close proximity to customer sites 

 

as a supplier to this industry applied’s results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for integrated circuits which in turn depends on enduser demand for electronic products the industry in which the company operates is volatile the downturn that began in fiscal 2001 and continued into fiscal 2003 constituted what management believes to be the longest and most severe downturn experienced by the industry a recovery began in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 and continued into fiscal 2004 the growth peaked in the second half of 2004 and slowed thereafter through fiscal 2005 applied’s results in fiscal 2003 through 2005 reflect the volatility of the industry 

 

the following table presents certain significant measurements of the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2003 lower sales volume and under absorption of manufacturing and service costs resulted in lower gross margins in response to the continued difficult economic environment applied implemented a realignment plan in fiscal 2003 which concluded in the first fiscal quarter of 2004 fiscal 2003 operating results were negatively affected by lower net sales reduced gross margins and charges related to realignment activities 

 

operating results for fiscal 2004 reflected a recovery in the semiconductor industry and the global economy as well as applied’s realized savings from the completed realignment activities in addition applied gained market share in critical areas including 300mm equipment and copper interconnect improved operational efficiencies and further strengthened its cash position 

 

fiscal 2005 results reflected a challenging environment as applied’s customers decreased fab utilization globally and reduced or delayed capacity additions as a result of excess inventories and slowing demand for integrated circuits during this period applied focused on lowering costs improving efficiencies reducing cycle time and bringing new products to market applied also generated strong cash flow and returned value to stockholders by repurchasing stock and paying cash dividends 

 

applied’s longterm opportunities depend in part on successful execution of its growth strategy including increasing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets and cultivating new markets and new business models these opportunities are also subject to many factors including 1 global economic conditions 2 advanced technology andor capacity requirements of integrated circuit manufacturers and their capital investment trends 3 the profitability of integrated circuit manufacturers 4 supply and demand for integrated circuits 5 applied’s investment in rde and 6 the relative competitiveness of applied’s equipment and service products for this and other reasons set forth in the section entitled “trends risks and uncertainties” applied’s prior results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

results of operations 

 

applied’s fiscal year ends on the last sunday in october of each year fiscal 2005 and 2003 each contained 52 weeks whereas fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks the first fiscal quarter of 2005 and 2003 each contained 13 weeks whereas the first fiscal quarter of 2004 contained 14 weeks 

 

net sales 

 

applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2003 2004 and 2005 as a result of these conditions there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales both within and across the fiscal years demand for integrated circuit manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in integrated circuit supply and demand and other factors including rapid technological advances in integrated circuit fabrication processes 

 

quarterly and full fiscal year financial information was as follows 

 

 

net sales by geographic region which were attributed to the location of the customers’ facilities were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

from fiscal 2001 through the third quarter of 2003 slowing worldwide demand for integrated circuits resulted in a rapid decline in demand for integrated circuit manufacturing equipment inventory buildups in telecommunication products slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused integrated circuit companies to reduce their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders the decline in demand further deepened into a severe industry downturn due to continued weakness in the macroeconomic climate and reduced consumption of electronic products which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by applied’s customers however beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 and continuing into fiscal 2004 customers increased their investments in capital equipment for capacity and technology responding to higher spending for consumer electronics and business information technology and an increase in integrated circuit demand the growth peaked in the second half of 2004 and slowed thereafter into fiscal 2005 as a result of excess inventories and slowing demand for integrated circuits customers reduced production and delayed capacity additions in fiscal 2005 

 

new orders in the first half of 2003 declined to 10 billion per quarter reflecting the continued and prolonged downturn in the integrated circuit industry however new orders increased during the second half of 2003 reflecting customers’ continued investments in advanced memory and logic and transition to 300mm along with the increased capacity utilization in both advanced and established technologies following these new order trends net sales decreased to approximately 11 billion for each of the first three fiscal quarters of 2003 reflecting the impact of the industry downturn net sales increased to 12 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 indicating the beginning of an industry recovery net sales for fiscal 2003 were 45 billion 

 

new orders increased from 43 billion for fiscal 2003 to 90 billion for fiscal 2004 reflecting a broadbased increase in capital investment by both advanced memory and logic manufacturers for 300mm technology to meet rising demand for integrated circuits following the new order trends net sales increased 79 percent from 45 billion for fiscal 2003 to 80 billion for fiscal 2004 reflecting the fulfillment of higher levels of orders for capital equipment received in prior quarters to support customers’ manufacturing capacity expansion and new technology requirements 

 

new orders decreased 29 percent from 90 billion for fiscal 2004 to 64 billion for fiscal 2005 as integrated circuit manufacturers reduced their capital investments to bring inventories in line with demand following the trend of decreasing orders during fiscal 2005 net sales decreased by 13 percent from 80 billion for fiscal 2004 to 70 billion for fiscal 2005 reflecting lower demand for integrated circuit products 

 

realignment activities 

 

during fiscal 2003 in response to the continuing difficult business conditions applied implemented a series of activities to better align applied’s cost structure with prevailing economic conditions realignment activities consisted of consolidation of facilities reductions in workforce and refocused product efforts as a result of the 

realignment activities applied vacated approximately two million square feet and reduced approximately 3800 positions during fiscal 2003 realignment activities resulted in charges across multiple categories as incurred including cost of products sold rde expenses and restructuring and asset impairment charges during the first fiscal quarter of 2004 realignment activities were completed and reported as restructuring asset impairments and other charges as discussed below there were no realignment charges during fiscal 2005 

 

gross margin 

 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased from 358 percent for fiscal 2003 to 462 percent for fiscal 2004 and decreased to 441 percent for fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2000 applied experienced unprecedented new order and revenue growth accordingly applied expanded its manufacturing facilities to accommodate anticipated growth the lower business volume in fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003 due to the industry downturn was insufficient to fully absorb the overhead costs of these facilities resulting in lower gross margins for all respective periods the continued decline in gross margin for fiscal 2003 was principally attributable to under absorption of manufacturing and field service costs as a result of prolonged low business volumes and inventory writeoffs and charges associated with refocused product efforts the increase in gross margin from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was principally attributable to improved revenue levels changes in product mix decreased product costs and increased manufacturing volume resulting in higher absorption of manufacturing and field service costs and the completion of refocused product efforts discussed previously the improvement in gross margin was partially offset by increased variable compensation costs as a result of improved operating performance the decrease in gross margin from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was due to lower revenue levels lower manufacturing absorption and changes in product mix which were partially offset by initiatives for cost reduction and efficiency improvement such as common platform architecture and parts lower cost sourcing and cycle time reduction 

 

research development and engineering 

 

applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced integrated circuit designs applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies as a result rde expenses were 921 million 21 percent of net sales for fiscal 2003 992 million 12 percent of net sales for fiscal 2004 and 941 million 13 percent of net sales for fiscal 2005 development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product or a new product most of applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies materials and processes in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in its existing areas of development or through new product opportunities to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

 

in fiscal 2003 applied refocused its product efforts and made investments in strategic products applied concentrated on the development of several important processing technologies to enable the production of chips using copper and low k dielectric materials as well as to meet the challenges of smaller feature sizes such as 65nm and below in addition to interconnect solutions applied continued to invest resources in the development of systems for advanced transistor designs with smaller gate structures that enable faster signal propagation and reduced power applied also continued the development of its process diagnostic and control capabilities with systems to inspect and measure smaller dimensions and defects 

 

in fiscal 2004 applied continued its investment in developing technologies for future generation manufacturing advances were made in several key areas including technology for enhancing transistor and interconnect performance applied introduced ten major products in these areas including the endura2 ecmp quantum x and g2 fib systems all targeted for 65nm and below chip manufacturing in addition applied introduced the gen7 akt flat panel system 

 

in fiscal 2005 applied focused on developing systems for customers’ advanced chip designs including systems to enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures with 65nm 45nm and below geometries 

for copper interconnect applications the company introduced the applied endura cubs system with advanced copper barrierseed technology and the applied producer black diamond ii system for nextgeneration low k dielectric layers for leadingedge transistor gate applications applied launched the applied advantedge etch system and the applied vantage radox rtp new applications in strain engineering which involves creating localized areas of stress in the transistor structure were also developed for existing systems to meet customers’ requirements for faster transistors in the area of inspection and metrology applied launched uvision the industry’s first laser 3d brightfield inspection tool the applied opc check software is designed to automate critical opc mask verification for customers applied’s akt subsidiary developed the gen8 akt50k pecvd system for manufacturing flat panel displays the system processes 22m x 24m glass substrates and doubles the capacity of previous gen7 systems for producing 52inch lcdtv screens 

 

marketing selling general and administrative 

 

marketing selling general and administrative expenses were 626 million 14 percent of net sales for fiscal 2003 increased to 752 million 9 percent of net sales for fiscal 2004 and decreased to 697 million 10 percent of net sales for fiscal 2005 the increase from fiscal 2003 to 2004 correlated to the increase in business volume as well as increases in variable compensation as a result of improved operating performance the decrease from fiscal 2004 to 2005 was due to lower business volume reductions in variable compensation and applied’s continued focus on cost controls 

 

restructuring asset impairments and other charges 

 

the restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2003 and 2004 were intended to better align applied’s cost structure with prevailing market conditions due to the industry downturn at the time these actions which were necessary as a result of reduced business volume reduced applied’s global workforce and consolidated global facilities 

 

restructuring asset impairments and other charges for fiscal 2003 totaled 372 million consisting of 186 million for headcount reductions 86 million for consolidation of facilities and 100 million for other costs primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations 

 

restructuring asset impairments and other charges for fiscal 2004 totaled 167 million consisting of 65 million for facility consolidations 6 million for severance and benefits and 96 million for other costs primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations 

 

as of october 30 2005 the fiscal 2003 and 2004 restructuring actions have been completed and restructuring reserve balances consist principally of remaining lease commitments associated with facilities

litigation settlements net 

 

litigation settlements net were 27 million for fiscal 2004 and consisted of costs of 28 million related to two separate patent litigation settlements net of a gain of 1 million related to a legal settlement in favor of applied 

 

during fiscal 2003 or 2005 there were no significant litigation settlements 

 

net interest income 

 

net interest income was 102 million for fiscal 2003 66 million for fiscal 2004 and 134 million for fiscal 2005 the decrease in net interest income from fiscal 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to lower average portfolio yields the increase in net interest income in 2005 was due to a substantial increase in interest rates and a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities in september 2004 and september 2005 

 

income taxes 

 

applied’s effective income tax provisionbenefit rate was 295 percent for fiscal 2003 261 percent for fiscal 2004 and 235 percent for fiscal 2005 applied’s effective tax rate of 261 percent for fiscal 2004 differed from 295 percent for fiscal 2003 due to increased export tax benefits and foreign tax credits applied’s effective rate of 

235 percent for fiscal 2005 differed from 261 percent for fiscal 2004 primarily due to the favorable resolution of a multiyear internal revenue service irs tax examination of 118 million and a change in estimate with respect to export tax benefits of 14 million partially offset by a charge of 32 million relating to the distribution of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs creation act applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income and nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly 

 

in october 2004 the united states congress enacted the jobs creation act which provides for a three year phaseout of current extraterritorial income tax eti benefits and replaces eti with a phasedin nine percent domestic production activity deduction that will not be fully effective until 2010 the jobs creation act will not fully replace applied’s current eti tax benefits 

 

business combinations 

 

on june 28 2005 applied purchased certain assets of scp global technology inc scp consisting of singlewafer hflast immersion technology and marangoni cleandry intellectual property for approximately 24 million in cash 

 

on december 16 2004 applied acquired the assets of atmi inc’s treatment systems business ecosys which supports the gas abatement requirements of process equipment for integrated circuit manufacturing and other industrial applications for approximately 16 million in cash

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in may 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections — a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” sfas 154 which requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of every voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is impracticable to do so sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors beginning in fiscal 2007 applied does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on applied’s financial position or results of operations 

 

in march 2005 the sec released sec staff accounting bulletin no 107 sab 107 sab 107 provides the sec staff position regarding the application of sfas 123r “sharebased payment” sab 107 contains interpretive guidance relating to the interaction between sfas 123r and certain sec rules and regulations as well as the staff’s views regarding the valuation of sharebased payment arrangements for public companies sab 107 also highlights the importance of disclosures made related to the accounting for sharebased payment transactions applied is currently evaluating sab 107 and will be incorporating it as part of its adoption of sfas 123r in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased payments at fair value in april 2005 the sec extended the compliance requirement date of sfas 123r with the result that this requirement will be effective for applied beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 2006 applied is currently evaluating the expected impact of 

sfas 123r to its consolidated financial statements see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the pro forma effect on applied’s reported net income and net earnings per share of applying the fair value provisions of the sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to stockbased employee compensation 

 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas 151 sfas 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges sfas 151 will be effective in fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas 151 is not expected to have a material effect on applied’s financial position or results of operations 

 

in march 2004 the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” eitf 031 the guidance prescribes a threestep model for determining whether an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments the accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2004 while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after june 15 2004 in september 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf 0311 “effective date of paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 ‘the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” fsp eitf 0311 fsp eitf 0311 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue 031 in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain otherthantemporary investments” this fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired whether the impairment is otherthantemporary and the measurement of an impairment loss this statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 1018 of eitf 031 and references existing otherthantemporary impairment guidance the guidance under this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 applied continued to apply relevant “otherthantemporary” guidance as provided for in fsp eitf 0311 during fiscal 2005 applied does not expect the implementation of fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 will have a material effect on applied’s financial position or results of operations 

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

 

applied’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased from 66 billion at october 31 2004 to 59 billion at october 30 2005 due primarily to repurchases and cash dividend distributions applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years 

 

applied generated cash from operating activities of 855 million for fiscal 2003 16 billion for fiscal 2004 and 12 billion for fiscal 2005 the primary sources of cash from operating activities have been net income as adjusted to exclude the effect of noncash charges and changes in working capital levels including accounts receivable and inventories applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of 556 million for fiscal 2003 859 million for fiscal 2004 and 158 million for fiscal 2005 the sales of these accounts receivable increased cash and reduced accounts receivable and days sales outstanding days sales outstanding were 68 days at the end of fiscal 2003 compared to 69 days at the end of fiscal 2004 and 85 days at the end of fiscal 2005 a portion of these sold accounts receivable is subject to certain limited recourse provisions however applied has not experienced any losses under these programs availability and usage of these accounts receivable sale agreements depend on many factors including the willingness of financial institutions to purchase receivables and the cost of such arrangements the increase in days sales outstanding in fiscal 2005 is primarily related to the change in the regional sales mix and the resulting relative decrease in the amount of sold accounts receivable for further details regarding accounts receivable sales see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements inventories decreased by 105 million in fiscal 2005 which corresponds to the decrease in business volume and sales activity from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 

 

applied used 11 billion of cash for investing activities for fiscal 2003 534 million for fiscal 2004 and 179 million for fiscal 2005 capital expenditures were 265 million for fiscal 2003 191 million for fiscal 2004 and 200 million for fiscal 2005 totaling 656 million for the past three years application laboratories equipment and related facilities have comprised the majority of the capital spending fiscal 2003 capital expenditures also 

included 52 million for the purchase of facilities in hillsboro oregon that were previously held under a synthetic lease fiscal 2004 capital expenditures consisted principally of laboratory and demonstration equipment fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included investment in laboratory equipment and upgrades to applied’s enterprise resource planning software and network architecture investing activities also included purchases and sales of shortterm investments and acquisitions of technology or companies to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies during fiscal 2005 applied paid 102 million net of cash acquired for the metron and ecosys acquisitions as discussed in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

applied generated cash of 8 million from financing activities for fiscal 2003 used cash of 359 million for fiscal 2004 and used cash for 16 billion for 2005 financing activities included issuances and repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends since march 1996 applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to partially fund its stockbased employee benefit and incentive plans cash used to repurchase shares totaled 250 million for fiscal 2003 650 million for fiscal 2004 and 17 billion for fiscal 2005 beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2005 applied’s board of directors declared three consecutive quarterly cash dividends in the amount of 003 per share per declaration the first two declared cash dividends totaling 98 million were paid during fiscal 2005 the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the company’s financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt applied did not borrow any cash in fiscal years 2003 2004 or 2005 cash used for debt repayments totaled 64 million for fiscal 2003 105 million for fiscal 2004 and 62 million for fiscal 2005 cash generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to applied’s equity compensation programs totaled 323 million for fiscal 2003 397 million for fiscal 2004 and 266 million for fiscal 2005 

 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended october 30 2005 see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

during the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries as of october 30 2005 the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 60 million applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 

 

in 2001 applied formed applied materials ventures i lp the fund to invest in privatelyheld earlystage companies engaged in developing systems components and devices based on nanotechnology andor communications technology for specific applications and products the fund was a limited partnership with applied as the sole limited partner and an independent party as the general partner during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 applied exercised its right to limit capital contributions to the fund to 25 million and to elect to terminate the partnership as a result under the provisions of the partnership agreement the activities of the partnership concluded and the partnership was dissolved in march 2005 applied’s cumulative capital contributions to the fund totaled approximately 23 million through october 31 2004 and 24 million through october 30 2005 the fund’s assets which primarily consisted of shares of portfolio companies were distributed between applied and the general partner during fiscal 2005 see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on the fund 

 

applied also has operating leases for various facilities total rental expense for operating leases was 134 million for fiscal 2003 88 million for fiscal 2004 and 87 million for fiscal 2005 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes applied’s contractual obligations as of october 30 2005 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies as defined below 

 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations specifically these policies have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled “trends risks and uncertainties” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

management believes that the following are critical accounting policies 

 

warranty costs 

 

applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 

applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

inventory valuation 

 

inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

goodwill and intangible assets 

 

applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

income taxes 

 

applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 

 

the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied’s expectations could have a material impact on applied’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

legal matters 

 

applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims either asserted or unasserted that arise in the ordinary course of business applied evaluates among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable 

outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated when applied determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty applied does not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations however significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

trends risks and uncertainties 

 

the industry that applied serves is volatile and unpredictable 

 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industry applied is subject to the industry’s business cycles the timing length and volatility of which are difficult to predict the industry has historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand for integrated circuits and manufacturing capacity including capacity using the latest technology the effect on applied of these changes in demand including endcustomer demand is occurring more rapidly exacerbating the volatility of these cycles these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ capital equipment purchases and investments in technology and continue to affect applied’s orders net sales gross margin and results of operations 

 

applied must effectively manage its resources and production capacity to meet changing demand during periods of decreasing demand for integrated circuit manufacturing equipment applied must be able to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions effectively motivate and retain key employees and effectively manage its supply chain during periods of increasing demand applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and must be able to attract retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals and effectively manage its supply chain if applied is not able to timely and appropriately align its cost structure with business conditions andor to effectively manage its resources and production capacity including its supply chain during changes in demand applied’s business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the industry 

 

the industry is characterized by ongoing changes including 1 changes in customers’ capacity requirements capacity utilization and capital spending which depend in part on the demand for customers’ products and customers’ inventory levels relative to demand 2 the importance of reducing the cost of system ownership due in part to the increasing significance of consumer electronics as a driver for integrated circuit demand and the related focus on lower prices 3 varying levels of business information technology spending 4 increasingly complex technology requirements including a significant rise in the number and importance of new materials 5 the growing types and varieties of integrated circuits and applications 6 an expanding number of applications across multiple substrate sizes resulting in divergent demands among integrated circuit manufacturers 7 customers’ varying adoption rates of new technology 8 a rising percentage of business from customers in asia and the emergence of customers competitors and suppliers in new geographical regions 9 customer demands for shorter lead times for the manufacture and installation of integrated circuit manufacturing equipment 10 the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity 11 the effect on system demand as a result of the increasing productivity and reliability of integrated circuit manufacturing equipment 12 the increasing pace of changes in the mix of investments by customers in integrated circuit manufacturing equipment 13 customers’ increasing use of partnerships alliances joint ventures and industry consortia that has increased the influence of key integrated circuit manufacturers in technology decisions made by their global partners 14 higher capital requirements for new integrated circuit fabrication plants 15 the rising importance of speed of product development and timetomarket 16 the increasing difficulty for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing 17 the challenge to customers of moving volume manufacturing from one technology node to the next smaller technology node 18 the rate of growth in the industry 19 a heightening concern among certain us governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial andor security issues posed by the growing manufacturing business in asia especially china 20 the need to effectively manage a growing number of 

existing and new products in more varied competitive environments and 21 the increasing importance of operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets customers and applications these changes individually or in combination are increasing the need for customer partnering use of foundries collaborative research and development efforts and process integration support certain of these changes also heighten the importance of spare parts and service product offerings as a competitive advantage for integrated circuit equipment manufacturers even though service products typically result in lower gross margins than system products in response to these ongoing changes applied must regularly reassess the size capability and location of its global infrastructure if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes 

 

as applied operates in a highly competitive environment applied’s future success heavily depends on effective development commercialization and customer acceptance of its new equipment service and related products in addition applied must successfully execute its growth strategy including increasing market share in existing markets expanding into related markets and cultivating new markets and new business models while constantly improving its operational performance applied’s success is subject to many risks including but not limited to its ability to timely and costeffectively 1 develop and market new products and price products appropriately 2 improve existing products and increase market share in its existing markets 3 expand into or develop related and new markets for its technology 4 achieve market acceptance of and accurately forecast demand and meet production schedules for its products 5 achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings 6 adapt to technology changes in related markets such as lithography 7 adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain 8 qualify products for volume manufacturing with its customers and 9 successfully implement improvements in its manufacturing process the development introduction and support of an increasingly broad set of products including those enabling the transition to smaller device feature sizes and incorporation of new materials have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time furthermore new or improved products may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies compared to applied’s more established products and could adversely affect applied’s gross margins in addition applied must successfully implement changes in its design engineering methodology including changes that result in significant decreases in material costs and cycle time greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems and effective product life cycle management if applied does not successfully manage these challenges its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 

 

in fiscal 2005 approximately 80 percent of applied’s net sales were to regions outside the united states certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers of applied are also located outside the united states managing applied’s global operations presents challenges including but not limited to those arising from 1 varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands 2 global trade issues 3 variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights in different countries 4 rising raw material and energy costs 5 variations in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses 6 changes in laws and regulations of the united states including export restrictions and other countries as well as their interpretation and application 7 fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 8 the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations 9 political instability natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes or floods pandemics terrorism or acts of war where applied has operations suppliers or sales 10 cultural differences 11 special governmentsupported efforts to promote local integrated circuit manufacturing equipment companies and 12 shipping delays many of these challenges are present in china a large potential market for integrated circuit equipment and an area that applied anticipates will continue to present a significant opportunity for growth over the long term china is also experiencing significant growth of suppliers and potential competitors to applied these challenges as well as global uncertainties with respect to 1 economic growth rates in various countries 2 consumer confidence 3 the sustainability timing rate and amount of demand for electronics products and integrated circuits 4 capital spending by integrated circuit manufacturers 

and 5 price trends for certain integrated circuit devices may materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

 

applied’s customer base is and has been highly concentrated orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers of integrated circuits have accounted for and likely will continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s net sales in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or delay or cancel orders applied may not be able to replace the business as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment terms or other conditions that are less favorable to applied in addition certain customers have formed strategic alliances or collaborative efforts that result in additional complexities in managing individual customer relationships and transactions these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied’s success 

 

applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions changes in applied’s management or leadership the effectiveness of applied’s compensation programs including its equitybased programs and competitors’ hiring practices applied has made adjustments to its equity compensation programs such as implementation of a broadbased program providing for grants of restricted stock units referred to as “performance shares” in the applied materials inc employee stock incentive plan beginning in fiscal 2006 these changes as well as other changes in compensation practices or employee benefit programs may reduce the effectiveness of the equity compensation programs as incentives to employees andor may be disruptive to operations beginning in its first fiscal quarter of 2006 applied will record a charge to earnings for equitybased compensation such as stock options and restricted stock units performance shares in accordance with sfas 123r this requirement reduces the attractiveness of granting equitybased compensation as the expense associated with these grants will decrease applied’s profitability if applied does not successfully attract retain and motivate key employees as a result of these or other factors applied’s operating results and ability to capitalize on its opportunities may be materially and adversely affected 

 

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied’s ability to meet customer demand while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 

 

applied’s business depends on its ability to supply equipment services and related products that meet the rapidly changing requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers in developing regions including china additionally applied plans to transition to a singlevendor enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions including order management and manufacturing control significant interruptions of manufacturing operations or the delivery of services as a result of 1 the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts 2 volatility in the availability and cost of materials 3 difficulties or delays in obtaining required export approvals 4 information technology or infrastructure failures 5 difficulties in implementing the erp system 6 natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes or floods or 7 other causes such as regional economic downturns epidemics political instability terrorism or acts of war could result in delayed deliveries manufacturing inefficiencies increased costs or order cancellations moreover if actual demand for applied’s products is different than expected applied may purchase morefewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling postponing or expediting delivery of parts any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure to successfully implement outsourcing activities could adversely affect results of operations 

 

to better align costs with market conditions and to increase productivity and operational efficiency applied outsources certain functions to third parties including companies in india china and other countries these functions include engineering manufacturing customer support software development and administrative activities the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers in order to protect its intellectual property if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing strategy if required export approvals are not timely obtained or if third party providers do not perform as anticipated applied may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties increased costs manufacturing interruptions or delays andor loss of its intellectual property rights which could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions 

 

applied has made and may in the future make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary or aligned products services andor technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 1 diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters 2 inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all 3 inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition 4 failure to commercialize purchased technologies 5 ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal controls 6 impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired company or its product offerings 7 unknown underestimated andor undisclosed commitments or liabilities 8 failure to integrate and retain key employees and 9 ineffective integration of operations mergers and acquisitions are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights 

 

applied from time to time is and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights antitrust environmental regulations securities contracts product performance product liability unfair competition employment and other matters in addition applied on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and divert management’s attention and resources there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims applied previously entered into a mutual covenantnottosue arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future there can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with such a covenant in addition applied’s success depends in part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights infringement of applied’s rights by a third party such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change or if applied does not adequately assert these rights furthermore the laws of other countries including china permit the protection and enforcement of applied’s rights to varying extents which may not be sufficient to protect applied’s rights if applied is not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of the matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect future results 

 

as a global company applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities applied’s future tax rates 

could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates changes in the valuation of applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the tax laws for example us legislation governing taxation of extraterritorial income eti repealed certain export subsidies that were prohibited by the world trade organization and enacted different tax provisions these tax provisions will not fully offset the loss of the repealed tax provisions and as a result applied’s us tax liability may increase in addition applied is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals which could materially and adversely affect applied’s results of operations 

 

applied is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 applied’s management must perform evaluations of applied’s internal control over financial reporting beginning as of the end of fiscal 2005 and annually thereafter applied’s form 10k must include a report of its management’s assessment of the adequacy of such internal control and applied’s independent registered public accounting firm must publicly attest to the adequacy of management’s assessment and the effectiveness of applied’s internal control ongoing compliance with these requirements is complex costly and timeconsuming if applied fails to maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting if applied’s management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control or if applied’s independent registered public accounting firm does not timely attest to the evaluation applied could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the public’s perception of applied may decline 

 

applied is exposed to risks associated with expanded service product offerings and strategic transactions 

 

in order to improve customers’ manufacturing productivity and efficiency and as part of its growth strategy applied is expanding its service product offerings for both applied and nonapplied products these new service products which include onsite support as well as supply chain and spare parts management are offered in part through strategic relationships and alliances formed with or acquisitions of other suppliers to the semiconductor industry in order to develop this market opportunity applied must cultivate new business models form and maintain strategic relationships with appropriate companies achieve customer acceptance and successfully and costeffectively provide these service products applied’s inability to achieve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is subject to risks of noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations 

 

applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacture and use of its products the operation of its facilities and the use of its real property failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities the imposition of fines andor the suspension or termination of development manufacture or use of certain of its products or may affect the operation of its facilities or use of its real property each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment 

 

applied is subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates and with which applied must comply 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations if applied is found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws rules or regulations applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

at october 30 2005 applied’s investment portfolio included fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 56 billion applied’s primary objective for investing in fixedincome securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase based on applied’s investment portfolio at october 30 2005 and october 31 2004 an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 65 million and 49 million respectively while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixedincome securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired 

 

applied’s longterm debt bears interest at fixed rates as such applied’s interest expense would increase only to the extent that applied significantly increased the amount of variable rate obligations outstanding due to the shortterm nature and relatively low amount of applied’s variable rate obligations an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen british pound euro and israeli shekel applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied’s results of operations for fiscal 2003 2004 or 2005 

 

forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen british pound euro and israeli shekel and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions applied’s outstanding forward exchange contracts are markedtomarket see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged therefore the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions the effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied’s nearterm financial condition or results of operations applied’s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option premiums paid for options outstanding at october 30 2005 were not material

 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report management of applied conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of applied’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of applied’s disclosure controls 

and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e of the exchange act based upon that evaluation applied’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that applied’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report in ensuring that information required to be disclosed was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting applied’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of applied’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer management of applied conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of applied’s internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on that evaluation applied’s management concluded that applied’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of october 30 2005 

 

kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and as part of the audit has issued a report included herein on 1 applied’s management’s assessment of the effectiveness of applied’s internal control over financial reporting and 2 the effectiveness of applied’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting that materially affected applied’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 

 

inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  it should be noted that any system of controls however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met in addition the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

the stockholders and board of directors applied materials inc 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in item 9a controls and procedures that applied materials inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 30 2005 based on the criteria established in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso applied materials inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that applied materials inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 30 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by coso also in our opinion applied materials inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 30 2005 based on the criteria established in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by coso 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of applied materials inc as of october 30 2005 and october 31 2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended and our report dated december 14 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

applied’s net sales and net sales to samsung america inc represented 12 percent of applied’s net sales competition   the global semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and is characterized by increasingly rapid technological advancements and demanding worldwide service requirements applied’s ability to compete depends on its ability to commercialize its technology and continually improve its products processes and services as well as its ability to develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors for succeeding in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market include the equipment’s technical capability productivity and costeffectiveness and level of technical service and support provided by the vendor the importance of each of these factors varies depending on the specific customer’s needs and criteria including considerations such as the customer’s process application product requirements timing of the purchase and particular circumstances of the purchasing decision the pace of technological change is rapid with customers continually moving to smaller critical dimensions and larger wafer sizes and adopting new materials for fabricating the chip existing technology can be adapted to the new requirements however these requirements sometimes create the need for an entirely different technical approach the rapid pace of technological change continually creates opportunities for existing competitors and startups and can quickly diminish the value of existing technologies   substantial competition exists for each of applied’s products competitors range from small companies that compete with a single product andor in a single region to global companies with multiple lines of semiconductor processing products competitors in a given technology tend to have different degrees of market presence in the various regional markets management believes that applied is a strong competitor and that its competitive position is based on the ability of its products and services to continue to address customer requirements success for applied will require a continued high level of investment in rde and in sales marketing and customer support activities patents and licenses   management believes that applied’s competitive position is significantly dependent upon skills in engineering manufacturing and marketing and not just on its patent position however protection of applied’s technological assets by obtaining and enforcing patents is important therefore applied has a practice to file patent applications in the us and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a number of patents in the us and other countries and additional applications are pending for new developments in its equipment and processes applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent although taken as a whole the rights of applied and the products made and sold under its patents are a significant element of applied’s business in addition to patents applied also possesses other proprietary intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights   applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in its best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied for the life of the patents applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from and paid to third parties have not been and are not expected to be material 8   in the normal course of business applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in dealing with such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms if applied is not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of the matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applied’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected environmental matters   two of applied’s locations have been designated as environmental cleanup sites in 1987 the united states environmental protection agency designated one of the locations in santa clara california as a superfund site and named applied as a “responsible party” cleanup activities at this site began in 1984 and were substantially completed in february 2002 the california regional water quality control board has designated applied as a “discharger” with respect to the other site in sunnyvale california applied was named a discharger at the sunnyvale site in 1997 as it currently owns the site in question however prior owners and operators are responsible for performing cleanup and monitoring activities applied maintains a number of environmental health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature neither compliance with federal state and local provisions regulating discharge of materials into the environment nor remedial agreements or other actions relating to the environment has had or is expected to have a material effect on applied’s capital expenditures competitive position financial

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend results of operations   applied develops manufactures markets and services integrated circuit fabrication equipment for the worldwide semiconductor industry demand for applied’s products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to changes in 1 global economic conditions 2 advanced technology andor capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers 3 the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers 4 supply and demand for semiconductors and 5 relative competitiveness of applied’s products and services for this and other reasons applied’s results of operations for fiscal 2001 2002 and 2003 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results   effective the first fiscal quarter of 2001 applied implemented the sec’s staff accounting bulletin no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” for periods prior to fiscal 2001 data was not available to provide pro forma information as if the change in accounting principle were applied retroactively for further details see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

   applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2001 2002 and 2003 as a result of these conditions there were significant fluctuations in applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales both 15 within and across fiscal years demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors including rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 

  quarterly and full fiscal year financial information follows   16   net sales by geographic region which were attributed to the location of the customers’ facilities were as follows      during the first fiscal quarter of 2001 slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment inventory buildups in telecommunication products slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused semiconductor companies to reduce their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders this decline in demand deepened sequentially throughout fiscal 2001 into a severe industry downturn due to continued weakness in the macroeconomic climate and consumption of electronic goods which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by applied’s customers included in fiscal 2001 net sales were 642 million of revenue recognized as part of the cumulative effect of implementing the sec’s staff accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements”   net sales declined 31 percent from 73 billion for fiscal 2001 to 51 billion for fiscal 2002 the decline in demand for applied’s products continued into the first fiscal quarter of 2002 in the second fiscal quarter of 2002 customers ordered equipment for 200mm advanced capacity to satisfy demand driven by consumerrelated and wireless devices customers ordered 200mm capacity for this demand increase as their transition to 300mm equipment was not yet complete customers also continued to place technology orders to invest in 300mm wafer processing copper and smaller linewidth technologies however second quarter demand levels proved to be unsustainable as the global economic environment weakened through the middle of the year and customers reduced their level of capacity spending accordingly while maintaining advanced technology spending net sales peaked in the third fiscal quarter of 2002 and flattened in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002 included in fiscal 2002 net sales was the remaining 9 million of revenue that was recognized as part of the cumulative effect of implementing sab 101   net sales declined 12 percent from 51 billion for fiscal 2002 to 45 billion for fiscal 2003 orders declined from 16 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002 to 10 billion for the first and second fiscal quarters of 2003 reflecting the continued and prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry however orders increased to 11 billion for the third fiscal quarter and 13 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 reflecting customers’ continued investments in memory and logic and their transition to 300mm along with the increased capacity utilization in both advanced and established technologies following the new order trends net sales decreased to approximately 11 billion for each of the first three fiscal quarters of 2003 reflecting the impact of the prolonged industry downturns and increased to 12 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 indicating the beginning of an industry recovery 

 

   in response to the continuing difficult business conditions applied implemented a series of activities to better align applied’s cost structure with prevailing economic conditions during early fiscal 2003 realignment activities consisted of consolidation of facilities reductions in workforce and refocused product efforts such as the electronbeam mask pattern product line and implementation of the global spare parts distribution system which included a closure of a central warehouse as a result of the realignment activities applied vacated approximately two million square feet and reduced approximately 3800 positions realignment activities resulted in charges across multiple categories as incurred including cost of products sold research development and engineering expenses and restructuring and asset impairment charges as discussed below 17 

 

   gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from 443 percent for fiscal 2001 to 406 percent for fiscal 2002 and to 358 percent for fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2000 applied experienced unprecedented new order and revenue growth accordingly applied expanded its manufacturing facilities to accommodate anticipated growth the decreased business volume in fiscal 2001 2002 and 2003 due to the industry downturn was insufficient to fully absorb the overhead costs of these facilities resulting in lower gross margins for all respective periods the continued decline in gross margin for fiscal 2003 was principally attributable to under absorption of manufacturing and field service costs as a result of prolonged lower business volumes and inventory writeoffs and charges associated with refocused product efforts including an electronbeam mask pattern product and implementation of the global spare parts distribution system 

 

   applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in research development and engineering rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced semiconductor designs applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing in rde in order to continue to offer new products and technologies as a result rde expenses were 12 billion 16 percent of net sales for fiscal 2001 11 billion 21 percent of net sales for fiscal 2002 and 921 million 21 percent of net sales for fiscal 2003 development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product most of applied’s existing product lines are the result of internal product development activities in certain instances applied acquires technologies either in existing areas of development or through new product opportunities to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market for market entry and penetration throughout the periods covered by this report applied has developed products designed to enable our customers to fabricate chips with 65nm and below feature sizes and new materials such as copper and low k dielectrics   during fiscal 2001 applied continued its development of technologies for copper and low kbased chips and 300mm wafers as well as focused efforts on the core technologies that would be required for customers to begin development of 100nm and below generation devices areas of increased investment included maskmaking technology metrology and inspection ion implantation and products for depositing and etching new materials   in fiscal 2002 applied invested in critical development activities to meet its customers’ rapid move to sub100nm dimensions in their most advanced designs which were anticipated to begin entering production in fiscal 2003 this difficult and challenging dimensional shift was compounded by the need to provide much of the technology for both 200mm and 300mm wafers requiring additional process and hardware development for the sub100nm chip generations inspection and metrology tools became more important to assure enhanced device performance as well as adequate manufacturing yields accordingly applied focused its rde resources on these technologies in addition development of innovations such as advanced wafer wet cleaning and atomic layer deposition which deposits materials in increasingly smaller structures addressed new market opportunities for applied within virtually all of the technology areas including fab and yield management applied invested in more advanced software capabilities   in fiscal 2003 applied refocused product efforts and made investments in strategic products applied focused on the development of several important processing technologies to enable the production of new chips using copper and low k dielectric materials as well as to meet the challenges of smaller 65nm and below feature sizes in addition to interconnect solutions applied continued to invest resources in the development of systems for advanced transistor designs with smaller gate structures that enable faster signal propagation and reduced power applied also continued the development of its process diagnostic and control capabilities with systems to inspect and measure smaller dimensions and defects 

 

   marketing selling general and administrative expenses decreased from 902 million 12 percent of net sales for fiscal 2001 to 709 million 14 percent of net sales for fiscal 2002 and to 626 million 14 percent of net sales for fiscal 2003 the decreases from fiscal 2001 to 2002 and 2003 were due primarily to headcount reductions and cost reduction activities limiting discretionary expenditures to align costs to a lower business volume  18 

 

   the restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2001 2002 and 2003 were intended to better align applied’s cost structure with prevailing market conditions due to the prolonged industry downturn these actions which were necessary as a result of reduced business volume reduced applied’s global workforce and consolidated global facilities   restructuring asset impairments and other charges for fiscal 2001 totaled 221 million consisting of a charge of 10 million for acquired inprocess research and development and restructuring and asset impairment charges of 211 million the restructuring and asset impairment charges of 211 million consisted of 105 million for headcount reductions 45 million for consolidation of facilities and 61 million for other costs primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidation as of october 26 2003 the majority of the fiscal 2001 restructuring actions have been completed   restructuring asset impairments and other charges for fiscal 2002 totaled 85 million consisting of a charge of 8 million for acquired inprocess research and development and restructuring and asset impairment charges of 77 million the restructuring and asset impairment charges consisted of 39 million for headcount reductions 16 million for consolidation of facilities and 22 million for other costs primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidation as of october 26 2003 the majority of the fiscal 2002 restructuring actions have been completed   restructuring asset impairments and other charges for fiscal 2003 totaled 372 million consisting of 186 million for headcount reductions 86 million for consolidation of facilities and 100 million for other costs primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidation the fiscal 2003 restructuring activities are expected to be completed during early 2004 which will result in additional costs   for further details see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

   net interest income was 174 million for fiscal 2001 131 million for fiscal 2002 and 102 million for fiscal 2003 the decrease in net interest income in fiscal 2002 and 2003 was due primarily to lower average interest rates 

 

   applied’s effective income tax provisionbenefit rate was 298 percent for fiscal 2001 210 percent for fiscal 2002 and 295 percent for fiscal 2003 the actual effective rate for fiscal 2001 of 298 percent differed from the anticipated effective rate of 295 percent due to the nontax deductible nature of 10 million of acquired inprocess research and development expense and a shift in the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income applied’s actual effective rate of 210 percent for fiscal 2002 differed from the anticipated effective rate of 295 percent primarily due to significant foreign sales corporation and extraterritorial income tax benefits which resulted from an increase in foreign sales corporation and extraterritorial qualified income without these additional benefits earnings per share would have been reduced by 002 for fiscal 2002  applied expected and experienced an actual effective benefit rate of 295 percent for fiscal 2003 applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of applied’s pretax income and nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions

recent accounting pronouncement   in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” fin 46 provides guidance on 1 the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights known as “variable interest entities” vies and 2 which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary and when it should consolidate a vie this new requirement for consolidation applies to entities 1 where the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or 2 whose equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties in addition fin 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures fin 46 is effective for all new vies created or acquired after january 31 2003 for vies created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after december 15 2003 certain disclosures are effective immediately applied holds an interest in a venture fund applied materials ventures i lp ventures i applied will implement fin 46 during the first fiscal quarter of 2004 and will consolidate ventures i as a vie applied does not expect the implementation to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations for additional discussion of this recent accounting pronouncement and ventures i see note 1 and note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements financial condition liquidity and capital resources   applied increased its cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments from 49 billion at october 27 2002 to 55 billion at october 26 2003 applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years   applied generated cash from operating activities of 16 billion for fiscal 2001 492 million for fiscal 2002 and 802 million for fiscal 2003 the primary sources of cash from operating activities have been net income as adjusted to exclude the effect of noncash charges and changes in working capital levels including accounts receivable and inventories applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of 12 billion for fiscal 2001 689 million for fiscal 2002 and 556 million for fiscal 2003 these accounts receivable sales had the effect of increasing cash and reducing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding days sales outstanding was 68 days at the end of fiscal 2003 compared to 66 days at the end of fiscal 2002 and 56 days at the end of fiscal 2001 a portion of these sold accounts receivable is subject to certain limited recourse provisions however applied has not experienced any losses under these programs for further details regarding accounts receivable sales see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements  inventories were reduced by 323 million in fiscal 2003 due to ongoing inventory reduction and management programs   applied used 16 billion of cash for investing activities for fiscal 2001 693 million for fiscal 2002 and 731 million for fiscal 2003 capital expenditures net of retirements were 711 million for fiscal 2001 417 million for fiscal 2002 and 212 million for fiscal 2003 totaling 13 billion for the past three years application laboratories equipment and related facilities comprised most of the capital spending the largest capital expenditure for the last three years was 153 million for additional construction and fitup of the maydan process module technology center in sunnyvale california where applied’s demonstration laboratories for new technology applications are located fiscal 2002 capital expenditures also included 65 million for the purchase of properties in santa clara california that were previously held under a synthetic lease fiscal 2003 capital expenditures also included 52 million for the purchase of facilities in hillsboro oregon that were previously held under a synthetic lease investing activities also included purchases and sales of shortterm investments and acquisitions of technology or of other companies to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies   applied used 261 million of cash from financing activities for fiscal 2001 and generated 131 million for fiscal 2002 and 8 million for fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2001 net common stock activity used 169 million of cash as stock repurchases increased and stock sales to employees decreased during fiscal 2002 and 2003 net common stock activity generated 75 million and 73 million of cash as proceeds received from stock sales to employees exceeded the amount used for stock repurchases since march 1996 applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to partially fund its stockbased employee benefit and incentive plans financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt net changes in debt used 92 million of cash for fiscal 2001 generated 56 million of cash for fiscal 2002 and used 64 million of cash for fiscal 2003 20   on march 21 2002 applied’s board of directors approved a twoforone stock split of applied’s common stock which was distributed in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend on or about april 16 2002 to stockholders of record as of april 1 2002   although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding applied’s operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended october 26 2003 see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this annual report on form 10k offbalance sheet arrangements   during the ordinary course of business applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries as of october 26 2003 the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately 56 million applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed applied does not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements   applied also has additional guarantee arrangements on behalf of certain subsidiaries as of october 26 2003 applied has not recorded any liability related to guarantees of subsidiary obligations applied does not expect based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements subsidiary guarantees as of october 26 2003 were associated with the following types of arrangements shortterm borrowings term loans overdrafts and leases while certain subsidiaries have shortterm borrowing term loans and overdraft facilities available totaling approximately 169 million as of october 26 2003 no amounts were outstanding as october 26 2003 in the event of use and subsequent default of these facilities by applied’s subsidiaries such arrangements would be guaranteed by applied in addition certain subsidiaries have lease arrangements guaranteed by applied these leases will expire between 2009 and 2014 in the event that the subsidiaries do not make the required payments applied could be required to pay the leases on behalf of the subsidiaries as of october 26 2003 annual lease obligations under these arrangements approximated 12 million   ventures i invests in privatelyheld earlystage companies engaged in developing systems components and devices based on nanotechnology for specific applications and products ventures i is a limited partnership with applied as the sole limited partner and an independent party as the general partner applied has committed to fund 50 million in capital contributions but has reserved the option to discontinue capital contributions at 25 million applied’s capital contributions to ventures i totaled approximately 9 million through october 27 2002 and 16 million through october 26 2003 see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on ventures i   applied also has operating leases for various facilities total rental expense for operating leases was 153 million for fiscal 2001 140 million for fiscal 2002 and 134 million for fiscal 2003   the following table summarizes the effect on applied’s liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations of debt arrangements and noncancelable operating leases as of october 26 2003  critical accounting policies   the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies as defined below 21   a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied’s financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied’s financial condition and results of operations specifically critical accounting estimates have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applied’s financial condition or results of operations   estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applied’s operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled “trends risks and uncertainties” based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of applied’s financial condition and results of operations   management believes that the following are critical accounting policies 

 

   applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied’s estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also reviews goodwill annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 sfas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgment regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 22 

 

   applied accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 sfas 109 “accounting for income taxes” which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets   applied provides for income taxes based upon an annual estimated effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims either asserted or unasserted that arise in the ordinary course of business applied evaluates among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated when applied determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred the effect is recorded promptly in the consolidated financial statements although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty applied does not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations however significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations trends risks and uncertainties 

 

   as a supplier to the global semiconductor industry applied is subject to the industry’s business cycles the timing length and volatility of which are difficult to predict the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and manufacturing capacity including capacity utilizing the latest technology the rate of changes in demand including end demand is accelerating and the effect of these changes on applied is occurring sooner exacerbating the volatility of these cycles these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology and continue to affect applied’s net sales gross margin and results of operations in addition to affecting applied’s customers and suppliers these business cycles also challenge key management engineering and other employees of applied   during periods of increasing demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and must be able to attract hire assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals the semiconductor industry appears to be in the early stages of an upturn however management cannot predict the sustainability of a recovery if any andor the industry’s rate of growth in such a recovery both of which will be affected by many factors including the global uncertainties discussed below if applied is unable to effectively manage its resources and production capacity during an industry upturn there could be a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations conversely in downturns applied must be able to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions and effectively motivate and retain key employees in response to the downturn that began in fiscal 2001 applied continues the implementation of realignment activities in order to align its cost structure with business conditions and to enable applied to focus resources on core research and development programs if applied is unable to implement these realignment activities according to the timetable and to the extent anticipated if implementation negatively affects applied’s operations net sales or profitability or if applied does not maintain effective cost controls applied’s business financial condition or results of operations may be negatively affected 23 

 

 technological changes 

  because it operates in a highly competitive environment applied’s future success is heavily dependent upon effective development commercialization and customer acceptance of its new products and services over those of its competitors specifically these risks may include but are not limited to applied’s ability to timely and costeffectively 1 develop new products services and technologies including those utilizing new materials such as copper and lowk materials 2 improve existing products services and technologies 3 develop new markets in the semiconductor industry for applied’s products and services 4 introduce new products and services to the marketplace 5 achieve market acceptance and accurately forecast demand for its products and services 6 transition from 200mm systems to 300mm systems 7 qualify new or improved products for volume manufacturing with its customers 8 commence and adjust production to meet customer demands 9 price products and services appropriately and 10 lower customers’ cost of ownership the development introduction and support of an increasingly broad set of new or improved products services and technologies including those enabling the transition to smaller device feature sizes new materials and 300mm wafers grow increasingly complex and expensive over time such new or improved products and services may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies compared to applied’s more established products and services and could adversely affect applied’s gross margins if applied does not develop and introduce new or improved products services and technologies in a timely and costeffective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements its competitive position financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

   the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid ongoing changes including 1 more complex technology requirements 2 the changing information technology cost structure and the importance of driving down cost of ownership 3 the increasing significance of consumer electronics as a driver for chip demand and the related focus on lower prices 4 the growing type and variety of integrated circuits and applications 5 an increasing number of applications across multiple substrate sizes in the semiconductor industry resulting in divergent interests among semiconductor manufacturers 6 a rising percentage of business from customers in asia and emergence of customers and competitors in new geographical regions 7 customer demands for increasingly shorter lead times for the manufacture and installation of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and 8 higher capital requirements for new semiconductor fabrication plants these factors are increasing the need for customer partnering use of foundries collective research and development efforts and process integration support these trends also heighten the importance of spare parts and services as a competitive advantage for semiconductor equipment manufacturers in addition key integrated circuit manufacturers have become influential in technology decisions made by their global partners if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry its business financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected 

 

   applied’s customer base is and has been highly concentrated orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers of integrated circuits have accounted for and likely will continue to account for a substantial portion of applied’s net sales which may lead customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to applied in addition sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter if current customers delay cancel or do not place orders applied may not be able to replace these orders with new orders as applied’s products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant and often nonrecoverable costs the resulting fluctuations in the amount of and terms of orders could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   during fiscal 2003 more than 70 percent of applied’s net sales were to regions outside the united states certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers of applied are also located outside the united states managing applied’s global operations presents challenges including those arising from periodic regional economic downturns trade balance issues varying business conditions and demands variations in enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in different jurisdictions differences in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses changes in us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates the need to provide 24 sufficient levels of technical support in different locations cultural differences and shipping delays among other risks many of these challenges are present in china a large potential market for semiconductor equipment and an area that applied anticipates will present a significant opportunity for growth these challenges as well as global uncertainties with respect to 1 economic growth rates in various countries 2 sustainability of demand for electronics products 3 capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 4 price weakness for certain semiconductor devices and 5 political instability terrorism acts of war or epidemics in regions where applied has operations or sales including asia and israel may affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   applied’s success depends in large part on its ability to attract retain and motivate key employees including those in managerial technical marketing and support roles achieving this objective may be difficult due to changes in the global economy the industry applied’s workforce actions and realignment activities and its changes in management if applied does not successfully attract retain and motivate key employees the company’s operating results and ability to capitalize on its opportunities may be materially and adversely affected 

 

   applied’s business depends on its ability to supply products that meet the rapidly changing demands of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies parts from suppliers some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers in addition applied outsources certain manufacturing activities significant interruptions of manufacturing operations as a result of the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts outsourcing difficulties natural disasters such as earthquakes or tornadoes or other causes such as information technology or infrastructure failures regional economic downturns political instability terrorism acts of war or epidemics could result in delayed product deliveries or manufacturing inefficiencies any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   applied has made and may in the future make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 1 diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters 2 the inability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition 3 failure to commercialize purchased technology 4 impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired company 5 integration and retention of key employees and 6 integration of operations mergers and acquisitions are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacture and use of its products failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities the imposition of fines andor the suspension or termination of development manufacture or use of certain of its products each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   applied is subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the regions in which applied operates and with which applied must comply and 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade   for example the world trade organization wto has determined that the us foreign sales corporation fsc and extraterritorial income eti exclusion constitute prohibited export subsidies warranting the possible imposition of trade sanctions on certain goods applied has benefited from fsc and eti tax provisions and the elimination of these tax benefits could materially and adversely affect applied’s financial condition and results of operations 25   during fiscal 2002 applied filed an application with the sec for an exemptive order confirming that it is not subject to the investment company act of 1940 the act which requires companies primarily engaged in the business of investing in securities to comply with additional rules and regulations largely due to the industry downturn applied’s ratios of investments to total assets and of interest income to net income have increased resulting in the risk that applied could be deemed to be covered by the act if the sec does not grant the exemption applied may have to take other actions that could adversely affect its results of operations in order not to be subject to the act

the global semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and is characterized by increasingly rapid technological advancements and demanding worldwide service requirements applieds ability to compete depends on its ability to commercialize its technology and continually improve its products processes and services as well as its ability to develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors for succeeding in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market include the equipments technical capability productivity and costeffectiveness overall reliability ease of use and maintenance contamination and defect control and the level of technical service and support provided by the vendor the importance of each of these factors varies depending on the specific customers needs and criteria including considerations such as the customers process application product requirements timing of the purchase and particular circumstances of the purchasing decision the pace of technological change is rapid with customers continually moving to smaller critical dimensions and larger wafer sizes and adopting new materials for use in semiconductor manufacturing sometimes existing technology can be adapted to the new requirements however these requirements sometimes create the need for an entirely new technical approach the rapid pace of technological change continually creates opportunities for existing competitors and startups and can quickly diminish the value of existing technologies substantial competition exists for each of applieds products competitors range from small companies that compete with a single innovative product to companies with a large and diverse line of semiconductor processing products competitors in a given technology tend to have different degrees of market presence in the various regional markets management believes that applied is a strong competitor and that its competitive position is based on the ability of its products and services to continue to address customer requirements success for applied will require a continued high level of investment in rde and in sales marketing and customer support activities patents and licenses 

management believes that applieds competitive position is significantly dependent upon skills in engineering manufacturing and marketing and not just on its patent position however protection of applieds technology assets by obtaining and enforcing patents is important therefore applied has a program to file patent applications in the us and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a number of patents in the us and other countries and additional applications are pending for new developments in its equipment and processes applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent although taken as a whole the rights of applied and the products made and sold under patents are a significant element of applieds business in addition to patents applied also possesses other proprietary intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in its best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied for the life of the patents applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from third parties are not expected to be material in the normal course of business applied from time to time receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in dealing with such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms if applied is not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of the matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applieds business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected environmental matters 

two of applieds locations have been designated as environmental cleanup sites in 1987 the united states environmental protection agency designated one of the locations in santa clara california as a superfund site and named applied as a responsible party cleanup activities have been underway since 1984 the california regional water quality control board has designated applied as a discharger with respect to the other site in sunnyvale california applied was named a discharger at the sunnyvale site because it currently owns the site in question although prior owners and operators are being required to perform cleanup and monitoring activities neither compliance with federal state and local provisions regulating discharge of materials into the environment nor remedial agreements or other actions relating to the environment has had or is expected to have a material effect on applieds capital expenditures competitive position financial condition or results of operations employees 

none of applieds employees are represented by a trade union and management considers its relations with employees to be good in the hightechnology industry competition for highlyskilled employees is intense applied believes that its future success is highly dependent upon on its continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees there can be no assurance that applied will be able to attract hire assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified people at october 27 2002 applied employed 16077 regular employees on november 4 2002 applied announced a headcount reduction of approximately 1750 positions or 11 percent of its global workforce in response to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry available information

results of operations 

applied develops manufactures markets and services semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment for the worldwide semiconductor industry demand for applieds products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to changes in 1 global economic conditions 2 supply and demand for semiconductors 3 the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers 4 advanced technology andor capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers and 5 relative competitiveness of applieds products and services for this and other reasons applieds results of operations for fiscal 2000 2001 and 2002 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results effective the first fiscal quarter of 2001 applied implemented the securities and exchange

  9564 7343 5062        primarily the united states    includes china in fiscal 2000 the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries were in a period of expansion and applied achieved record levels of new orders net sales and net income for this period however during the first fiscal quarter of 2001 slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for manufacturing equipment inventory buildups in telecommunication products slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused semiconductor companies to reevaluate their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders this decline in demand deepened sequentially throughout fiscal 2001 and the first fiscal quarter of 2002 into a severe industry downturn due to continued weakness in the macroeconomic climate and consumption of electronic goods which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by applieds customers as a result of these factors net sales declined 23 percent from 96 billion for fiscal 2000 to 73 billion for fiscal 2001 also included in fiscal 2001 net sales was 642 million of revenue that was recognized as part of the cumulative effect of implementing the securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements net sales declined 31 percent from 73 billion for fiscal 2001 to 51 billion for fiscal 2002 the decline in demand for applieds products continued into the first fiscal quarter of 2002 in the second fiscal quarter of 2002 customers began to order equipment for 200mm advanced capacity to satisfy demand driven by consumerrelated and wireless devices customers ordered 200mm capacity for this increase in demand as their transition to 300mm equipment was not yet complete customers also continued to place technology orders to invest in 300mm wafer processing copper and smaller linewidth technologies however second quarter demand levels proved to be unsustainable as the global economic environment weakened through the middle of the year and customers reduced their level of capacity spending accordingly while maintaining advanced technology spending net sales peaked in the third fiscal quarter of 2002 and flattened in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002 included in fiscal 2002 net sales was the remaining 9 million of revenue that was recognized as part of the cumulative effect of implementing sab 101 gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from 508 percent for fiscal 2000 to 443 percent for fiscal 2001 and to 406 percent for fiscal 2002 during fiscal 1999 and 2000 applied experienced unprecedented new order and revenue growth accordingly applied expanded its manufacturing facilities during these periods to accommodate current and anticipated growth the decreased business volume for fiscal 2001 and 2002 due to the industry downturn was insufficient to fully absorb the overhead costs of these facilities resulting in lower gross margins for fiscal 2001 and 2002 the decrease in fiscal 2002 gross margin was also attributable to customer service and support activities primarily startup costs associated with a new spare parts distribution system and excess overhead resulting from the decline in system installations research development and engineering applieds future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced chip designs applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing in rde especially during industry downturns in order to continue to offer new products and technologies as a result rde expenses remained relatively flat at 11 billion 116 percent of net sales for fiscal 2000 12 billion 163 percent of net sales for fiscal 2001 and 11 billion 208 percent of net sales for fiscal 2002 product development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the tool development is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product area most of applieds existing product lines are the result of internal product development activities in certain instances applied acquires technologies in either existing areas of development or new product opportunities to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market for market entry and penetration throughout the periods covered by this report applied has been investing in its new process module products to provide customers with a qualified integrated and optimized production process flow for building microstructures on advanced chips process modules are designed to link certain applied equipment to deliver an integrated process application to the customer for wafer processing during fiscal 2001 applied continued its development of technologies for copper and low k based chips and 300mm wafers as well as focused efforts on the core technologies that will be required for chipmakers to begin development of 100nm generation devices areas of increased investment included maskmaking technology metrology and inspection ion implantation and products for depositing and etching new materials in fiscal 2002 applied invested in critical development activities to meet customers rapid move to sub100nm dimensions in their most advanced designs which are expected to begin entering production in fiscal 2003 this difficult and challenging dimensional shift is matched by the need to provide much of the technology for both 200mm and 300mm wafers requiring additional process and hardware development for the sub100nm chip generations inspection and metrology tools have become more important to assure enhanced device performance as well as adequate manufacturing yields accordingly applied focused its rde resources on these technologies in addition development of new technologies such as advanced wafer wet cleaning and atomic

2002 were due primarily to cost reduction activities limiting discretionary expenditures and to lower business volume nonrecurring items nonrecurring items for fiscal 2000 totaled 40 million or 002 per diluted share after tax related to merger expenses for the acquisition of etec nonrecurring items for fiscal 2001 totaled 221 million or 009 per diluted share after tax consisting of a pretax charge of 10 million for acquired inprocess research and development and pretax restructuring charges of 211 million during fiscal 2001 applied recorded pretax restructuring charges of 211 million consisting of 105 million for headcount reductions 45 million for consolidation of facilities and 61 million for other costs primarily fixed asset writeoffs these restructuring actions occurred in applieds second third and fourth fiscal quarters and were taken to better align applieds cost structure with prevailing market conditions during the second fiscal quarter of 2001 applied completed a voluntary separation plan that resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 1000 employees or three percent of its global workforce for a cost of 47 million during the third fiscal quarter of 2001 applied recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 4 million associated with severance and benefit costs during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001 applied eliminated approximately 2000 additional positions or 10 percent of its global workforce for a cost of 54 million the majority of the affected employees were based in santa clara california and austin texas and represented multiple company activities and functions nonrecurring items for fiscal 2002 totaled 85 million or 004 per diluted share after tax consisting of a pretax charge of 8 million for acquired inprocess research and development and a pretax restructuring charge of 77 million the pretax restructuring charge which was recorded in the first fiscal quarter of 2002 consisted of 39 million for headcount reductions 16 million for consolidation of facilities and 22 million for other costs primarily fixed asset writeoffs this restructuring action was taken to better align applieds cost structure with prevailing market conditions due to the prolonged industry downturn and it reduced applieds global workforce by approximately 1100 employees or six percent the majority of the affected employees were based in santa clara california and austin texas and represented multiple company activities and functions for further details see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements nonrecurring income nonrecurring income of 68 million for fiscal 2000 was related to a 1998 litigation settlement with asm international nv for further details see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements net interest income net interest income was 133 million for fiscal 2000 174 million for fiscal 2001 and 131 million for fiscal 2002 the increase for fiscal 2001 was due primarily to higher average cash and investment balances the decrease for fiscal 2002 was due primarily to lower average interest rates provision for income taxes applieds effective income tax rate was 300 percent for fiscal 2000 298 percent for fiscal 2001 and 210 percent for fiscal 2002 applied expected an effective rate of 295 percent for fiscal 2001 which decreased from the fiscal 2000 effective rate due to a shift in the geographic composition of applieds pretax income the actual effective rate for fiscal 2001 of 298 percent differed from the expected rate of 295 percent due to the nontax deductible nature of 10 million of acquired inprocess research and development expense applieds actual effective rate of 210 percent for fiscal 2002 differed from the anticipated effective rate of 295 percent primarily due to significant foreign sales corporation and extraterritorial income tax benefits absent these additional benefits earnings per diluted share would have been reduced by 002 for fiscal 2002 applieds future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of applieds pretax income nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies business combinations on november 20 2001 applied acquired the assets of schlumbergers electronbeam wafer inspection business for 66

applied increased its cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments from 48 billion at october 28 2001 to 49 billion at october 27 2002 applied has generated 37 billion of cash from operating activities during the past three years primarily from net income and working capital management applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years applied generated cash from operating activities of 17 billion for fiscal 2000 16 billion for fiscal 2001 and 492 million for fiscal 2002 the primary sources of cash from operating activities have been net income as adjusted to exclude the effect of noncash charges and changes in working capital requirements including accounts receivable and inventories applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of 15 billion for fiscal 2000 12 billion for fiscal 2001 and 689 million for fiscal 2002 these receivable sales had the effect of increasing cash and reducing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding days sales outstanding was 66 days at the end of fiscal 2002 compared to 56 days at the end of fiscal 2001 and 73 days at the end of fiscal 2000 applied has not experienced any losses under these programs and receivables sold under these programs have terms and credit risk characteristics similar to applieds overall receivables portfolio for further details regarding accounts receivable sales see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements inventories were reduced by 139 million in fiscal 2002 due to lower systems inventories partially offset by an increase in customer service spares inventories to support new 300mm products shipped to customers applied used 10 billion of cash for investing activities for fiscal 2000 16 billion for fiscal 2001 and 693 million for fiscal 2002 capital expenditures net of retirements were 383 million for fiscal 2000 711 million for fiscal 2001 and 417 million for fiscal year 2002 totaling 15 billion for the past three years application laboratories equipment and related facilities comprised most of the capital spending the largest capital expenditure for the last three years was the construction and fitup of the maydan process module technology center where applieds demonstration laboratories for new technology applications are located fiscal 2002 capital expenditures also included 65 million for the purchase of properties in santa clara california that were previously held under a synthetic lease investing activities also included purchases and sales of shortterm investments and acquisitions of technology or of other companies to allow applied to access new market segments or emerging technology applied generated 149 million of cash from financing activities for fiscal 2000 used 261 million for fiscal 2001 and generated 131 million for fiscal 2002 net common stock activities issuances of common stock under employee stock plans offset by share repurchases generated 99 million for fiscal 2000 as a result of a significant increase in option exercises by employees reflecting applieds higher average stock price partially offset by stock repurchases during fiscal 2001 net common stock activity used 169 million of cash as stock repurchases increased and stock sales to employees decreased reflecting applieds lower average stock price in fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2002 net common stock activity generated 75 million of cash due to stock sales to employees and lower stock repurchases since march 1996 applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open

fiscal 2000 used 92 million of cash for fiscal 2001 and generated 56 million of cash for fiscal 2002 to date applied has not declared or paid cash dividends to its stockholders due to a number of factors including the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential requirements to finance working capital in the event of a significant upturn in business applied reevaluates this practice from time to time but is not contemplating the payment of a cash dividend on march 21 2002 applieds board of directors approved a twoforone stock split of applieds common stock which was distributed in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend on or about april 16 2002 to stockholders of record as of april 1 2002 although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors applieds management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies as defined below a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applieds financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applieds financial condition and results of operations specifically critical accounting estimates have the following attributes 1 applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and 2 different estimates applied could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on applieds financial condition or results of operations estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as applieds operating environment changes these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known in addition management is periodically faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled trends risks and uncertainties based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that applieds consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and present a meaningful presentation of applieds financial condition and results of operations management believes that the following are critical accounting policies warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and configuration experience statistics and regional warranty support costs applieds warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period as applieds customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applieds estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on applieds business financial condition and results of operations inventories inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin firstout basis the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand in addition known and anticipated engineering change orders are evaluated for potential obsolescence if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on applieds business financial condition and results of operations goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also reviews goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition the value assigned to intangible assets is determined by an independent valuation firm based on estimates and judgment regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value in addition sfas no 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually using a twostep process the first step is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value if a potential impairment is identified the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on applieds business financial condition and results of operations income taxes applied accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas no 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets applied provides for income taxes based upon an annual estimated effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of applieds tax planning strategies management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate which could have a material effect on applieds financial condition and results of operations trends risks and uncertainties 

the industry that applied serves is highly volatile and unpredictable as a supplier to the semiconductor industry applied is subject to the business cycles that characterize the industrythe timing length and volatility of these cycles are difficult to predict the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and capacity requirements including capacity utilizing the latest technology the rate of changes in demand including end demand is accelerating and the effect of these changes upon applied is occurring sooner exacerbating the volatility of these cycles these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology these industry cycles create pressure on applieds net sales gross margin and net income in addition to affecting applieds customers and suppliers these cycles challenge key management engineering and other employees of applied who are vital to applieds success during periods of declining demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment customers typically reduce purchases delay delivery of products andor cancel orders during downturns applied must be able to timely and effectively align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions to manage its inventory levels to reduce the possibility of future inventory writedowns resulting from obsolescence and liability to suppliers for order cancellations and to motivate and retain key employees during periods of rapid growth applied must be able to acquire andor develop sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and to attract hire assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified people if applied is unable to achieve its objectives in a timely manner during changes in business conditions there could be a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations the semiconductor equipment industry is currently experiencing a continued and prolonged downturn management believes that this current downturn may be the most severe decline in history and cannot predict when a recovery will begin or what the industrys rate of growth will be in such a recovery applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business currently 74 percent of applieds revenues result from sales outside the us with an increasing percentage of sales to customers headquartered in asia certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers are also located outside the us managing applieds global operations presents challenges including periodic regional economic downturns trade balance issues varying business conditions and demands political instability variations in enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in different jurisdictions differences in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses changes in us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates the ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations cultural differences shipping delays and terrorist acts or acts of war among other risks many of these challenges are present in china which represents a large potential market for semiconductor equipment and where applied anticipates significant opportunity for growth global uncertainties with respect to 1 economic growth rates in various countries 2 sustainability of demand for electronics products 3 capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 4 price weakness for certain semiconductor devices and 5 political instability in regions where applied has operations such as israel and asia may also affect applieds business financial condition and results of operations applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes applieds future success depends on performing better than its competitors in a number of ways including its ability to timely and costeffectively 1 develop new products services and technologies including those utilizing new materials such as copper 2 develop improvements to existing products services and technologies 3 develop new markets in the semiconductor industry for its products and services 4 introduce new products and services to the marketplace 5 achieve market acceptance 6 qualify new or improved products for volume manufacturing with its customers 7 commence and adjust production to meet customer demands and 8 price products and services appropriately the development introduction of and the ability to support an increasingly broader set of new or improved products and technologies including those enabling the transition to smaller device feature sizes new materials and 300mm wafers grows increasingly complex and expensive over time such new or improved products may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies compared to applieds more established products and could adversely affect applieds gross margins if applied does not develop and introduce new or improved products services and technologies in a timely and costeffective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements its competitive position financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry including more complex technology requirements the growth in asia increasing pressure on semiconductor manufacturers to allocate resources to activities that enhance their competitive advantage the increasing significance of consumer electronics as a driver for demand for semiconductors and the related focus on lower costs have in turn resulted in the increasing importance of spares and service as a growing percentage of semiconductor equipment suppliers business these changes are also requiring semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers to provide increasing levels of process integration support if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from these changes in the semiconductor industry its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base applieds customer base is highly concentrated orders from a relatively limited number of semiconductor manufacturers have accounted for and likely will continue to account for a substantial portion of applieds net sales which may lead customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to applied in addition sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter if current customers delay cancel or do not place orders applied may not be able to replace these orders with new orders as applieds products are configured to customer specifications changing rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant and often nonrecoverable costs the resulting fluctuations in the amount of or terms for orders could have a material adverse effect on applieds business financial condition and results of operations manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applieds ability to meet customer demand applieds business depends on its ability to manufacture products that meet the rapidly changing demands of its customers applieds ability to manufacture depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers significant interruptions of manufacturing operations as a result of the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts natural disasters such as earthquakes or tornadoes or other causes such as information technology or infrastructure failures regional economic downturns political instability or terrorist acts or acts of war could result in delayed product deliveries or manufacturing inefficiencies any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applieds business financial condition and results of operations applied is subject to risks of noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacturing and use of its products failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities the imposition of fines andor the suspension or termination of development manufacturing or use of certain of its products each of which could have a material adverse effect on applieds business financial condition and results of operations applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions applied has made and may in the future make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 1 diversion of managements attention from other operational matters 2 the inability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition 3 failure to commercialize purchased technology and 4 impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired company mergers and acquisitions are inherently subject to multiple significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applieds business financial condition and results of operations applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment applied is subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates and with which applied must comply and 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade for example the world trade organization wto has determined that the us foreign sales corporation fsc and extraterritorial income eti exclusion constitute a prohibited export subsidy warranting the possible imposition of trade sanctions on certain goods including semiconductor manufacturing equipment applied has benefited from fsc and eti tax provisions the elimination of these tax benefits or imposition of sanctions could materially and adversely affect applieds business financial condition and results of operations during fiscal 2002 applied filed an application with the sec for an exemptive order confirming that it is not subject to the investment company act of 1940 the act which requires companies primarily engaged in the business of investing in securities to comply with additional rules and regulations largely due to the industry downturn applieds ratios of investments to total assets and of interest income to net income have increased resulting in the risk that applied could be deemed to be covered by the act if the sec does not grant the exemption applied may have to take other actions that could adversely affect its results of operations in order not to be subject to the act applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims applied currently is and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights antitrust environmental regulations securities contracts and other matters see item 3 legal proceedings in addition from time to time applied receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and divert managements attention and resources there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims in addition applieds intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated or obsoleted by the rapid pace of technological change furthermore the laws of other countries permit the protection of applieds proprietary rights to varying extents compared to us laws applieds success is dependent in part upon the protection of its intellectual property rights infringement of applieds rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied if applied is not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of the matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applieds business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk at october 27 2002 applieds investment portfolio included fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 42 billion these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase due to the short duration of applieds investment portfolio an immediate 10 percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on applieds nearterm financial condition or results of operations applieds longterm debt bears interest primarily at fixed rates therefore applieds results of operations would be affected by interest rate changes only to the extent that variable rate shortterm notes payable are outstanding due to the shortterm nature and relatively insignificant amount of applieds shortterm notes payable an immediate 10 percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on applieds nearterm financial condition or results of operations foreign currency exchange rate risk certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies such as japanese yen euro and british pounds applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applieds results of operations for fiscal 2000 2001 or 2002 forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen euro and british pounds and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions applieds outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged therefore the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions the effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applieds nearterm financial condition or results of operations applieds downside risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option premiums paid for options outstanding at october 27 2002 were not material

competition

the global semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and is characterized by increasingly rapid technological advancements and demanding worldwide service requirements applieds ability to compete depends on its ability to commercialize its technology and continually improve its products processes and services as well as its ability to develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements significant competitive factors for succeeding in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market include the equipments technical capability productivity and costeffectiveness overall reliability ease of use and maintenance contamination and defect control and the level of technical service and support provided by the vendor the importance of each of these factors varies depending on the specific customers needs and criteria including considerations such as the customers process application product requirements timing of the purchase and particular circumstances of the purchasing decision the pace of technological change is rapid with customers continually moving to smaller critical dimensions and larger wafer sizes and adopting new materials for use in semiconductor manufacturing sometimes existing technology can be adapted to the new requirements however the new requirements sometimes create the need for an entirely new technical approach the rapid pace of technological change continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups and can quickly diminish the value of existing technologies

substantial competition exists for each of applieds products competitors range from small companies that compete with a single innovative product to companies with a large and diverse line of semiconductor processing products competitors in a given technology tend to have different degrees of market presence in the various regional markets management believes that applied is a strong competitor and that applieds competitive position is based on the ability of its products and services to continue to address customer requirements success for applied will require a continued high level of investment in rde and in sales and marketing however new products rapid changes in technology and other competitive actions from both new and existing competitors could materially and adversely affect applieds market position

patents and licenses

management believes that applieds competitive position is significantly dependent upon skills in engineering production and marketing rather than just on its patent position however protection of applieds technology assets by obtaining and enforcing patents is important therefore applied has a program to file patent applications in the us and other countries for inventions that applied considers significant applied has a number of patents in the us and other countries and additional applications are pending for new developments in its equipment and processes in addition to patents applied also possesses other proprietary intellectual property including trademarks knowhow trade secrets and copyrights

applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in applieds best interest to do so applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use in several of its products of certain patented technologies that are licensed to applied for the life of the patents applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties royalties received from third parties have not been and are not expected to be material

in the normal course of business applied from time to time receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement in dealing with such inquiries it may become necessary or useful for applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights however there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to applied on commercially reasonable terms although there can be no assurance about the outcome of existing patent infringement inquiries applied believes it is unlikely that their resolution will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 

results of operations

applied develops manufactures markets and services semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the worldwide semiconductor industry demand for applieds products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to changes in 1 global economic conditions 2 supply and demand for semiconductors 3 the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers and 4 advanced technology andor capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers for this and other reasons applieds results of operations for fiscal 1999 2000 and 2001 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results

during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001 applied implemented the securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal 2001 accordingly the first three fiscal quarters of 2001 have been restated see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements amounts prior to fiscal 2001 have not been restated

net sales applieds business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 1999 2000 and 2001 as a result of these conditions there were significant fluctuations in applieds quarterly new orders and net sales both within and across fiscal years demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors including rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes quarterly new orders and net sales were as follows

quarter  fiscal first second third fourth year       in millions 1999 new orders 1058 1461 1514 1688 5721 net sales 821 1171 1491 1613 5096 2000 new orders 2454 2928 3275 3601 12258 net sales 1722 2190 2732 2920 9564 2001 new orders 2430 1353 1208 1106 6097 net sales 2363 2139 1576 1265 7343       each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause and in the past have caused capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period net sales by geographic region were as follows

fiscal year ended 1999 2000 2001     in millions north america 1756 2598 2131 taiwan 1016 2317 1109 japan 875 1509 1876 europe 802 1430 1085 korea 345 868 449 asiapacific 302 842 693     5096 9564 7343        primarily the united states in early fiscal 1999 the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries were beginning to emerge from a downturn and entered a period of expansion as a result of the industry expansion new orders and net sales increased sequentially each quarter during fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000 strong demand for applieds products was driven by semiconductor manufacturers needs for additional capacity and new technology to meet consumer demand for internet computing communications and digital devices in addition the semiconductor industry was continuing the transition to smaller device feature sizes new materials such as copper and 300mm wafer processing which required new manufacturing equipment for fiscal 2000 applied was able to achieve record levels of new orders net sales and net income as a result of these factors during the first fiscal quarter of 2001 slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for manufacturing equipment inventory buildups in telecommunication products slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused semiconductor companies to reevaluate their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders this decline in demand deepened sequentially throughout the remainder of fiscal 2001 into a severe industry downturn due to continued weakness in the macroeconomic climate and consumption of electronic goods which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by applieds customers

gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased from 475 percent for fiscal 1999 to 508 percent for fiscal 2000 and decreased to 443 percent for fiscal 2001 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2000 was due primarily to higher business volume reduced manufacturing cycle times and the favorable effects of operational programs emphasizing productivity improvements and cost reduction the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2001 was caused primarily by decreased business volume which resulted in factory underabsorption and changes in product mix with startup costs of new 300mm products

research development and engineering applieds future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rde to ensure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced chip designs rde expenses increased for each of the last three years from 740 million 145 percent of net sales for fiscal 1999 to 11 billion 116 percent of net sales for fiscal 2000 and to 12 billion 163 percent of net sales for fiscal 2001 

applied increased its rde spending for fiscal 1999 and 2000 to address customers requirements for shrinking device feature sizes the use of new materials such as copper and the transition from 200mm to 300mm wafer processing applieds investment in research and development for copperbased devices resulted in a broad line of copperbased products available for sale in fiscal 1999 and 2000 additionally applied developed and launched many new products and enhanced versions of its existing products and technologies in fiscal 2000 including 22 new systems for 300mm wafer processing 

during fiscal 2001 applied continued its development of technologies for copper and low k based chips and 300mm wafers as well as focusing efforts on the core technologies that will be required for chipmakers to begin development of 010 micron generation devices areas of increased investment include maskmaking technology metrology and inspection ion implantation and products for depositing and etching new materials in addition significant investments were made to develop applieds process module concept the integration of multiple individual systems with metrology and inspection capabilities and specialized software for feedforwardfeedback process control these systems operate as a single highly automated unit to perform a particular wafer processing application in a customers manufacturing process to a specified level of performance

marketing selling general and administrative marketing selling general and administrative msga expenses increased from 695 million 136 percent of net sales for fiscal 1999 to 961 million 100 percent of net sales for fiscal 2000 and decreased to 902 million 123 percent of net sales for fiscal 2001 the increase for fiscal 2000 was primarily caused by higher costs of incentive and benefit programs increased investments in various information technology programs and increased costs to support higher net sales the decrease for fiscal 2001 was due primarily to cost reduction actions and lower business volume 

nonrecurring items nonrecurring items for fiscal 1999 consisted of 5 million of merger expenses related to the acquisition of consilium inc 43 million of acquired inprocess research and development expense incurred in connection with the acquisitions of akt and obsidian inc and 3 million of restructuring charges associated with etecs headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities prior to its acquisition by applied 

nonrecurring items for fiscal 2000 consisted of 40 million of merger expenses related to the acquisition of etec 

during fiscal 2001 applied recorded pretax restructuring charges of 211 million consisting of 105 million for headcount reductions 45 million for consolidation of facilities and 61 million for asset writeoffs primarily for fixed assets these restructuring actions occurred in applieds second third and fourth fiscal quarters and were taken to better align applieds cost structure with prevailing market conditions during the second fiscal quarter of 2001 applied completed a voluntary separation plan that resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 1000 employees or three percent of its global workforce for a cost of 47 million during the third fiscal quarter of 2001 applied recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 4 million associated with severance and benefit costs during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001 applied eliminated approximately 2000 additional positions or 10 percent of its global workforce for a cost of 54 million the majority of the affected employees were based in santa clara california and austin texas and represented multiple company activities and functions nonrecurring items for fiscal 2001 also included 10 million of acquired inprocess research and development expense incurred in connection with the acquisition of oramir semiconductor equipment ltd oramir 

for further details see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

nonrecurring income net net nonrecurring income of 30 million for fiscal 1999 and 68 million for fiscal 2000 were related to a 1998 litigation settlement with asm international nv for further details see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements

net interest income net interest income was 60 million for fiscal 1999 133 million for fiscal 2000 and 174 million for fiscal 2001 the increases from year to year can be attributed primarily to increasing cash and investment balances over the threeyear period 

provision for income taxes applieds effective income tax rate was 323 percent for fiscal 1999 300 percent for fiscal 2000 and 298 percent for fiscal 2001 applieds actual effective income tax rate for fiscal 1999 of 323 percent differed from the expected effective income tax rate of 310 percent due to the nontax deductible nature of 43 million of acquired inprocess research and development expense the reduction to a 300 percent effective income tax rate for fiscal 2000 resulted primarily from a shift in the geographic composition of pretax income to entities operating in countries with lower tax rates applied expected an effective income tax rate of 295 percent for fiscal 2001 which decreased from the fiscal 2000 effective rate due to a shift in the geographic composition of applieds pretax income the actual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2001 of 298 percent differed from the expected rate of 295 percent due to the nontax deductible nature of 10 million of acquired inprocess research and development expense applieds future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of applieds pretax income nontax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies 

business combinations on june 27 2001 applied acquired oramir a supplier of advanced laser cleaning technologies for semiconductor wafers in a purchase business combination for 21 million in cash for further details see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements

subsequent events

business combinations during the first fiscal quarter of 2002 applied acquired the assets of schlumbergers electronbeam wafer inspection business in addition applied acquired global knowledge services inc a provider of advanced data mining services to improve semiconductor manufacturing yield and efficiency these transactions will be accounted for as purchase business combinations these acquisitions have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on applieds financial condition or results of operations 

restructuring on december 12 2001 applied announced a further headcount reduction of approximately 1700 positions or 10 percent of its global workforce in response to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry the majority of the affected employees were based in santa clara california and austin texas and represented multiple company activities and functions applied will record a restructuring charge for the first fiscal quarter of 2002

change in accounting policy

applied implemented sab 101 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001 retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal 2001 prior to the implementation of sab 101 applied generally recognized revenue for established products upon shipment the implementation of sab 101 resulted in the following changes to applieds revenue recognition practices 1 for transactions where legal title does not transfer at shipment revenue will be recognized upon title transfer which is typically at customer technical acceptance and 2 for products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment a portion of revenue associated with certain installationrelated tasks will be recognized when the tasks are completed 

since the implementation was retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal 2001 the first three fiscal quarters of 2001 have been restated see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements applied recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of 267 million net of income tax benefit of 112 million or 031 per diluted share for the restated first fiscal quarter of 2001 this charge represents the aftertax difference between the new and previous revenue recognition policies for years prior to fiscal 2001 as of the implementation date at the beginning of fiscal 2001 therefore no restatement of years prior to fiscal 2001 is required for periods prior to fiscal 2001 data was not available to provide pro forma information as if the change in accounting principle was applied retroactively the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of 267 million included 651 million of revenue recognized prior to fiscal 2001 of which 642 million was recognized during fiscal 2001

recent accounting pronouncements

in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 sfas 141 business combinations sfas 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 and eliminates the poolingofinterests method applied does not expect the adoption of sfas 141 to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations

in july 2001 the fasb issued sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets which requires the discontinuance of goodwill amortization sfas 142 is required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 with certain early adoption permitted applied expects to adopt sfas 142 for its first fiscal quarter of 2002 and does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated retirement costs applied is in the process of assessing the effect of adopting sfas 143 which will be effective for applieds fiscal 2003

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas 144 supersedes sfas 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of applied is in the process of assessing the effect of adopting sfas 144 which will be effective for applieds fiscal 2003

financial condition liquidity and capital resources

applied increased its cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments from 42 billion at october 29 2000 to 48 billion at october 28 2001 applieds financial condition remained strong with a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 321 at october 29 2000 and 511 at october 28 2001 

applied generated cash from continuing operations in each of the last three fiscal years the primary source of cash from continuing operations has been income from continuing operations as adjusted to exclude the effect of noncash items such as depreciation and amortization and acquired inprocess research and development expense income from continuing operations adjusted to exclude the effect of noncash items was 12 billion for fiscal 1999 26 billion for fiscal 2000 and 14 billion for fiscal 2001 the other source or use of cash from continuing operations has been attributable to changes in assets and liabilities other than those assets and liabilities resulting from investing and financing activities net changes in assets and liabilities tend to represent a use of cash during periods of revenue growth because applied generally incurs costs and expends cash in advance of receiving cash from its customers likewise during periods of declining revenue or slowed revenue growth net changes in assets and liabilities tend to represent a source of cash because expenditures for inventory and other purchases decrease while receivables from prior periods which were higher revenue periods are collected the cash effect of changes in assets and liabilities was a 116 million use for fiscal 1999 a 923 million use for fiscal 2000 and a 139 million source for fiscal 2001 

in addition to being driven by revenue and profitability performance the cash effect of changes in assets and liabilities is subject to operational efficiency and productivity for example earlier collection of accounts receivable and increased inventory turnover both have a positive effect on cash flow applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of 953 million for fiscal 1999 15 billion for fiscal 2000 and 12 billion for fiscal 2001 these receivable sales had the effect of increasing cash and reducing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding applied has not experienced any losses under these programs and receivables sold under these programs have terms and credit risk characteristics similar to applieds overall receivables portfolio for further details regarding accounts receivable sales see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

applied used 982 million of cash for investing activities for fiscal 1999 10 billion for fiscal 2000 and 16 billion for fiscal 2001 investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales of shortterm investments purchases of capital assets to support longterm growth and acquisitions of technology or of other companies to allow applied to access new market segments or emerging technology 

applied generated 127 million of cash from financing activities for fiscal 1999 generated 149 million for fiscal 2000 and used 261 million for fiscal 2001 financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of applieds common stock as well as borrowings and repayments of debt net debt activity used 17 million of cash for fiscal 1999 generated 50 million of cash for fiscal 2000 and used 92 million of cash for fiscal 2001 net common stock activity generated 144 million of cash for fiscal 1999 and 99 million for fiscal 2000 as a result of a significant increase in stock sales to employees reflecting applieds higher average stock price partially offset by stock repurchases during fiscal 2001 net common stock activity used 169 million of cash as stock repurchases increased and stock sales to employees decreased reflecting applieds lower average stock price in fiscal 2001 since march 1996 applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to partially fund its stockbased employee benefit and incentive plans

at october 28 2001 applieds principal sources of liquidity consisted of 48 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and approximately 686 million of available credit facilities for further details regarding applieds credit facilities see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements in addition to cash and available credit facilities applied may from time to time raise additional capital in the debt and equity markets applieds liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors applieds management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy applieds liquidity requirements for the next 12 months

trends risks and uncertainties

the highly cyclical semiconductor equipment industry is currently experiencing a severe prolonged downturn as suppliers to the semiconductor industry the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by up and down business cycles the timing length and volatility of which are difficult to predict the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and capacity requirements including capacity utilizing the latest technology these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology these industry cycles create pressure on applieds net sales gross margin and net income in addition to affecting applieds suppliers these cycles challenge key management engineering and other employees who are vital to applieds success

management believes that the current industry downturn may be the steepest decline in history and cannot predict when a recovery will begin during periods of declining demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment customers typically reduce purchases delay delivery of products andor cancel orders during this downturn applied must be able to quickly and effectively align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions and motivate and retain key employees if applied is unable to achieve its objectives in a timely manner during the current downturn there could be a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

applied is exposed to the risks associated with industry overcapacity inventory buildups in telecommunication products slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth have dramatically decreased demand for semiconductors this decreased demand has resulted in excess production capacity for semiconductor manufacturers and has caused these manufacturers to reevaluate their capital spending plans delays or cancellations of orders by semiconductor manufacturers have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in the utilization of applieds manufacturing facilities continued decreased demand and overcapacity could materially and adversely affect applieds business financial condition and results of operations

applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business currently a significant percentage of applieds revenues result from sales outside the us certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers are also located abroad managing applieds global operations presents challenges including periodic regional economic downturns trade balance issues varying business conditions and demands political instability us export restrictions shipping delays fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and cultural diversities among other risks for example global uncertainties with respect to 1 decreased growth rates of gross domestic product in various countries 2 factory capacity utilization 3 capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 4 memory chip price weakness and 5 political instability in regions where applied has operations such as israel and the asian region may affect applieds business financial condition and results of operations 

applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes applieds competitive advantage and future success depend on its ability to successfully 1 develop new products and technologies 2 develop new markets in the semiconductor industry for its products and services 3 introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner 4 qualify new products with its customers and 5 commence and adjust production to meet customer demands the introduction of an increasingly broader set of new products and technologies including those to support the transition to smaller device feature sizes new materials and 300mm wafers grows increasingly complex over time such new product introductions may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies compared to applieds more established products and could adversely affect applieds gross margins if applied does not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely and costeffective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements its competitive position financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions applied has made and may in the future make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 1 diversion of managements attention from other operational matters 2 lack of synergy or the inability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition 3 failure to commercialize purchased technology and 4 acquired intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired company mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applieds business financial condition and results of operations 

applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base applieds customer base is highly concentrated orders from a relatively limited number of semiconductor manufacturers have accounted for and will continue to account for a substantial portion of applieds net sales sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter if current customers do not continue to place orders applied may not be able to replace these orders with new orders from new customers the resulting fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on applieds business financial condition and results of operations

applied is subject to risks of noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its business operations including but not limited to regulations related to the development manufacturing and use of its products from time to time applied receives notices alleging violations of these regulations it is applieds policy to respond promptly to these notices and to take necessary corrective action failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities the imposition of fines andor the suspension or termination of development manufacturing or use of certain of its products each of which could have a material adverse effect on applieds business financial condition and results of operations

manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applieds ability to meet customer demand applieds business depends on its ability to manufacture products that meet the rapidly changing demands of its customers applieds ability to manufacture depends in part on the timely delivery of parts components and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers significant interruptions of manufacturing operations as a result of the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts natural disasters such as earthquakes or tornadoes or other causes such as software issues or infrastructure failures could result in delayed product deliveries or manufacturing inefficiencies any or all of these could materially and adversely affect applieds business financial condition and results of operations 

applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims applied currently is and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights antitrust environmental regulations contracts and other matters see item 3 legal proceedings these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and could divert managements attention and resources there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims in addition applieds intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented invalidated or obsoleted by the rapid pace of technological change furthermore the laws of other countries permit the protection of applieds proprietary rights to varying extents compared to us laws applieds success is dependent in part upon the protection of its intellectual property rights infringement of applieds rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied if applied is not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of the matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend its position applieds business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk at october 28 2001 applieds investment portfolio included fixedincome securities with a fair value of approximately 40 billion these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase due to the short duration of applieds investment portfolio an immediate 10 percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on applieds nearterm financial condition or results of operations

applieds longterm debt bears interest at fixed rates therefore applieds results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to the extent that variable rate shortterm notes payable are outstanding due to the shortterm nature and insignificant amount of applieds shortterm notes payable an immediate 10 percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on applieds nearterm financial condition or results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk significant operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies primarily japanese yen applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of but not all certain existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applieds results of operations for fiscal 1999 2000 or 2001

forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions applieds outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged therefore the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions the effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applieds nearterm financial condition or results of operations applieds downside risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option premiums paid for options outstanding at october 28 2001 were not material
