regulation

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbott’s products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices in addition abbott’s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation including registration certification and licensure by federal state and local agencies such as the centers for medicare  medicaid services the drug enforcement administration the substance abuse and mental health services administration and their respective foreign counterparts certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance quality control and personnel standards and undergo inspections

during the covid19 public health emergency many pandemicrelated products including diagnostic tests were authorized by regulators for emergency use solely during the pandemic in addition many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus examples include expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing it is uncertain when the public health emergency will end and to what extent these policies will continue or revert back to previous policies

abbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries these may require local investment restrict abbott’s investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products

abbott’s laboratory facilities home monitoring servicesand durable medical equipment suppliers which provide services related products and medical devices to consumers are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to thirdparty payors in the united states medicare medicaid and other thirdparty payors may from time to time conduct inquiries claims audits investigations and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria

abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback antiselfreferral and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbott’s business among other effects health care regulations and significant changes thereto such as the introduction of the medical device regulation and the in vitro diagnostic medical device regulation in the european union substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in developing obtaining and maintaining approval to market and marketing newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale suspension or revocation of billing privileges and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties similarly compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions including suspension revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s certification which is necessary to conduct business as well as significant fines or criminal penalties

abbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbott’s products for the foreseeable future in the united states the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices diagnostics supplies and other products as well as the procedures in which these products may be used the government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time for example medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies additionally the protecting access to medicare act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018

the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which requires manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare  medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure in october 2018 the substance use disorder prevention that promotes opioid recovery and treatment for patients and communities act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required beginning with reports filed in 2022 similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties

policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems in the united states this could include potential modification including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the affordable care act

the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information including patient health information financial information and other sensitive personal information is increasing for example the european union china various other countries and various us states eg california virginia and colorado have enacted data protection laws that contain significant compliance obligations and financial penalties for noncompliance in addition regulators with general consumer protection authority such as the federal trade commission and us states attorneys general are focused on how consumer data is used by entities in the health care industry further there are regulations of data privacy and security that are specific to health care companies for example the us department of health and human services has issued rules governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information and the fda has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices in addition certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended and abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area 

governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbott’s nutritional products business in the united states for example under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program

abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture quality assurance requirements marketing authorization processes postmarket surveillance requirements availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above

 item 1a risk factors

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbott’s securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbott’s actual results abbott’s business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks

business and operational risks

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbott’s credit rating result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and decrease liquidity

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks in addition third party hacking attempts may cause abbott’s information technology systems and related products protected data or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen a significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences including increased costs and expenses manufacturing challenges or disruption problems with product functionality damage to customer relations reputational damage lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties

abbott also collects manages and processes protected personal data including protected health information in connection with certain medical products and service offerings abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders for additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation see the discussion in “regulation” under item 1 “business” a breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences including regulatory inquiries or litigation increased costs and expenses reputational damage lost revenue and fines or penalties

abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future similarly there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like abbott any significant breach attack or other disruption involving abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s business

abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested

promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbott’s existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry or regulatory standards or competitors’ innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or technologies or new indications or uses for existing products may cause abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete causing abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer

the manufacture of many of abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbott’s business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials or the global supply chain cyber attacks natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product those products may have to be discarded if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred any of these events could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other lots batches or products to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and profitability

abbott has significant indebtedness which could adversely affect its business including decreasing its business flexibility 

as of december 31 2021 abbotts consolidated indebtedness was approximately 181 billion this consolidated indebtedness could have the effect among other things of reducing abbotts flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes

further abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes abbotts ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors abbotts financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond abbotts control consequently abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to abbott or at all which could adversely impact abbotts ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition

additionally further borrowing could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit ratings abbotts credit ratings reflect each credit rating agencys then opinion of abbotts financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations adverse changes in abbotts credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities and may limit financing options including access to the unsecured borrowing market abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility

legal and regulatory risks 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug medical device diagnostic product or nutritional product can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts many of abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbott’s products and criminal prosecution

these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbott’s business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbott’s products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while abbott or abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues profitability and financial condition

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbott’s industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs in the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues profitability and financial condition

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbott’s business 

both in the us and internationally government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs make adverse decisions relating to abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement or make changes to patient access to health care all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of abbott’s products or the prices that abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them

further in the us a number of the provisions of the affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 address access to health care products and services these provisions may be modified expanded repealed or otherwise invalidated in whole or in part future rulemaking could affect rebates prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or required reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law

for additional information concerning health care regulation see the discussion in “regulation” under item 1 “business”

the expiration or loss of intellectual property protection and licenses may affect abbott’s future revenues and operating income 

many of abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbott’s businesses could suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbott’s intellectual property rights abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced any material litigation regarding abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “legal proceedings”

significant safety concerns could arise for abbott’s products which could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbott’s products

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits safety alerts or product recalls and other allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbott’s business and reputation and on abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s profitability and financial condition

economic and industry risks 

abbott is subject to risks related to public health crises such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the covid19 pandemic 

as a global healthcare company public health crises such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact abbotts operations health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause significant reductions in demand for certain products increased difficulty in serving customers disrupt manufacturing and supply chains and negatively affect abbott’s operations as well as the operations of its suppliers distributors and other thirdparty partners furthermore such widespread outbreaks may impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

to date the covid19 pandemic has affected abbotts diversified health care business in various ways with some businesses performing at the levels required to successfully meet new demands other having faced challenges during periods when the number of covid19 cases significantly increased and still others being relatively less impacted by the pandemic

with regard to covid19 diagnostic testing the fda issued emergency use authorizations euas for several covid19 related products in 2020 and 2021 including abbott diagnostic tests euas are authorized for the duration of the covid19 public health emergency unless sooner terminated or revoked abbott is actively pursuing the fda’s customary regulatory approval process for various covid19 diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in “ abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes ” in “legal and regulatory risks” under “item 1a risk factors” further the demand for covid19 tests has been and abbott expects it to continue to be highly volatile primarily driven by the emergence and severity of new variants which are unpredictable

in addition the covid19 pandemic has contributed to global supply chain disruptions which has adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials supplies and services while abbott has taken actions to offset some of these inflationary pressures in its supply chain abbott may not be able to completely offset all the increases in its operational costs further abbott has experienced and may continue to experience availability issues with some services and materials used in its products to date abbott has been able to manage these challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services raw materials and supplies however no assurance can be given that these efforts will continue to be successful significant disruptions or shortages may result in abbott’s inability to meet customer demand for certain of its products

due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current covid19 pandemic the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will have a material effect on abbott’s business financial condition or results of operations is uncertain a more detailed discussion on the impact of the covid19 pandemic on abbott’s business is contained in the “financial review” section in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “regulation” to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced

competitors’ intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbott’s future profitability and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

financial review

abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and the measurement of net sales and costs is impacted by foreign currency translation abbott’s primary products are medical devices diagnostic testing products nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals sales in international markets comprise approximately 61 percent of consolidated net sales

in 2020 and 2021 the coronavirus covid19 pandemic affected abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways as is further described below some businesses have performed at the levels required to successfully meet new demands others have faced challenges during periods when the number of covid19 cases significantly increased and still others have been relatively less impacted by the pandemic

abbott’s diagnostics segment experienced the most significant change in sales from 2019 to 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch various new diagnostic tests for covid19 

in march 2020 rapid diagnostics launched a molecular test to detect covid19 on its id now ® rapid pointofcare platform in the us pursuant to an emergency use authorization eua in august 2020 abbott launched its binaxnow ® covid19 ag card test a portable lateral flow rapid test to detect covid19 pursuant to an eua in the us in december 2020 abbott received an eua in the us for virtually guided athome use of its binaxnow covid19 ag card rapid test and launched the product for athome use in march 2021 abbott announced that it had received an eua in the us for its overthecounter nonprescription binaxnow covid19 ag self test for individuals with or without symptoms in the first quarter of 2021 abbott also received euas in the us that allow the nonprescription use of the binaxnow covid19 ag card home test and the binaxnow covid19 ag card test for professional use for individuals with or without symptoms

outside the us in september 2020 rapid diagnostics launched its panbio ® rapid antigen test to detect covid19 pursuant to a ce mark in october 2020 abbott received approval by the world health organization for emergency use listing for the panbio antigen test in january 2021 abbott received ce mark for two new uses of its panbio rapid antigen test asymptomatic testing and selfswabbing under the supervision of a healthcare worker in june 2021 abbott announced that it had received ce mark for its overthecounter panbio covid19 antigen selftest for individuals with or without symptoms

in 2020 molecular diagnostics developed and launched molecular tests to detect covid19 using polymerase chain reaction pcr methods on its m2000 ® realti m e labbased platform and its alinity ® m system pursuant to euas in the us and ce marks molecular diagnostics also developed and launched its multiplex molecular test on its alinity m system to detect covid19 influenza a influenza b and respiratory syncytial virus rsv in one test this multiplex molecular test was launched pursuant to a ce mark in december 2020 and an eua in the us in march 2021

in 2020 and 2021 core laboratory diagnostics developed and launched various labbased serology blood tests on its architect ® i1000sr ® and architect i2000sr ® laboratory instruments and on its alinity i system for the detection of an antibody to determine if someone was previously infected with the virus the tests were launched under euas in the us and ce marks

in 2020 and 2021 abbott’s covid19 testingrelated sales totaled approximately 39 billion and 77 billion respectively led by sales related to abbott’s binaxnow panbio and id now rapid testing platforms 2021 volumes were affected by fluctuations in the number of covid19 cases especially in the us over the course of the year in the second quarter of 2021 demand for covid19 tests decreased from the previous quarter as covid19 vaccines were administered covid19 cases and hospitalizations declined and the us health authority updated its guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals however in the second half of 2021 as the delta and omicron variants of covid19 spread and the number of new covid19 cases increased demand for rapid covid19 tests increased significantly

with respect to other products sold by the diagnostics segment demand for routine diagnostic testing generally fluctuated as the number of covid19 cases changed in various geographic regions throughout the twoyear period in 2020 in addition to negatively impacting routine core diagnostic testing volumes the pandemic negatively affected the number of cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures performed by health care providers globally thereby reducing the demand for abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices and routine diagnostic tests the decrease began in february 2020 in china as that country implemented quarantine restrictions and postponed nonemergency health care activities the negative impact on cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures and routine diagnostic tests expanded to other countries and geographic regions as covid19 spread geographically in the first half of 2020 and health care systems in these countries shifted their focus to fighting covid19

the extent of the impact and the timing of a recovery in the number of procedures and routine testing in a particular country or geographic region depended upon the progression of covid19 cases in that country or region as well as the actions taken by the government in that country related to covid19 in 2020 the recovery in procedures and routine testing volumes in china began in march 2020 in other parts of the world such as the us and europe volumes improved across abbott’s hospitalbased businesses as the second quarter progressed and the improvement continued in the third quarter however in the fourth quarter of 2020 the improving trends in the demand for procedures and routine testing flattened or were negatively impacted depending upon the business and the region as many countries including the us experienced an increase in the number of covid19 cases and hospitalizations 

while routine diagnostic testing and cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedure volumes were negatively impacted early in 2021 by elevated covid19 case rates overall volumes improved over the course of the year until the latter part of 2021 when demand softened in several geographies with the emergence of another variant

while abbott’s branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as covid19 spread across emerging market countries in the second and third quarters of 2020 volumes recovered and grew in 2021 abbott’s nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic as is further discussed below

abbott is continually monitoring the effects of the pandemic on its operations throughout the pandemic abbott has continued to ensure that its operations throughout the world are aligned with the specific governmental orders and guidelines affecting each location abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure to covid19 and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees

the demand for covid19 tests has been highly volatile abbott expects this volatility to continue as the possible emergence and severity of new variants are unpredictable due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the covid19 pandemic the extent to which the pandemic will have a material effect on abbott’s business financial condition or results of operations is uncertain

while abbott’s 2021 and 2020 sales were most significantly affected by the covid19 pandemic the increase in total sales over the last three years also reflects the introduction of new products across various businesses as well as higher sales of various existing products sales in emerging markets which represent approximately 35 percent of total company sales increased 196 percent in 2021 and 20 percent in 2020 excluding the impact of foreign exchange emerging markets include all countries except the united states western europe japan canada australia and new zealand

over the last three years abbott’s operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 142 percent in 2019 to 155 percent in 2020 and 196 percent in 2021 the increase in 2021 from 2020 reflects the impact of sales volume increases for covid19 tests in rapid diagnostics and growth across virtually all of abbott’s businesses due in part to recovery from the covid19 pandemic partially offset by the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges on various manufacturing inputs and transportation costs an increase in restructuring costs and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange the increase in 2020 reflects the sales volume increases in the rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses partially offset by lower medical devices sales due to the impact of the pandemic and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange in addition a reduction in the costs associated with business acquisitions and restructuring activities drove an improvement in operating margins from 2019 to 2020

in 2021 abbott experienced availability issues with some services and materials used in its products to date abbott has been able to manage the various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services raw materials and supplies while abbott expects inflationary pressures on various raw materials packaging materials and transportation costs to continue in 2022 the impact of such cost increases is expected to be at least partially mitigated by price increases in certain businesses and the impact of continued gross margin improvement initiatives to the extent that supply chain challenges in the industries in which abbott operates normalize over time this may lessen inflationary pressures

with respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years sales in the medical devices segment excluding the impact of foreign exchange increased 194 percent in 2021 and decreased 38 percent in 2020 the sales increase in 2021 was driven by doubledigit growth across all of abbott’s medical devices divisions led by diabetes care structural heart and electrophysiology the sales decrease in 2020 was driven by abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due primarily to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the covid19 pandemic these decreases were partially offset by doubledigit growth in diabetes care

in 2021 operating earnings for the medical devices segment increased 486 percent the operating margin profile increased from 308 percent of sales in 2019 to 314 percent in 2021 primarily due to higher sales volumes in diabetes care and abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses this growth was partially offset by pricing pressures on drug eluting stents des as a result of market competition in the us and other major markets

in 2021 key product approvals in the medical devices segment included

 

in abbott’s worldwide diagnostics business sales increased 427 percent in 2021 and 406 percent in 2020 excluding the impact of foreign exchange as was discussed above sales growth in 2021 was driven by demand for abbotts portfolio of rapid diagnostics tests for covid19 and higher routine diagnostics testing in the core laboratory business partially offset by lower demand for abbott’s laboratorybased tests for covid19 in the molecular diagnostics business growth in 2020 was driven by demand for abbotts portfolio of covid19 diagnostics tests across its rapid and labbased platforms partially offset by lower volumes of routine laboratory testing due to the pandemic

abbott has regulatory approvals in the us europe china and other markets for the “alinity c” and “alinity i” instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the “alinity h” instrument for hematology in europe and japan abbott has also obtained regulatory approvals in the us europe and other markets for the “alinity s” blood screening and “alinity m” molecular instruments and several testing assays

in 2021 operating earnings for the diagnostics segment increased 680 percent the operating margin profile increased from 248 percent of sales in 2019 to 400 percent in 2021 primarily due to higher sales in rapid diagnostics in 2020 and 2021 and increased routine diagnostics testing in 2021 in core laboratory diagnostics

in abbott’s worldwide nutritional products business sales over the last three years were positively impacted by numerous new product introductions including the rollouts of human milk oligosaccharide or hmo in infant formula that leveraged abbott’s strong brands sales over the last two years were also positively impacted by consumers’ interest in nutrients that help support their immune systems excluding the impact of foreign exchange total adult nutrition sales increased 128 percent in 2021 and 103 percent in 2020 led by the continued growth of ensure ®  abbott’s marketleading complete and balanced nutrition brand and glucerna ®  abbott’s marketleading diabetesspecific nutrition brand across several countries excluding the impact of foreign exchange total pediatric nutrition sales increased 33 percent in 2021 and 03 percent in 2020 driven by the pedialyte ®  pediasure ® and similac ® brands in the us as well as infant and toddler product growth across several international markets partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in greater china operating margins for the worldwide nutritional products business decreased from 230 percent in 2019 to 213 percent in 2021 the decrease was driven by higher manufacturing and distribution costs including commodity prices partially offset by the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives

the established pharmaceutical products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets excluding the impact of foreign exchange established pharmaceutical sales increased 104 percent in 2021 and 19 percent in 2020 the sales increases in 2021 and 2020 reflect higher sales in several geographies including india china brazil and russia operating margins decreased from 201 percent of sales in 2019 to 188 percent in 2021 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange higher product costs and product mix partially offset by the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives

with respect to abbott’s financial position at december 31 2021 abbott’s cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments total approximately 102 billion compared to 71 billion at december 31 2020 abbott’s longterm debt and shortterm borrowings total 181 billion and 187 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively

abbott declared dividends of 182 per share in 2021 compared to 153 per share in 2020 an increase of approximately 19 percent dividends paid totaled 3202 billion in 2021 compared to 2560 billion in 2020 the yearoveryear change in the amount of dividends paid primarily reflects the increase in the dividend rate in december 2021 abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by 44 percent to 047 per share from 045 per share effective with the dividend paid in february 2022 in december 2020 abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by 25 percent to 045 per share from 036 per share effective with the dividend paid in february 2021

critical accounting policies

sales rebates — in 2021 approximately 45 percent of abbott’s consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances in 2021 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care businesses abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2021 2020 and 2019 amounted to approximately 39 billion 33 billion and 31 billion respectively or 175 percent 201 percent and 191 percent of gross sales respectively based on gross sales of approximately 223 billion 166 billion and 163 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 223 million in 2021 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 268 million 207 million and 169 million for cash discounts in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively and 211 million 232 million and 192 million for returns in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbott’s historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals in the wic business estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott holds the wic contract the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price is reliably determinable rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the us department of agriculture usda and the states submitting rebate claims the usda which administers the wic program has been making its data available for many years management also estimates the states processing lag time based on sales and claims data inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially management has access to several large customers inventory management data which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel at december 31 2021 abbott had wic business in 36 states

historically adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items is often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for years can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs the impact of higher interest rates and improved asset returns during 2021 significantly decreased the net actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2021 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss were net losses of 31 billion for abbott’s defined benefit plans and net losses of 373 million for abbott’s medical and dental plans actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott’s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december 31 2021 goodwill amounted to 232 billion and net intangibles amounted to 127 billion amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to 20 billion in 2021 21 billion in 2020 and 19 billion in 2019 there was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2021 2020 and 2019

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 450 “contingencies” under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 30 million to 45 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 40 million have been recorded at december 31 2021 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 “contingencies”

in medical devices sales increased 194 percent and decreased 38 percent in 2021 and 2020 respectively excluding the effect of foreign exchange in 2021 the increase was driven by doubledigit growth across all divisions led by diabetes care structural heart and electrophysiology in 2020 doubledigit growth in diabetes care was more than offset by decreases in abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due to the impact of covid19 and lower vascular sales in china in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of a new national tender program

the 2021 and 2020 growth in diabetes care revenue was driven by continued growth of freestyle libre abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system internationally and in the us in 2021 freestyle libre sales totaled 37 billion which reflected a 368 percent increase over 2020 excluding the effect of foreign exchange freestyle libre sales in 2020 were 26 billion which reflected a 426 percent increase excluding the effect of foreign exchange over 2019 when sales totaled 18 billion

while procedure volumes across abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted early in 2021 by elevated covid19 case rates in certain countries including the us overall volumes improved over the course of 2021 across various businesses the yearoveryear increases in the various businesses reflect a recovery from the 2020 levels when the pandemic reduced procedure volumes as well as sales growth from prepandemic levels in structural heart electrophysiology and heart failure excluding the effect of foreign exchange in january 2021 the us centers for medicare  medicaid services expanded reimbursement coverage eligibility for mitraclip ®  abbotts marketleading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation mr a leaky heart valve the growth in structural heart during 2021 was broadbased across several areas of the business including mitraclip and triclip ®  the world’s first minimally invasive clipbased device for repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve which was launched in europe in may 2020

abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott’s revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were not significant in 2021 2020 and 2019

the expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect abbott

operating earnings

gross profit margins were 522 percent of net sales in 2021 505 percent in 2020 and 525 percent in 2019 in 2021 the increase primarily reflects the effects of higher sales volume higher manufacturing utilization and the nonrecurrence of the 2020 impairment of intangible assets partially offset by increases in various manufacturing costs and the impact of higher restructuring charges in 2020 the decrease primarily reflects the mix of sales across abbott’s various businesses and operational inefficiencies due to the impact of covid19 as well as the increase in intangible asset amortization the impairment of intangible assets and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin

research and development rd expenses were 27 billion in 2021 and 24 billion in both 2020 and 2019 the increase in 2021 rd spending was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development rd spending in 2020 was relatively flat compared to 2019 as the impact of the immediate expensing in 2019 of an rd asset valued at 102 million that was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of cephea valve technologies inc was partially offset by the 55 million impairment of an inprocess rd intangible asset in 2020 rd expense in 2020 also reflects lower integration and restructuring costs in 2020 related to rd partially offset by higher spending on various projects

selling general and administrative sga expenses increased 168 percent in 2021 due primarily to higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses and the nonrecurrence of 100 million of income in 2020 from a litigation settlement the increase in 2021 also includes charges related to certain litigation sga expenses were basically flat in 2020 compared to 2019 in 2020 the favorable effect of foreign exchange income of approximately 100 million from a litigation settlement in 2020 lower spending due to covid19 travel restrictions and the impact of various cost saving initiatives were offset by higher spending to drive growth in various businesses

restructurings 

on may 27 2021 abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its diagnostic products segment to align its manufacturing network for covid19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand driven by several factors including significant reductions in cases in the us and other major developed countries the accelerated rollout of covid19 vaccines globally and the us health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals in the second quarter of 2021 abbott recorded charges of 499 million under this plan in cost of products sold the charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset writedowns of 80 million inventoryrelated charges of 248 million and other exit costs which included contract cancellations and employeerelated costs of 171 million

research and development programs

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical devices diagnostic and nutritional products in development

research and development process 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment’s existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity

depending upon the product the phases of development may include

 

the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to six or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include

 

the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fda’s premarket approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a biological license application bla

in the european union eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which has been governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to declare conformity to the directive other products only require a selfcertification process in 2017 the eu adopted the new in vitro diagnostic regulation ivdr which replaces the existing directive in the eu for in vitro diagnostic products and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products in december 2021 the ivdr was amended to extend the regulation’s previous twoyear transition period by one to three years with the transition period extending to may 2027 for certain devices however the amendment does not delay the date of application of the ivdr itself which will take effect on may 26 2022

in the medical devices segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation selection and qualification of a product design completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product’s safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us medical devices are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbott’s medical device products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process

in the eu medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which had been governed by the european medical device directive and the active implantable medical device directive varies by class in the second quarter of 2017 the eu adopted the new medical devices regulation mdr which replaced the existing directives in the eu for medical devices and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products the mdr applies to manufacturers as of may 26 2021 after a fouryear transition period each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the mdr

some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions

after approval and commercial launch of some medical devices postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants and adults or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a product’s efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fda’s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutritional products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products

areas of focus

in 2022 and beyond abbott’s significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following

established pharmaceuticals — abbott focuses on building countryspecific portfolios made up of highquality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets over the next several years abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new offpatent and differentiated medicines in addition abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as creon™ duphaston™ duphalac™ and influvac™ depending on the product the activities focus on development of new data markets formulations delivery systems or indications

medical devices — abbott’s research and development programs focus on

 

nutritionals — abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas gastro intestinalimmunity health brain health mobility and metabolism and user experience platforms numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development including clinical outcome testing and are expected to be launched over the coming years

core laboratory diagnostics — abbott continues to commercialize its nextgeneration blood and plasma screening immunoassay clinical chemistry and hematology systems along with assays including a focus on unmet medical need in various areas including infectious disease cardiac care metabolics and oncology as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories

molecular diagnostics — several new molecular in vitro diagnostic ivd tests are in various stages of development and launch

rapid diagnostics — abbott’s research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease cardiometabolic disease and toxicology

in addition the diagnostics segment is pursuing the fda’s customary regulatory process for various covid19 tests for which euas were obtained 

given the diversity of abbott’s business its intention to remain a broadbased health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbott’s total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbott’s overall market position there were no delays in abbott’s 2021 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbott’s ability to successfully finish each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates and such spending is targeted at approximately 7 percent of total abbott sales in 2022 abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period

goodwill

at december 31 2021 goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled 232 billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value

financial condition

cash flow

net cash from operating activities amounted to 105 billion 79 billion and 61 billion in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2021 was primarily due to the favorable cash flow impact of higher segment operating earnings and improved working capital management partially offset by higher cash taxes paid and the net impact of litigation settlements the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to the favorable cash flow impact of higher segment operating earnings lower payments related to interest integration expenses and restructuring actions and the proceeds from a litigation settlement partially offset by an increased investment in working capital and higher income tax payments

a substantial portion of abbott’s cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 is held by abbott affiliates outside of the us if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds

abbott funded 418 million in 2021 400 million in 2020 and 382 million in 2019 to defined benefit pension plans abbott expects pension funding of approximately 415 million in 2022 for its pension plans abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbott’s capital expenditures and cash dividends

debt and capital

working capital

working capital was 111 billion at december 31 2021 and 85 billion at december 31 2020 the increase was due in large part to the higher level of cash and cash equivalents which was due primarily to the increase in cash generated from operating activities partially offset by the classification of 750 million of senior notes due 2022 as current liabilities at december 31 2021 and an increase in accounts payable associated with the growth of the business

financial instruments and risk management

market price sensitive investments

the fair value of equity securities held by abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately 11 million and 20 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively these equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value a hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at december 31 2021 by approximately 2 million changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings the fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately 391 million and 366 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively changes in the fair value of these investments as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation are recorded in earnings

nonpublicly traded equity securities

abbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges the carrying value of these investments was 90 million and 113 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively no individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of 15 million abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer

interest rate sensitive financial instruments

at december 31 2021 and 2020 abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 29 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged abbott does not use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities the fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2021 and 2020 amounted to 212 billion and 228 billion respectively average interest rates of 34 and 33 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively with maturities through 2046 at december 31 2021 and 2020 the fair value of current and longterm investment securities amounted to approximately 13 billion and 11 billion respectively a hypothetical 100basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows income or fair values

foreign currency sensitive financial instruments

certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are markedtomarket with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold generally within the next twelve to eighteen months at december 31 2021 and 2020 abbott held 86 billion and 81 billion respectively of such contracts contracts held at december 31 2021 will mature in 2022 or 2023 depending upon the contract contracts held at december 31 2020 matured in 2021 or will mature in 2022 depending upon the contract

abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and thirdparty trade payables and receivables the contracts are markedtomarket and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed at december 31 2021 and 2020 abbott held 122 billion and 110 billion respectively of such contracts which mature in the next 13 months

in november 2019 abbott borrowed ¥598 billion under a 5year term loan and designated the yendenominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the proceeds equated to approximately 550 million the value of this longterm debt was approximately 521 million and 577 million as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively the change in the value of the debt which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax

regulation

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbott’s products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices in addition abbott’s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation including registration certification and licensure by federal state and local agencies such as the centers for medicare  medicaid services the drug enforcement administration the substance abuse and mental health services administration and their respective foreign counterparts certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance quality control and personnel standards and undergo inspections

during the covid19 public health emergency many pandemicrelated products including diagnostic tests were authorized by regulators for emergency use solely during the pandemic in addition many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus examples include expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing it is uncertain when the public health emergency will end and to what extent these policies will continue or revert back to previous policies

abbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries these may require local investment restrict abbott’s investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products

abbott’s laboratory facilities and home monitoring services which provide services related products and medical devices to consumers are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to thirdparty payors in the united states medicare medicaid and other thirdparty payors may from time to time conduct inquiries claims audits investigations and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria

abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback antiselfreferral and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbott’s business among other effects health care regulations and significant changes thereto such as the introduction of the medical device regulation and the in vitro diagnostic medical device regulation in the european union substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in developing obtaining and maintaining approval to market and marketing newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale suspension or revocation of billing privileges and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties similarly compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions including suspension revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s certification which is necessary to conduct business as well as significant fines or criminal penalties

abbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbott’s products for the foreseeable future in the united states the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices diagnostics supplies and other products as well as the procedures in which these products may be used the government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time for example medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies additionally the protecting access to medicare act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018

the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which requires manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare  medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure in october 2018 the substance use disorder prevention that promotes opioid recovery and treatment for patients and communities act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required beginning with reports filed in 2022 similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties

policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems in the united states this could include potential modification including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the affordable care act

the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information including patient health information financial information and other sensitive personal information is increasing for example the european union various other countries and various us states eg california have enacted stricter data protection laws that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance similarly the us department of health and human services has issued rules governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information and the fda has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices in addition certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended and abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area

governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbott’s nutritional products business in the united states for example under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program

abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture quality assurance requirements marketing authorization processes postmarket surveillance requirements availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above

 item 1a risk factors

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbott’s securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbott’s actual results abbott’s business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks

business and operational risks

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbott’s credit rating result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and decrease liquidity

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks in addition third party hacking attempts may cause abbott’s information technology systems and related products protected data or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen a significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences including increased costs and expenses manufacturing challenges or disruption problems with product functionality damage to customer relations lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties

abbott also collects manages and processes protected personal data including protected health information in connection with certain medical products and service offerings abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders for additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation see the discussion in “regulation” under item 1 “business” a breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences including regulatory inquiries or litigation increased costs and expenses reputational damage lost revenue and fines or penalties

abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future similarly there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like abbott any significant breach attack or other disruption involving abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s business

abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested

promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbott’s existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry or regulatory standards or competitors’ innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or technologies or new indications or uses for existing products may cause abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete causing abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer

the manufacture of many of abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbott’s business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product those products may have to be discarded if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred any of these events could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other lots batches or products to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and profitability

abbott has significant indebtedness which could adversely affect its business including decreasing its business flexibility 

as of december 31 2020 abbotts consolidated indebtedness was approximately 187 billion this consolidated indebtedness could have the effect among other things of reducing abbotts flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes

further abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes abbotts ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors abbotts financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond abbotts control consequently abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to abbott or at all which could adversely impact abbotts ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition

additionally further borrowing could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit ratings abbotts credit ratings reflect each credit rating agencys then opinion of abbotts financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations adverse changes in abbotts credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities and may limit financing options including access to the unsecured borrowing market abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility

legal and regulatory risks 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug medical device or diagnostic product can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts many of abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbott’s products and criminal prosecution

these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbott’s business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbott’s products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while abbott or abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues profitability and financial condition

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbott’s industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs in the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues profitability and financial condition

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbott’s business 

both in the us and internationally government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs make adverse decisions relating to abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement or make changes to patient access to health care all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of abbott’s products or the prices that abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them

further in the us a number of the provisions of the affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 address access to health care products and services these provisions may be modified expanded repealed or otherwise invalidated in whole or in part future rulemaking could affect rebates prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or required reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law

for additional information concerning health care regulation see the discussion in “regulation” under item 1 “business”

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbott’s future revenues and operating income 

many of abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbott’s businesses could suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbott’s intellectual property rights abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced any material litigation regarding abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “legal proceedings”

significant safety concerns could arise for abbott’s products which could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbott’s products

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits safety alerts or product recalls and other allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbott’s business and reputation and on abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s profitability and financial condition

economic and industry risks 

abbott is subject to risks related to public health crises such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the covid19 pandemic 

as a global healthcare company public health crises such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact abbotts operations health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause significant reductions in demand for routine diagnostic testing and medical device procedures or increased difficulty in serving customers disrupt manufacturing and supply chains and negatively affect our operations as well as the operations of our suppliers distributors and other thirdparty partners furthermore such widespread outbreaks may impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

with regard to the covid19 pandemic the fda issued emergency use authorizations euas for several covid19 related products in 2020 including abbott diagnostic tests euas are authorized for the duration of the covid19 public health emergency unless sooner terminated or revoked abbott is actively pursuing the fda’s customary regulatory approval process for these diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in “ abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes ” in “legal and regulatory risks” under “item 1a risk factors” 

due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current covid19 pandemic the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will have a material effect on abbott’s business financial condition or results of operations is uncertain a more detailed discussion on the impact of the covid19 pandemic on abbott’s business is contained in the “financial review” section in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “regulation” to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced

competitors’ intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbott’s future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s profitability and financial condition

new products and technological advances by abbott’s competitors may negatively affect abbott’s results of operations 

abbott’s products face intense competition from competitive products competitors’ products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbott’s products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products

fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and abbott’s ability to realize projected sales and earnings 

although abbott’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars a significant portion of abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies sales outside of the united states in 2020 made up approximately 62 percent of abbott’s net sales abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the us dollar against other currencies fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of abbott’s assets and liabilities as well as its cash flows some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls while abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks

information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on abbott’s financial results is contained in the “financial review — results of operations” section in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report a discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in abbott’s 2020 form 10k information on abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this report

deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect abbott’s results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs including health care deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt including credit downgrades could increase abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems

the international nature of abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally sales outside of the united states in 2020 made up approximately 62 percent of abbott’s net sales additional risks associated with abbott’s international operations include



 

events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and profitability

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbott’s future profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbott’s profitability and its financial condition including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

financial review

abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs abbott’s primary products are medical devices diagnostic testing products nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals sales in international markets comprise approximately 62 percent of consolidated net sales

in 2020 the coronavirus covid19 pandemic affected abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways as is further described below some businesses have performed at the levels required to successfully meet new demands others have faced challenges and still others have been relatively less impacted by the pandemic 

abbott’s diagnostics business experienced the most significant change in sales from 2019 to 2020 as sales from new tests and other related products to detect covid19 more than outweighed the negative impact of covid19 on routine diagnostic testing volumes abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch the following new diagnostic tests for covid19 in 2020 

 

in 2020 abbott’s covid19 testing related sales totaled approximately 3884 billion led by sales related to abbott’s binaxnow panbio and id now rapid testing platforms

in addition to negatively impacting routine core diagnostic testing volumes the pandemic negatively affected the number of cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures performed by health care providers globally thereby reducing the demand for abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices and routine diagnostic tests in 2020 the decrease began in february in china as that country implemented quarantine restrictions and postponed nonemergency health care activities the negative impact on cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures and routine diagnostic tests expanded to other countries and geographic regions as covid19 spread geographically in the first half of 2020 and health care systems in these countries shifted their focus to fighting covid19

the extent of the impact and the timing of a recovery in the number of procedures and routine testing in a particular country or geographic region depended upon the progression of covid19 cases in the country or region the recovery in procedures and routine testing volumes in china began in march in other parts of the world such as the us and europe volumes improved across abbott’s hospitalbased businesses as the second quarter progressed and the improvement continued in the third quarter however in the fourth quarter the improving trends in the demand for procedures and routine testing flattened or were negatively impacted depending upon the business and the region as many countries experienced an increase in the number of covid19 cases and hospitalizations

abbott’s branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as covid19 spread across emerging market countries in the second and third quarters of 2020 abbott’s nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic as is further discussed below

abbott is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the pandemic due to the critical nature of its products and services abbott was generally exempt from governmental orders issued during the first quarter of 2020 in the us and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations the majority of its officebased work was conducted remotely during the period of such governmental orders and the company implemented strict travel restrictions as some governmental orders were lifted in may and june 2020 abbott entered a new phase in its operations whereby some officebased employees started working at abbott’s offices on a rotational basis as various governmental orders and guidelines were modified in the fourth quarter to put in place new restrictions abbott continued to ensure that its guidance was aligned with such restrictions abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees

due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current covid19 pandemic the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will have a material effect on its business financial condition or results of operations is uncertain

while abbott’s 2020 sales were most significantly affected by the covid19 pandemic the increase in total sales over the last three years also reflects volume growth due to the introduction of new products across various businesses as well as higher sales of various existing products sales in emerging markets which represent approximately 37 percent of total company sales increased 20 percent in 2020 and 82 percent in 2019 excluding the impact of foreign exchange emerging markets include all countries except the united states western europe japan canada australia and new zealand

over the last three years abbott’s operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 119 percent in 2018 to 142 percent in 2019 and 155 percent in 2020 the increase in 2020 reflects the sales volume increases in the rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses partially offset by lower medical devices sales due to the impact of the pandemic and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange in addition a reduction in the costs associated with business acquisitions and restructuring activities drove an improvement in operating margins from 2018 to 2020 in 2019 the increase in abbott’s operating margin also reflects margin improvement in various businesses and lower intangible amortization expense compared to 2018

with respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years sales in the medical devices segment excluding the impact of foreign exchange decreased 38 percent in 2020 and increased 105 percent in 2019 the sales decrease in 2020 was driven by abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due primarily to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the covid19 pandemic these decreases were partially offset by doubledigit growth in diabetes care the sales increase in 2019 was driven primarily by higher diabetes care structural heart electrophysiology and heart failure sales

in 2020 operating earnings for the medical devices segment decreased 194 percent the operating margin profile decreased from 308 percent of sales in 2019 to 258 percent in 2020 primarily due to lower sales and manufacturing volumes as a result of the pandemic and pricing pressures on drug eluting stents des as a result of market competition in the us and other major markets 

in 2020 key product approvals in the medical devices segment included

 

in abbott’s worldwide diagnostics business sales increased 406 percent in 2020 and 59 percent in 2019 excluding the impact of foreign exchange as was discussed above sales growth in 2020 was driven by demand for abbotts portfolio of covid19 diagnostics tests across its rapid and labbased platforms partially offset by lower volumes of routine laboratory testing due to the pandemic growth in 2019 reflected continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the us and internationally the 2019 growth included the continued adoption by customers of alinity which is abbott’s integrated family of nextgeneration diagnostic systems and solutions that are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results

abbott has regulatory approvals in the us europe china and other markets for the “alinity c” and “alinity i” instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the “alinity h” instrument for hematology in europe and japan abbott has also obtained regulatory approvals in the us and europe for the “alinity s” blood screening and “alinity m” molecular instruments and several testing assays

in 2020 operating earnings for the diagnostics segment increased 948 percent the operating margin profile increased from 249 percent of sales in 2018 to 345 percent in 2020 primarily due to higher sales in 2020 in rapid diagnostics and molecular diagnostics partially offset by lower volumes of routine testing in core laboratory

in abbott’s worldwide nutritional products business sales over the last three years were positively impacted by numerous new product introductions including the rollouts of human milk oligosaccharide or hmo in infant formula and of highprotein ensure ®  that leveraged abbott’s strong brands sales were also positively affected by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets excluding the impact of foreign exchange total adult nutrition sales increased 103 percent in 2020 and 66 percent in 2019 led by the continued growth of ensure abbott’s marketleading complete and balanced nutrition brand and glucerna ®  abbott’s marketleading diabetesspecific nutrition brand across several countries the 2019 sales growth was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the discontinuation of a noncore product line in the us excluding the impact of foreign exchange total pediatric nutrition sales increased 03 percent in 2020 and 34 percent in 2019 driven by the pediasure ® and pedialyte ® brands in the us as well as infant and toddler product growth across several markets in asia and latin america partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in greater china the 2020 increase was also driven by higher similac ® sales in the us

the established pharmaceutical products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets excluding the impact of foreign exchange established pharmaceutical sales increased 19 percent in 2020 and 73 percent in 2019 the sales increases in 2020 and 2019 reflect higher sales in several geographies including india china brazil and russia operating margins decreased from 202 percent of sales in 2018 to 185 percent in 2020 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange product mix and lower gross margins

critical accounting policies

sales rebates — in 2020 approximately 41 percent of abbott’s consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances in 2020 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care businesses abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 amounted to approximately 33 billion 31 billion and 30 billion respectively or 201 percent 191 percent and 190 percent of gross sales respectively based on gross sales of approximately 166 billion 163 billion and 160 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 166 million in 2020 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 207 million 169 million and 175 million for cash discounts in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively and 232 million 192 million and 191 million for returns in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbott’s historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals in the wic business estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott holds the wic contract the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price is reliably determinable rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the us department of agriculture usda and the states submitting rebate claims the usda which administers the wic program has been making its data available for many years management also estimates the states processing lag time based on sales and claims data inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially management has access to several large customers inventory management data which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel at december 31 2020 abbott had wic business in 27 states

historically adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items is often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for years can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2020 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss were net losses of 46 billion for abbott’s defined benefit plans and net losses of 419 million for abbott’s medical and dental plans actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott’s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december 31 2020 goodwill amounted to 237 billion and net intangibles amounted to 148 billion amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to 21 billion in 2020 19 billion in 2019 and 22 billion in 2018 there was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2020 2019 and 2018

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 450 “contingencies” under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 90 million to 120 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 105 million have been recorded at december 31 2020 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 “contingencies”

in the diagnostics segment the sales increase in 2019 was driven by abovemarket growth in core laboratory in the us and internationally where abbott achieved continued adoption of its alinity family of diagnostic instruments the 63 percent decrease in 2019 molecular sales excluding the effect of foreign exchange reflects the negative impact of lower nongovernmental organization purchases in africa in rapid diagnostics sales growth in 2019 in various areas including infectious disease testing in developed markets and cardiometabolic testing was mostly offset by lower than expected infectious disease testing sales in africa

excluding the effect of foreign exchange total medical devices sales decreased 38 percent and increased 105 percent in 2020 and 2019 respectively in 2020 doubledigit growth in diabetes care was more than offset by decreases in abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due to the impact of covid19 and lower vascular sales in china in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of a new national tender program the 2019 sales increase was driven by doubledigit growth in diabetes care structural heart electrophysiology and heart failure

the 2020 and 2019 growth in diabetes care revenue was driven by continued growth of freestyle libre abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system internationally and in the us in 2020 freestyle libre sales totaled 2635 billion which reflected a 426 percent increase over 2019 excluding the effect of foreign exchange freestyle libre sales in 2019 were 1842 billion which reflected a 698 percent increase excluding the effect of foreign exchange over 2018 when sales totaled 1128 billion

research and development programs

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical devices diagnostic and nutritional products in development

research and development process 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment’s existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity

depending upon the product the phases of development may include

 

the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include

 

the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fda’s premarket approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a biological license application bla

in the european union eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which has been governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to declare conformity to the directive other products only require a selfcertification process in the second quarter of 2017 the eu adopted the new in vitro diagnostic regulation ivdr which replaces the existing directive in the eu for in vitro diagnostic products the ivdr will apply after a fiveyear transition period and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products

in the medical devices segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation selection and qualification of a product design completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product’s safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us medical devices are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbott’s medical device products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process

in the eu medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which has been governed by the european medical device directive and the active implantable medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive in the second quarter of 2017 the eu adopted the new medical devices regulation mdr which replaces the existing directives in the eu for medical devices and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products while the mdr was previously adopted to apply after a three year transition period in 2020 the european parliament postponed the date of application by one year

some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions

after approval and commercial launch of some medical devices postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants and adults or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a product’s efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fda’s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutritional products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products

areas of focus

in 2021 and beyond abbott’s significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following

established pharmaceuticals — abbott focuses on building countryspecific portfolios made up of highquality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets over the next several years abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new offpatent and differentiated medicines in addition abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as creon™ duphaston™ duphalac™ and influvac™ depending on the product the activities focus on development of new data markets formulations delivery systems or indications one example includes the launch of abbott’s quadrivalent influenza vaccination influvac® tetra in 12 markets and an expanded indication in 16 markets to cover children adolescents and young adults from 3 to 17 years old

medical devices — abbott’s research and development programs focus on

 

nutritionals — abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas gastro intestinalimmunity health brain health mobility and metabolism and user experience platforms numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development including clinical outcome testing and are expected to be launched over the coming years

core laboratory diagnostics — abbott continues to commercialize its nextgeneration blood screening immunoassay clinical chemistry and hematology systems along with assays including a focus on unmet medical need in various areas including infectious disease cardiac care metabolics and oncology as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories

molecular diagnostics — several new molecular in vitro diagnostic ivd tests are in various stages of development and launch

rapid diagnostics — abbott’s research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease cardiometabolic disease and toxicology

in addition the diagnostics divisions are pursuing the fda’s customary regulatory process for various covid19 tests for which an eua was obtained in 2020

given the diversity of abbott’s business its intention to remain a broadbased health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbott’s total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbott’s overall market position there were no delays in abbott’s 2020 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbott’s ability to successfully finish each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates and such spending is expected to approximate 70 percent of total abbott sales in 2021 abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period

goodwill

at december 31 2020 goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled 237 billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value

financial condition

cash flow

net cash from operating activities amounted to 79 billion 61 billion and 63 billion in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to the favorable cash flow impact of higher segment operating earnings lower payments related to interest integration expenses and restructuring actions and the proceeds from a litigation settlement partially offset by an increased investment in working capital and higher income tax payments the decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2019 was primarily due to an increased investment in working capital timing of pension contributions relative to 2018 and higher income tax payments partially offset by the favorable cash flow impact of improved segment operating earnings and lower interest and acquisitionrelated expenses

while a significant portion of abbott’s cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 are reinvested in foreign subsidiaries abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources due to the enactment of the tcja if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds

abbott funded 400 million in 2020 382 million in 2019 and 114 million in 2018 to defined benefit pension plans abbott expects pension funding of approximately 410 million in 2021 for its pension plans abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbott’s capital expenditures and cash dividends

working capital

working capital was 85 billion at december 31 2020 and 48 billion at december 31 2019 the increase was due in large part to the higher level of cash and cash equivalents which was due primarily to the increase in cash generated from operating activities and the repayment of the current portion of long term debt after the issuance of new long term notes in 2020 working capital also increased due to the higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable associated with the growth of the business

abbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset abbott considers various factors in establishing monitoring and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts including the aging of the accounts and aging trends the historical level of chargeoffs and specific exposures related to particular customers abbott also monitors other risk factors and forwardlooking information such as country risk when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances

interest rate sensitive financial instruments

at december 31 2020 and 2019 abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 29 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged abbott does not use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities the fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2020 and 2019 amounted to 228 billion and 208 billion respectively average interest rates of 33 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 with maturities through 2046 at december 31 2020 and 2019 the fair value of current and longterm investment securities amounted to approximately 11 billion and 12 billion respectively a hypothetical 100basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows income or fair values

abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and thirdparty trade payables and receivables the contracts are markedtomarket and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed at december 31 2020 and 2019 abbott held 110 billion and 91 billion respectively of such contracts which mature in the next 13 months

in november 2019 abbott borrowed ¥598 billion under a 5year term loan and designated the yendenominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the proceeds equated to approximately 550 million the value of this longterm debt was approximately 577 million and 546 million as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively the change in the value of the debt which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax

environmental matters

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbott’s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2019 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2020

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbott’s financial position cash flows or results of operations

employees

abbott employed approximately 107000 people as of december 31 2019

regulation

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbott’s products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices in addition abbott’s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation including registration certification and licensure by federal state and local agencies such as the centers for medicare  medicaid services the drug enforcement administration the substance abuse and mental health services administration and their respective foreign counterparts certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance quality control and personnel standards and undergo inspections

abbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries these may require local investment restrict abbott’s investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products

abbott’s laboratory facilities and home monitoring services which provide services related products and medical devices to consumers are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to thirdparty payors in the united states medicare medicaid and other thirdparty payors may from time to time conduct inquiries claims audits investigations and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbott’s business among other effects health care regulations and significant changes thereto such as the introduction of the medical device regulation and the in vitro diagnostic medical device regulation in the european union substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in developing obtaining and maintaining approval to market and marketing newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale suspension or revocation of billing privileges and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties similarly compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions including suspension revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s certification which is necessary to conduct business as well as significant fines or criminal penalties

abbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbott’s products for the foreseeable future in the united states the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices diagnostics supplies and other products as well as the procedures in which these products may be used the government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg 

payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time for example medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies additionally the protecting access to medicare act establishes a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests which became effective on january 1 2018

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act imposed an excise tax on abbott and other medical device manufacturers and importers the excise tax was suspended from january 1 2016 to december 31 2019 and was repealed as of january 1 2020 by the further consolidated appropriations act of 2020

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which requires manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare  medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure in october 2018 the substance use disorder prevention that promotes opioid recovery and treatment for patients and communities act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required beginning with reports filed in 2022 similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties

policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems in the united states this could include potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the affordable care act

the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information including patient health information and financial information is increasing for example the european union various other countries and various us states eg california have enacted stricter data protection laws that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance similarly the us department of health and human services has issued rules governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information and the fda has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices in addition certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended and abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area

governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbott’s nutritional products business in the united states for example under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program

abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture quality assurance requirements marketing authorization processes postmarket surveillance requirements availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above

 item 1a risk factors

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbott’s securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbott’s actual results abbott’s business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbott’s credit rating result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and decrease liquidity

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “regulation” to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug medical device or diagnostic product can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts many of abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbott’s products and criminal prosecution

these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbott’s business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbott’s products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while abbott or abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues profitability and financial condition

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbott’s industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs in the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues profitability and financial condition

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbott’s business 

both in the us and internationally government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs make adverse decisions relating to our products’ coverage or reimbursement or make changes to patient access to health care all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of abbott’s products or the prices that abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them

further in the us a number of the provisions of the us patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 address access to health care products and services these provisions may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated in whole or in part future rulemaking could affect rebates prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or required reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law

for additional information concerning health care regulation see the discussion in “regulation” under item 1 “business”

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks in addition third party hacking attempts may cause abbott’s information technology systems and related products protected data or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen a significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences including increased costs and expenses problems with product functionality damage to customer relations lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties

abbott also collects manages and processes protected personal data including protected health information in connection with certain medical products and service offerings abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders for additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation see the discussion in “regulation” under item 1 “business” a breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences including regulatory inquiries or litigation increased costs and expenses reputational damage lost revenue and fines or penalties

abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future any significant attack or other disruption on abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s business

abbott has significant indebtedness which could adversely affect its business including decreasing its business flexibility 

as of december 31 2019 abbotts consolidated indebtedness was approximately 18 billion this consolidated indebtedness could have the effect among other things of reducing abbotts flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes

further abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes abbotts ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors abbotts financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond abbotts control consequently abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to abbott or at all which could adversely impact abbotts ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition

additionally further borrowing could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit ratings abbotts credit ratings reflect each credit rating agencys then opinion of abbotts financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations adverse changes in abbotts credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities and may limit financing options including access to the unsecured borrowing market abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbott’s future revenues and operating income 

many of abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbott’s businesses could suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbott’s intellectual property rights abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced any material litigation regarding abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “legal proceedings”

competitors’ intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbott’s future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s profitability and financial condition

abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested

promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbott’s existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry or regulatory standards or competitors’ innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under 

development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or technologies or new indications or uses for existing products may cause abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete causing abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer

new products and technological advances by abbott’s competitors may negatively affect abbott’s results of operations 

abbott’s products face intense competition from its competitors’ products competitors’ products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbott’s products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products

the manufacture of many of abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbott’s business could suffer

the manufacture of many of abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product those products may have to be discarded if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred any of these events could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other lots batches or products to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and profitability

significant safety concerns could arise for abbott’s products which could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbott’s products

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits safety alerts or product recalls and other allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbott’s business and reputation and on abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s profitability and financial condition

fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and abbott’s ability to realize projected sales and earnings 

although abbott’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars a significant portion of abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies sales outside of the united states in 2019 made up approximately 64 percent of abbott’s net sales abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the us dollar against other currencies fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of abbott’s assets and liabilities as well as its cash flows some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls while abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks

information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on abbott’s financial results is contained in the “financial review — results of operations” section in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report a discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in abbott’s 2019 form 10k information on abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this report

deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect abbott’s results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs including health care deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt including credit downgrades could increase abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems

the international nature of abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally sales outside of the united states in 2019 made up approximately 64 percent of abbott’s net sales additional risks associated with abbott’s international operations include

 

events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and profitability

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbott’s future profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbott’s profitability and its financial condition including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

financial review

abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs abbott’s primary products are medical devices diagnostic testing products nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals sales in international markets comprise approximately 64 percent of consolidated net sales

over the last several years abbott proactively shaped the company with the strategic intent to deliver sustainable growth in all of its businesses significant steps over the last three years included

 

the increase in total sales over the last three years reflects both volume growth across abbott’s businesses and the 2017 acquisitions of st jude medical and alere volume growth reflects the introduction of new products as well as higher sales of existing products sales in emerging markets which represent approximately 40 percent of total company sales increased 82 percent in 2019 and 123 percent in 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange emerging markets include all countries except the united states western europe japan canada australia and new zealand

over the last three years abbott’s operating margin was positively impacted by margin improvements in various businesses including established pharmaceutical products diabetes care rapid diagnostics and structural heart a reduction in the costs associated with the recent business acquisitions also drove the improvement in operating margins from 2017 to 2019 in 2019 abbott’s operating margin increased by approximately 2 percentage points primarily due to lower intangible amortization expense and lower business integration and restructuring costs compared to 2018 in 2018 abbott’s operating margin increased by approximately 6 percentage points primarily due to operating margin improvement in various businesses and lower inventory stepup amortization and integration costs associated with the acquisitions

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 the results of the diabetes care business which had previously been included in the nonreportable segment category were aggregated with the results of the businesses in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation segment to comprise the medical devices reportable segment historic periods have been adjusted to reflect this change 

excluding the impact of foreign exchange sales in the medical devices segment increased 105 percent in 2019 and 90 percent in 2018 the sales increase in 2019 was driven primarily by higher diabetes care structural heart electrophysiology and heart failure sales the sales increase in 2018 was driven primarily by higher diabetes care structural heart electrophysiology and neuromodulation sales

in 2019 operating earnings for this segment increased 77 percent the operating margin profile increased from 292 percent of sales in 2017 to 308 percent in 2019 primarily due to sales volume growth and various cost improvement initiatives partially offset by investment spending to drive the growth of new products

critical accounting policies

sales rebates — in 2019 approximately 44 percent of abbott’s consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances in 2019 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care businesses abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately 31 billion 30 billion and 28 billion respectively or 191 percent 190 percent and 205 percent of gross sales respectively based on gross sales of approximately 163 billion 160 billion and 139 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 163 million in 2019 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 169 million 175 million and 166 million for cash discounts in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively and 192 million 191 million and 204 million for returns in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbott’s historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals in the wic business estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott holds the wic contract the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price is reliably determinable rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the us department of agriculture usda and the states submitting rebate claims the usda which administers the wic program has been making its data available for many years management also estimates the states processing lag time based on sales and claims data inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially management has access to several large customers inventory management data which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel at december 31 2019 abbott had wic business in 26 states

historically adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items is often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former alere consolidated group which are settled through 2015 and the former st jude medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013 undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for years can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2019 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbott’s defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 41 billion and 434 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 15 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott’s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december 31 2019 goodwill amounted to 232 billion and net intangibles amounted to 170 billion amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to 19 billion in 2019 22 billion in 2018 and 20 billion in 2017 there was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2019 2018 and 2017

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 450 “contingencies” under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 95 million to 130 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 110 million have been recorded at december 31 2019 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 “contingencies”

research and development programs

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical devices diagnostic and nutritional products in development

research and development process 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment’s existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity

depending upon the product the phases of development may include

 

the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include

 

the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fda’s premarket approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a biological license application bla

in the european union eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which has been governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to declare conformity to the directive other products only require a selfcertification process in the second quarter of 2017 the eu adopted the new in vitro diagnostic regulation ivdr which replaces the existing directive in the eu for in vitro diagnostic products the ivdr will apply after a fiveyear transition period and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products

in the medical devices segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation selection and qualification of a product design completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product’s safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us medical devices are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbott’s medical device products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process

in the eu medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which has been governed by the european medical device directive and the active implantable medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive in the second quarter of 2017 the eu adopted the new medical devices regulation mdr which replaces the existing directives in the eu for medical devices the mdr will apply after a three to fiveyear depending on product classification transition period and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products

some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions

after approval and commercial launch of some medical devices postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants and adults or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a product’s efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fda’s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutritional products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products

areas of focus

in 2020 and beyond abbott’s significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following

established pharmaceuticals — abbott focuses on building countryspecific portfolios made up of highquality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets over the next several years abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new offpatent and differentiated medicines in addition abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as creon™ duphaston™ duphalac™ and influvac™ depending on the product the activities focus on development of new data markets formulations delivery systems or indications

medical devices — abbott’s research and development programs focus on

 

core laboratory diagnostics — abbott continues to commercialize its nextgeneration blood screening immunoassay clinical chemistry and hematology systems along with assays including a focus on unmet medical need in various areas including infectious disease cardiac care metabolics and oncology as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories

rapid diagnostics — abbott’s research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for cardiometabolic disease infectious disease and toxicology

nutritionals — abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas gastro intestinalimmunity health brain health mobility and metabolism and user experience platforms numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development including clinical outcome testing and are expected to be launched over the coming years

given the diversity of abbott’s business its intention to remain a broadbased healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbott’s total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbott’s overall market position there were no delays in abbott’s 2019 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbott’s ability to successfully finish each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates and such spending is expected to approximate 70 percent of total abbott sales in 2020 abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period

financial condition

cash flow

net cash from operating activities amounted to 61 billion 63 billion and 56 billion in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2019 was primarily due to an increased investment in working capital timing of pension contributions relative to 2018 and higher income tax payments partially offset by the favorable cash flow impact of improved segment operating earnings and lower interest and acquisitionrelated expenses the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2018 was primarily due to higher segment operating earnings continued improvements in working capital management timing of pension contributions and lower acquisitionrelated expenses the income tax component of cash from operating activities in 2018 includes the noncash impact of the 120 million adjustment to the transition tax associated with the tcja the income tax component of operating cash flow in 2017 includes the noncash impact of 146 billion of net tax expense related to the estimated impact of the tcja

while a significant portion of abbott’s cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019 are reinvested in foreign subsidiaries abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources due to the enactment of the tcja if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds

abbott funded 382 million in 2019 114 million in 2018 and 645 million in 2017 to defined benefit pension plans abbott expects pension funding of approximately 387 million in 2020 for its pension plans abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbott’s capital expenditures and cash dividends

interest rate sensitive financial instruments

at december 31 2019 and 2018 abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 29 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged abbott does not use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities the fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2019 and 2018 amounted to 208 billion and 199 billion respectively average interest rates of 33 and 35 as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively with maturities through 2046 at december 31 2019 and 2018 the fair value of current and longterm investment securities amounted to approximately 12 billion and 11 billion respectively a hypothetical 100basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows income or fair values a 100basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in rates

the established pharmaceutical products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building a strong brand with key stakeholders including consumers pharmacists physicians and other healthcare providers government agencies are also important customers 

competition in the established pharmaceutical products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies in addition the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures

competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers competitive factors include consumer advertising formulation packaging scientific innovation price retail distribution and availability of product forms a significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations the introduction of new products by competitors changes in medical practices and procedures and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence in addition private label and local manufacturers products may increase competitive pressure

information with respect to abbotts business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to abbotts operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and around the world there have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies 

patents trademarks and licenses 

abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for abbotts products in the united states 

and countries of interest to abbott abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the narrative description of business on pages 1 through 4 these and various patents which expire during the period 2019 to 2039 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbotts business abbott believes that no single patent license or trademark is material in relation to abbotts business as a whole 

seasonal aspects customers backlog and renegotiation 

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbotts business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott orders for abbotts products are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbotts business no material portion of abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2018 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2019 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 103000 people as of december 31 2018 

regulation 

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbotts products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices in addition abbotts clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation including registration certification and licensure by federal state and local agencies such as the centers for medicare  medicaid services the drug enforcement administration the substance abuse and mental health services administration and their respective foreign counterparts certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance quality control and personnel standards and undergo inspections 

abbotts international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries these may require local investment restrict abbotts investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products 

abbotts home monitoring services and related products and laboratories that provide abbott and thirdparty medical devices to consumers in the united states are subject to additional federal state and local laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to thirdparty payors medicare medicaid and other thirdparty payors may from time to time conduct inquiries claims audits investigations and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria 

abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback antiselfreferral and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbotts business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale suspension or revocation of billing privileges and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties similarly compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions including suspension revocation or limitation of a laboratorys certification which is necessary to conduct business as well as significant fines or criminal penalties 

abbotts business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbotts products for the foreseeable future 

in the united states the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices diagnostics supplies and other products as well as the procedures in which these products may be used the government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products other payment methodology changes have been proposed and 

implemented from time to time for example medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies additionally the protecting access to medicare act establishes a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests which became effective on january 1 2018 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act imposed an excise tax on abbott and other medical device manufacturers and importers the excise tax was subsequently suspended from january 1 2016 through december 31 2017 as part of the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 in january 2018 the excise tax was suspended for an additional two years 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which requires manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare  medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure in october 2018 the substance use disorder prevention that promotes opioid recovery and treatment for patients and communities act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required beginning with reports filed in 2022 similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

policy changes including potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the affordable care act or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to the health care system 

the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information including patient health information and financial information is increasing for example the european union has enacted stricter data protection laws which took effect in 2018 that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance similarly the us department of health and human services has issued rules governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information and the us food and drug administration has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices in addition certain countries have issued or are considering data localization laws which limit companies ability to transfer protected data across country borders failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended and abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area 

governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbotts nutritional products business in the united states for example under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program 

abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the marketing manufacture availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbotts securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbotts actual results abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and decrease liquidity 

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned regulation to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug medical device or diagnostic product can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts many of abbotts facilities and procedures and those of abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbotts products and criminal prosecution 

these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbotts business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while abbott or abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbotts industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs in the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbotts business 

both in the us and internationally government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs make adverse decisions relating to our products coverage or reimbursement or make changes to patient access to health care all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of abbotts products or the prices that abbotts customers are willing to pay for them 

further in the us a number of the provisions of the us patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 address access to health care products and services and establish certain fees for the medical device industry these provisions may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated in whole or in part future rulemaking could affect rebates prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or required reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law 

for additional information concerning health care regulation see the discussion in regulation under item 1 business 

abbott has incurred and assumed significant indebtedness which has increased consolidated interest expense and could decrease business flexibility 

abbott incurred and assumed significant indebtedness in connection with the 2017 acquisitions of st jude medical and alere as of december 31 2018 abbotts consolidated indebtedness was approximately 196 billion this consolidated indebtedness increased abbotts consolidated interest expense and could have the effect among other things of reducing abbotts flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

further abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes abbotts ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors abbotts financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond abbotts control 

consequently abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to abbott or at all which could adversely impact abbotts ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition 

additionally further borrowing could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating abbotts credit ratings reflect each credit rating agencys then opinion of abbotts financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations adverse changes in abbotts credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities and may limit financing options including access to the unsecured borrowing market abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility 

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on abbotts results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks in addition third party hacking attempts may cause abbotts information technology systems and related products protected data or proprietary information to be compromised a significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences including increased costs and expenses problems with product functionality damage to customer relations lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties 

abbott also collects manages and processes protected personal data including protected health information in connection with certain medical products and service offerings for additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation see the discussion in regulation under item 1 business a breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences including regulatory inquiries or litigation increased costs and expenses reputational damage lost revenue and fines or penalties 

abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future any significant attack or other disruption on abbotts systems or products could have a material adverse effect on abbotts business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbotts future revenues and operating income 

many of abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbotts intellectual property have come from other companies governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbotts businesses could suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbotts intellectual property rights abbotts future revenues and operating income could be reduced any material litigation regarding abbotts patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned legal proceedings 

competitors intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbotts revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or technologies or new indications or uses for existing products may cause abbotts products or technologies to become obsolete causing abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer 

new products and technological advances by abbotts competitors may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

abbotts products face intense competition from its competitors products competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbotts products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbotts business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product those products may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause 

similar losses with respect to other lots batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

significant safety concerns could arise for abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbotts products 

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits safety alerts or product recalls and other allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbotts business and reputation and on abbotts ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and abbotts ability to realize projected sales and earnings 

although abbotts financial statements are denominated in us dollars a significant portion of abbotts revenues and costs are realized in other currencies sales outside of the united states in 2018 made up approximately 65 percent of abbotts net sales abbotts profitability is affected by movement of the us dollar against other currencies fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of abbotts assets and liabilities as well as its cash flows some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls while abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks 

information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on abbotts financial results is contained in the financial review — results of operations section in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report a discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in abbotts 2018 form 10k information on abbotts hedging arrangements is contained in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs including health care deterioration in the quality of 

sovereign debt including credit downgrades could increase abbotts collection risk where a significant amount of abbotts receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where abbotts customers depend on payment by government health care systems 

the international nature of abbotts business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbotts business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally sales outside of the united states in 2018 made up approximately 65 percent of abbotts net sales additional risks associated with abbotts international operations include 

• differing local product preferences and product requirements • trade protection measures including tariffs import or export licensing requirements and changes to international trade agreements • difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations • differing labor regulations • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws • political and economic instability including sovereign debt issues • restrictions on local currency conversion andor cash extraction • price controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action • inflation recession and fluctuations in interest rates • diminished protection of intellectual property and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anticorruption antibribery and other similar laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbotts profitability and its financial condition including 

• changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements product marketing application standards product labeling source and use laws and environmental laws • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value particularly for pensions retiree health care stock compensation intangibles goodwill and contingent consideration and for contingent liabilities such as litigation the absence of a recorded amount or an amount recorded at the minimum compared to the actual amount • changes in the rate of inflation including the cost of raw materials commodities and supplies interest rates market value of abbotts equity investments and the performance of investments held by abbott or abbotts employee benefit trusts • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to abbott or abbotts employee benefit trusts 14 

• changes in business economic and political conditions including war political instability terrorist attacks the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action global climate extreme weather and natural disasters widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events labor disputes strikes slowdowns or other forms of labor or union activity and pressure from thirdparty interest groups • changes in abbotts business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies changing product mix changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the us and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future • changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor retailer or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions pricing seasonality or other factors or other problems with licensors suppliers distributors and business partners and • legal difficulties any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations and adverse litigation decisions cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial review 

abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbotts products under a contract most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs abbotts primary products are cardiovascular and neuromodulation products diagnostic testing products nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals sales in international markets comprise approximately 65 percent of consolidated net sales 

over the last several years abbott proactively shaped the company with the strategic intent to deliver sustainable growth in all of its businesses significant steps over the last three years included 

• in january 2017 abbott acquired st jude medical inc st jude medical a global medical device manufacturer for approximately 236 billion including approximately 136 billion in cash and approximately 10 billion in abbott common shares based on abbotts closing stock price on the acquisition date as part of the acquisition abbott assumed repaid or refinanced approximately 59 billion of st jude medicals debt the acquisition provided expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the companys effort to develop a strong diverse portfolio the combined business competes in nearly every area of the 30 billion global cardiovascular device market as well as in neuromodulation which treats chronic pain and movement disorders • in october 2017 abbott acquired alere inc alere a diagnostic device and service provider for 5100 per common share in cash which equated to a purchase price of approximately 45 billion as part of the acquisition abbott also tendered for aleres preferred shares for a total value of approximately 07 billion and assumed and subsequently repaid approximately 30 billion of aleres debt the acquisition established abbott as a leader in point of care testing expanded abbotts global diagnostics presence and provided access to new products channels and geographies • in february 2017 abbott completed the sale of abbott medical optics amo its vision care business to johnson  johnson for 4325 billion in cash and recognized an aftertax gain of 728 million the operating results of amo were included in earnings from continuing operations up to the date of sale as the business did not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations the sales increase over the last three years reflects both the 2017 acquisitions of st jude medical and alere and volume growth across abbotts businesses most notably in the established pharmaceuticals diabetes care and diagnostics businesses volume growth reflects the introduction of new products as well as higher sales of existing products in 2017 the acquisitions of st jude medical and alere partially offset by the sale of amo contributed 265 percentage points of abbotts total sales growth versus 2016 sales in emerging markets which represent approximately 40 percent of total company sales increased 123 percent in 2018 and 139 percent in 2017 excluding the impact of foreign exchange emerging markets include all countries except the united states western europe japan canada australia and new zealand 

over the last three years abbotts operating margin was positively impacted by margin improvements across various businesses including established pharmaceuticals core laboratory and diabetes care partially offset by higher amortization and other costs associated with the acquisitions in 2018 abbotts operating margin increased by approximately 6 percentage points primarily due to operating margin improvement in various businesses and lower inventory stepup amortization and integration costs associated with the acquisitions partially offset by higher intangible amortization in 2017 abbotts 

operating margin decreased by approximately 9 percentage points primarily due to costs associated with the acquisitions including higher intangible amortization expense inventory stepup amortization and integration costs partially offset by operating margin improvement in various businesses 

since the beginning of the first quarter of 2017 the results of abbotts cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment include abbotts historical vascular products segment and st jude medical from the date of acquisition excluding the impact of foreign exchange sales in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment increased 49 percent in 2018 and 2074 percent in 2017 the sales increase in 2018 was driven primarily by higher structural heart electrophysiology and neuromodulation sales the sales increase in 2017 was driven by the acquisition of st jude medical excluding the impact of the acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange sales in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment were essentially unchanged in 2017 versus the prior year in 2017 higher structural heart and endovascular sales were offset by lower coronary stent sales and the comparison impact from the favorable 2016 resolution of a thirdparty royalty agreement in abbotts vascular business 

in 2018 operating earnings for this segment increased 99 percent the operating margin profile declined from 358 percent of sales in 2016 to 317 percent in 2018 primarily due to the mix of business resulting from the acquisition of st jude medical and ongoing pricing pressures in the coronary business cost improvement initiatives contributed to an improvement in the operating margin profile from 305 percent in 2017 to 317 percent in 2018 

in 2018 the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment received approval or clearance from the us food and drug administration fda for the following products 

• the advisor® hd grid mapping catheter sensor enabled™ which creates highly detailed maps of the heart and expands abbotts electrophysiology product portfolio • the nextgeneration version of abbotts leading mitraclip® heart valve repair device • the heartmate 3® left ventricular assist device lvad as a destination longterm use therapy and • the xience sierra® drug eluting stent system which is the next generation of its drugeluting coronary stent system the xience sierra drug eluting stent system also received national reimbursement in japan to treat people with coronary artery disease in abbotts worldwide diagnostics business sales growth over the last three years reflected the acquisition of alere in october 2017 as well as continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the us and internationally aleres results are included in abbotts diagnostic products reportable segment from the date of acquisition worldwide diagnostic sales increased 336 percent in 2018 and 167 percent in 2017 excluding the impact of foreign exchange excluding the impact of the alere acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange sales in the diagnostic products segment increased 65 percent in 2018 and 55 percent in 2017 this growth includes the continued rollout of alinity® which is abbotts integrated family of nextgeneration diagnostic systems and solutions that are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results abbott has regulatory approvals in the us europe china and other markets for the alinity c and alinity i instruments for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics respectively in 2018 abbott accelerated the launch of alinity in europe and other international markets after a broad range of assays obtained regulatory approval and were added to the test menu abbott also continued the rollout of alinity s for blood and plasma screening 

margin improvement continued to be a key focus for the diagnostics business in 2018 and 2017 while operating margins of 249 percent of sales in 2018 have remained relatively unchanged from the 248 percent of sales reported in 2016 this reflects dilution to the operating margin profit from the 

acquisition of alere and the negative impact of foreign exchange offset by the continued execution of efficiency initiatives in the manufacturing and supply chain functions 

in abbotts worldwide nutritional products business sales over the last three years were positively impacted by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets as well as by numerous new product introductions that leveraged abbotts strong brands in 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the nutritional business experienced abovemarket growth in the worldwide pediatric business driven by market leading brands similac® and pedialyte® in the us as well as growth across several markets in asia worldwide adult nutrition sales increased in 2018 led by the growth of ensure® abbotts marketleading complete and balanced nutrition brand and glucerna® abbotts marketleading diabetesspecific nutrition brand 

in 2017 the nutritionals business experienced growth in the us driven by abovemarket performance in abbotts infant and toddler brands internationally 2017 sales growth in china and india was partially offset by challenging market conditions in the infant formula market in various emerging markets with respect to the profitability of the nutritional products business manufacturing and distribution process changes as well as other cost reductions drove margin improvements across the business over the last three years although such improvements were offset by inflation on commodity costs the decrease in operating margins for this business from 241 percent of sales in 2016 to 229 percent in 2018 was primarily due to negative impact of foreign exchange 

the established pharmaceutical products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets excluding the impact of foreign exchange established pharmaceutical sales increased 70 percent in 2018 and 95 percent in 2017 the sales increase in 2018 was driven by doubledigit growth in india and china the sales increase in 2017 was primarily driven by doubledigit growth in china and various countries in latin america operating margins increased from 187 percent of sales in 2016 to 202 percent in 2018 primarily due to the continued focus on cost reduction initiatives 

in its diabetes business abbott received us fda approval for its freestyle libre® 14 day sensor making it the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available the freestyle libre system is the only continuous glucose monitoring system that does not require any user calibration 

in conjunction with the funding of the st jude medical and alere acquisitions and the assumption of st jude medicals and aleres existing debt abbotts total shortterm and longterm debt increased from approximately 90 billion at december 31 2015 to 279 billion at december 31 2017 at the beginning of 2018 abbott committed to reducing its debt levels and in 2018 abbott repaid approximately 83 billion of debt net of borrowings bringing its total debt to 196 billion 

abbott declared dividends of 116 per share in 2018 compared to 1075 per share in 2017 an increase of approximately 8 percent dividends paid totaled 1974 billion in 2018 compared to 1849 billion in 2017 the yearoveryear change in the amount of dividends paid reflects the increase in the dividend rate in december 2018 abbott increased the companys quarterly dividend by approximately 14 percent to 032 per share from 028 per share effective with the dividend paid in february 2019 

in 2019 abbott will focus on continuing to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years in its diagnostics business abbott will continue to focus on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its alinity suite of diagnostics instruments in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation business abbott will continue to focus on expanding its market position in various areas including electrophysiology heart failure and structural heart in its nutritionals business abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of several new sciencebased products in the established pharmaceuticals business abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth 

of its portfolio in emerging markets in its diabetes care business abbott will focus on driving continued market adoption of its freestyle libre continuous glucose monitoring system 

critical accounting policies 

sales rebates — in 2018 approximately 45 percent of abbotts consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances in 2018 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care segments abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 amounted to approximately 30 billion 28 billion and 25 billion respectively or 190 percent 205 percent and 229 percent of gross sales respectively based on gross sales of approximately 160 billion 139 billion and 107 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 160 million in 2018 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 175 million 166 million and 160 million for cash discounts in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively and 191 million 204 million and 242 million for returns in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbotts historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals in the wic business estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott holds the wic contract the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price is reliably determinable rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the us department of agriculture usda and the states submitting rebate claims the usda which administers the wic program has been making its data available for many years management also estimates the states processing lag time based on sales and claims data inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially management has access to several large customers inventory management data which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel at december 31 2018 abbott had wic business in 27 states 

historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items is often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbotts federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former st jude medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013 undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable 

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for years can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2018 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 33 billion and 198 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december 31 2018 goodwill amounted to 233 billion and net intangibles amounted to 189 billion amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to 22 billion in 2018 20 billion in 2017 and 550 million in 2016 there was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2018 2017 and 2016 

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 450 contingencies under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 125 million to 165 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 145 million have been recorded at december 31 2018 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent managements best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 contingencies 

results of operations 

sales 

the following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years 



the increase in total net sales in 2018 reflects the acquisition of alere as well as volume growth across all of abbotts businesses the increase in total net sales in 2017 reflects the acquisitions of st jude medical and alere as well as volume growth in the established pharmaceuticals and diagnostics businesses the price declines related to the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment in 2018 and 2017 primarily reflect pricing pressure on drug eluting stents des as a result of market competition in the us and other major markets 

a comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 



  



nm  percent change is not meaningful 

note in order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates current year us dollar sales are multiplied or divided as appropriate by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided as appropriate by the prior year average foreign exchange rates

excluding the effect of foreign exchange total cardiovascular and neuromodulation products sales grew 49 percent in 2018 the 2018 sales increase was driven by growth in several areas including doubledigit growth in electrophysiology and structural heart 

the growth in electrophysiology in 2018 was led by higher sales in cardiac mapping and ablation catheters as well as the us launch of abbotts confirm rx® insertable cardiac monitor icm the worlds first and only smartphonecompatible icm designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias in may 2018 abbott announced us fda clearance of the advisor hd grid mapping catheter sensor enabled which creates detailed maps of the heart and expands abbotts electrophysiology product portfolio 

growth in structural heart in 2018 was driven by several product areas including the mitraclip abbotts marketleading device for the minimallyinvasive treatment of mitral regurgitation and the amplatzer® pfo occluder a device designed to close a holelike opening in the heart in july 2018 abbott announced us fda approval for a nextgeneration version of mitraclip in september 2018 abbott announced positive clinical results from its coapt study which demonstrated that mitraclip 

improved survival and clinical outcomes for select patients with functional mitral regurgitation in the fourth quarter of 2018 the coapt study data was submitted to the us fda to request approval of an expanded indication for mitraclip 

the growth in neuromodulation in 2018 reflects higher revenue for various products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders 

in vascular growth in imaging vessel closure and other endovascular revenues in 2018 was partially offset by lower des sales due to lower us market share and price erosion in various markets during the second quarter of 2018 abbott received approval from the us fda for the xience sierra drug eluting stent system the newest generation of its coronary stent system during the second quarter of 2018 the xience sierra drug eluting stent system also received national reimbursement in japan to treat people with coronary artery disease in rhythm management market share gains in the new patient segment were offset by replacement cycle dynamics in heart failure international sales growth was offset by lower us sales in october 2018 the heartmate 3 left ventricular assist device lvad received us fda approval as a destination therapy for people living with advanced heart failure 

in 2017 excluding the effect of foreign exchange total cardiovascular and neuromodulation products sales grew 2074 percent the increase in sales was primarily driven by the acquisition of st jude medical which was completed on january 4 2017 excluding the impact of the acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange sales in the vascular business were essentially flat in 2017 versus the prior year as lower coronary stent sales and the comparison impact from the favorable 2016 resolution of a thirdparty royalty agreement were offset by higher structural heart and endovascular sales 

abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were not significant in 2018 2017 and 2016 

the expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect abbott

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 513 percent of net sales in 2018 475 percent in 2017 and 538 percent in 2016 in 2018 the increase primarily reflects lower inventory stepup amortization related to the st jude medical and alere acquisitions and margin improvements in various businesses partially offset by higher intangible amortization expense in 2017 the decrease primarily reflects higher intangible amortization expense and inventory stepup amortization related to the st jude medical and alere acquisitions partially offset by margin improvements in various businesses 

research and development expense was 23 billion in 2018 23 billion in 2017 and 14 billion in 2016 and represented a 17 percent increase in 2018 and a 562 percent increase in 2017 the 2018 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects partially offset by lower restructuring and integration costs the 2017 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the st jude medical business in 2018 research and development expenditures totaled 10 billion for the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products 

segment 585 million for the diagnostic products segment 198 million for the nutritional products segment and 184 million for the established pharmaceutical products segment 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 61 percent in 2018 and 363 percent in 2017 versus the respective prior year the 2018 increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of the alere business in october 2017 as well as higher spending to drive continued growth and market expansion in various businesses partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated expenses the 2017 increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the st jude medical business as well as the incremental expenses to integrate st jude medical with abbotts existing vascular business partially offset by the impact of cost improvement initiatives across various functions and businesses

taxes on earnings 

the income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 188 percent in 2018 842 percent in 2017 and 248 percent in 2016 

the tax cuts and jobs act tcja was enacted in the us on december 22 2017 the tcja reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings as of december 31 2018 abbott has completed its accounting for all of the enactment date income tax effects of the tcja if additional regulations issued by the us department of the treasury after december 31 2018 result in a change in judgment the effect of such regulations will be accounted for in the period in which the regulations are finalized 

effective for fiscal years beginning after december 31 2017 the tcja subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in january 2018 the financial accounting standards board staff provided guidance that an entity may make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes related to items that will give rise to gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year that the tax is incurred abbott has elected to treat the gilti tax as a period expense and provide for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred

exclusive of these discrete items tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in puerto rico switzerland ireland the netherlands costa rica and singapore abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules tax rulings grants and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate 

discontinued operations 

earnings from discontinued operations net of tax of 34 million 124 million and 321 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively were driven primarily by the recognition of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to abbvies operations for years prior to the separation on january 1 2013 abbott completed the separation of abbvie inc abbvie which was formed to hold abbotts researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business abbott has retained all liabilities for all us federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation as well as certain nonincome taxes attributable to abbvies business abbvie generally will be liable for all other taxes attributable to its business

the following is a summary of the assets held for disposition as of december 31 2018 and 2017 



research and development programs 

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical devices diagnostic and nutritional products in development 

research and development process 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segments existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity 

depending upon the product the phases of development may include 

• drug product development • phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceuticals brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api • phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients • phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use • phase iv and other postmarketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china 

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include 

• discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need • conceptfeasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility • development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fdas premarketing approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a biological license application bla 

in the european union eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which is governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category certain product categories require review and approval by an independent 

company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive other products only require a selfcertification process 

in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation selection and qualification of a product design completion of applicable clinical trials to test the products safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications 

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbotts cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 

in the eu cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which is governed by the european medical device directive and the active implantable medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 

after approval and commercial launch of some cardiovascular and neuromodulation products postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 

in the second quarter of 2017 the eu adopted the new medical devices regulation mdr and the in vitro diagnostic regulation ivdr which replace the existing directives in the eu for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic products the mdr and ivdr will apply after a threeyear and fiveyear transition period respectively and will impose additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and supersedes nearly all previously existing revenue recognition guidance the core principle of the asu is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services abbott adopted the new standard as of january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective approach 

method under this method entities recognize the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods presented the cumulative effect of applying the new standard resulted in an increase to earnings employed in the business in the consolidated balance sheet of 23 million which was recorded on january 1 2018 the new standard has been applied only to those contracts that were not completed as of january 1 2018 the impact of adopting asu 201409 was not significant to individual financial statement line items in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of earnings

competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers competitive factors include consumer advertising formulation packaging scientific innovation intellectual property price retail distribution and availability of product forms a significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations the introduction of new products by competitors changes in medical practices and procedures and regulatory changes can result in product 

obsolescence in addition private label and local manufacturers products may increase competitive pressure

information with respect to abbotts business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to abbotts operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and around the world there have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies 

patents trademarks and licenses 

abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for abbotts products in the united states and countries of interest to abbott abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the narrative description of business on pages 1 through 5 these and various patents which expire during the period 2018 to 2038 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbotts business abbott believes that no single patent license or trademark is material in relation to abbotts business as a whole 

seasonal aspects customers backlog and renegotiation 

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbotts business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott orders for abbotts products are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbotts business no material portion of abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government 

research and development 

abbott spent approximately 22 billion in 2017 14 billion in 2016 and 14 billion in 2015 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2017 were approximately 11 million and 37 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2018 are estimated to be 11 million and 39 million respectively 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the 

final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 99000 people as of december 31 2017 

regulation 

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbotts products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices in addition abbotts clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation including registration certification and licensure by federal state and local agencies such as the centers for medicare  medicaid services the drug enforcement adminstration the substance abuse and mental health services administration and their respective foreign counterparts certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance quality control and personnel standards and undergo inspections 

abbotts international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries these may require local investment restrict abbotts investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products 

abbotts home monitoring services and related products that provide abbott and thirdparty medical devices to consumers in the united states are subject to additional federal state and local laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to thirdparty payors medicare medicaid and other thirdparty payors may from time to time conduct inquiries claims audits investigations and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria 

further abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback antiselfreferral and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbotts business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale suspension or revocation of billing privileges and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties similarly compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions including suspension revocation or limitation of a laboratorys certification which is necessary to conduct business as well as significant fines or criminal penalties 

abbotts business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbotts products for the foreseeable future 

in the united states the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices diagnostics supplies and other products as well as the procedures in which these products may be used the government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time for example medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies additionally the protecting access to medicare act establishes a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests which became effective on january 1 2018 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act imposed an excise tax on abbott and other medical device manufacturers and importers the excise tax was subsequently suspended from january 1 2016 through december 31 2017 as part of the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 in january 2018 the excise tax was suspended for an additional two years 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare  medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

policy changes including potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the affordable care act or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to the health care system 

the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information including patient health information and financial information is increasing for example the european union has enacted stricter data protection laws which will take effect in 2018 that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance similarly the us department of health and human services has issued rules governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information and the us food and drug administration has issued further guidance concerning 

cybersecurity for medical devices in addition certain countries have issued or are considering data localization laws which limit companies ability to transfer protected data across country borders failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended and abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area 

governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbotts nutritional products business in the united states for example under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program 

abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the marketing manufacture availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

international operations 

as discussed in greater detail in the section captioned narrative description of business abbott markets products worldwide through affiliates and distributors most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the united states in addition certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines that meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the united states international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbotts securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbotts actual results abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and decrease liquidity 

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned regulation to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts many of abbotts facilities and procedures and those of abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbotts products and criminal prosecution 

these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbotts business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while abbott or abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbotts industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs in the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbotts business 

both in the us and internationally government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs make adverse decisions relating to our products coverage or reimbursement or make changes to patient access to health care all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of abbotts products or the prices that abbotts customers are willing to pay for them 

further in the us a number of the provisions of the us patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 address access to health care products and services and establish certain fees for the medical device industry these provisions may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated in whole or in part future rulemaking could affect rebates prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or required reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law 

for additional information concerning health care regulation see the discussion in regulation under item 1 business 

abbott incurred and assumed significant indebtedness in connection with the acquisitions of st jude medical and alere which could decrease business flexibility and increase consolidated interest expense 

following the acquisitions of st jude medical and alere abbotts consolidated indebtedness as of december 31 2017 was approximately 28 billion this consolidated indebtedness could have the effect among other things of reducing abbotts flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions increasing abbotts consolidated interest expense and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

further abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes abbotts ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors abbotts financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond abbotts control consequently abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on 

terms acceptable to abbott or at all which could adversely impact abbotts ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition 

additionally further borrowing could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating abbotts credit ratings reflect each credit rating agencys then opinion of abbotts financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations adverse changes in abbotts credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities and may limit financing options including access to the unsecured borrowing market abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility 

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on abbotts results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks in addition third party hacking attempts may cause abbotts information technology systems and related products protected data or proprietary information to be compromised a significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences including increased costs and expenses problems with product functionality damage to customer relations lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties 

abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future any significant attack or other disruption on abbotts systems or products could have a material adverse effect on abbotts business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbotts future revenues and operating income 

many of abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbotts intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbotts businesses could suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbotts intellectual property rights abbotts future revenues and operating income could be reduced any material litigation regarding abbotts patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned legal proceedings 

competitors intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbotts revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or technologies or new indications or uses for existing products may cause abbotts products or technologies to become obsolete causing abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer 

new products and technological advances by abbotts competitors may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

abbotts products face intense competition from its competitors products competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbotts products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbotts business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product those products may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other lots batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

significant safety concerns could arise for abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive 

studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbotts products 

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits safety alerts or product recalls and other allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbotts business and reputation and on abbotts ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and abbotts ability to realize projected sales and earnings 

although abbotts financial statements are denominated in us dollars a significant portion of abbotts revenues and costs are realized in other currencies sales outside of the united states in 2017 made up approximately 65 percent of abbotts net sales abbotts profitability is affected by movement of the us dollar against other currencies fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of abbotts assets and liabilities as well as its cash flows some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls while abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks 

information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on abbotts financial results is contained in the financial review — results of operations section in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report a discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in abbotts 2017 form 10k information on abbotts hedging arrangements is contained in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this report

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial review 

abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbotts products under a contract most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs abbotts primary products are nutritional products diagnostic testing products branded generic pharmaceuticals and cardiovascular and neuromodulation products sales in international markets comprise approximately 65 percent of consolidated net sales 

on october 3 2017 abbott acquired alere inc alere a diagnostic device and service provider for 5100 per common share in cash which equated to a purchase price of approximately 45 billion as part of the acquisition abbott tendered for aleres preferred shares for a total value of approximately 07 billion in addition approximately 30 billion of aleres debt was assumed and subsequently repaid the acquisition establishes abbott as a leader in point of care testing expands abbotts global diagnostics presence and provides access to new products channels and geographies abbotts diagnostic products reportable segment includes the results of alere from the date of acquisition 

on january 4 2017 abbott completed the acquisition of st jude medical inc st jude medical a global medical device manufacturer for approximately 236 billion including approximately 136 billion in cash and approximately 10 billion in abbott common shares based on abbotts closing stock price on the acquisition date as part of the acquisition approximately 59 billion of st jude medicals debt was assumed repaid or refinanced by abbott the acquisition provides expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the companys ongoing effort to develop a strong diverse portfolio of devices diagnostics nutritionals and branded generic pharmaceuticals the combined business competes in nearly every area of the 30 billion cardiovascular device market as well as in neuromodulation which treats chronic pain and movement disorders abbotts cardiovascular and neuromodulation reportable segment includes the results of its historical vascular products segment and the results of the businesses acquired from st jude medical from the date of acquisition 

in february 2017 abbott completed the sale of abbott medical optics amo its vision care business to johnson  johnson for 4325 billion in cash the decision to sell amo reflected abbotts proactive shaping of its portfolio in line with its strategic priorities in 2017 abbott recognized a pretax gain of 1163 billion and an aftertax gain of 728 million related to the sale of amo the operating results of amo were included in earnings from continuing operations up to the date of sale as the business did not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations 

on february 27 2015 abbott completed the sale of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business which was previously included in the established pharmaceutical products segment to mylan inc for 110 million ordinary shares of mylan nv a newly formed entity that combined mylans existing business with abbotts developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business abbott retained the branded generics pharmaceuticals business and products of its established pharmaceutical products segment in emerging markets in april 2015 abbott sold 4025 million of its mylan nv ordinary shares and in 2017 abbott sold the remaining 6975 million ordinary shares proceeds from the sale of the 110 million ordinary shares totaled 50 billion 

the sales increase over the last three years was driven primarily by the 2017 acquisitions of st jude medical and alere and sales growth in the established pharmaceuticals and diagnostics businesses in 2017 the acquisitions of st jude medical and alere partially offset by the sale of amo contributed 265 percentage points of abbotts total sales growth sales in emerging markets which represent 

approximately 40 percent of total company sales increased 139 percent in 2017 and 63 percent in 2016 excluding the impact of foreign exchange emerging markets include all countries except the united states western europe japan canada australia and new zealand 

over the last three years abbotts operating margin was impacted by several factors in 2017 abbotts operating margin decreased by approximately 900 basis points primarily due to costs associated with the acquisitions including higher intangible amortization expense inventory stepup amortization and integration costs partially offset by operating margin improvement across various businesses in 2016 and 2015 abbott expanded its operating margin by approximately 120 basis points per year primarily due to margin improvement in the nutritional and diagnostics businesses 

in abbotts worldwide nutritional products business sales over the last three years were positively impacted by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets as well as by numerous new product introductions that leveraged abbotts strong brands these positive factors were offset by challenging conditions in various markets over the last three years in 2017 the nutritionals business experienced growth in the us due to abovemarket performance in abbotts infant and toddler brands including pediasure® pedialyte® and similac® increased 2017 sales in china and india were partially offset by challenging market conditions in the infant formula market in various emerging markets with respect to the profitability of the nutritional products business manufacturing and distribution process changes as well as other cost reductions drove margin improvements across the business over the last three years although such improvements were offset by increased commodity costs in 2017 the decrease in operating margins for this business from 250 percent of sales in 2015 to 229 percent in 2017 was almost entirely due to the negative impact of foreign exchange 

in abbotts worldwide diagnostics business sales growth over the last three years reflected the acquisition of alere in october of 2017 as well as continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the us and china and growth in other emerging markets in addition the point of care diagnostics business experienced sales growth led by the continued adoption of abbotts istat® handheld system worldwide diagnostic sales increased 167 percent in 2017 and 55 percent in 2016 excluding the impact of foreign exchange excluding the impact of the alere acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange sales in the diagnostics products segment increased 55 percent in 2017 in 2017 abbott continued the international rollout of its recently launched alinity systems for the core laboratory including alinity c for clinical chemistry alinity i for immunoassay diagnostics and alinity s for blood and plasma screening in the fourth quarter of 2017 abbott received fda approval in the us for the alinity c and alinity i instruments for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics alinity is an integrated family of nextgeneration diagnostic systems and solutions which are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results 

margin improvement continued to be a key focus for the diagnostics business in 2017 although such improvements were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange operating margins increased from 252 percent of sales in 2015 to 261 percent in 2017 as the business continued to execute on efficiency initiatives in the manufacturing and supply chain functions 

the established pharmaceutical products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets after the sale of its developed markets business to mylan on february 27 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange established pharmaceutical sales from continuing operations increased 95 percent in 2017 and 105 percent in 2016 the sales increase in 2017 was driven by doubledigit growth in china and various countries in latin america operating margins increased from 177 percent of sales in 2015 to 198 percent in 2017 

since the beginning of the first quarter of 2017 the results of abbotts cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment includes abbotts historical vascular products segment and 

st jude medical from the date of acquisition excluding the impact of foreign exchange sales in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment increased 2074 percent in 2017 and 45 percent in 2016 the sales increase in 2017 was driven by the acquisition of st jude medical excluding the impact of the acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange sales in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment were essentially unchanged in 2017 versus the prior year in 2017 higher structural heart and endovascular sales were offset by lower coronary stent sales and the comparison impact from the favorable 2016 resolution of a thirdparty royalty agreement in 2016 sales growth was driven by doubledigit growth in abbotts sales of its mitraclip structural heart device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation as well as endovascular franchise sales growth these increases were partially offset by pricing pressures primarily related to drugeluting stents des and lower market share for abbotts xience des franchise in certain geographies in 2017 operating earnings for this segment increased over 160 percent the operating margin profile declined from 380 percent of sales in 2015 to 305 percent in 2017 primarily due to the mix of business resulting from the acquisition of st jude medical and ongoing pricing pressures in the coronary business 

in 2017 abbott obtained regulatory approval for various products in addition to the approvals described above in the diagnostics business in its cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment abbott received us fda approvals for magnetic resonance mr conditional labeling across its full suite of pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator crtd devices abbott announced ce mark and received us fda clearance for its confirm rx insertable cardiac monitor icm the first and only smartphonecompatible icm designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias abbott received us fda approval for its heartmate 3 system which helps a weak heart pump blood through the body for advanced heart failure patients in need of shortterm hemodynamic support bridgetotransplant or bridge to myocardial recovery abbott obtained ce mark for its xience sierra product which is the next generation of its drugeluting coronary stent system in its diabetes business abbott received us fda approval for its freestyle libre system which is the only continuous glucose monitoring system that does not require any user calibration

critical accounting policies 

sales rebates — in 2017 approximately 43 percent of abbotts consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances in 2017 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care segments abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will 

be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately 28 billion 25 billion and 22 billion respectively or 205 percent 229 percent and 216 percent of gross sales respectively based on gross sales of approximately 139 billion 107 billion and 103 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 139 million in 2017 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 199 million 160 million and 124 million for cash discounts in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively and 204 million 242 million and 238 million for returns in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbotts historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management has access to several large customers inventory management data and for other customers utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the states and internally administered market research the usda has been making its data available for many years internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data at december 31 2017 abbott had wic business in 29 states 

historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items is often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbotts federal income tax returns through 2013 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former alere consolidated group which are settled through 2012 no additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the us tax cuts and jobs act or any additional outside basis differences that exist as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the 

obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for years can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2017 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 35 billion and 248 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december 31 2017 goodwill amounted to 240 billion and intangibles amounted to 215 billion amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to 20 billion in 2017 550 million in 2016 and 601 million in 2015 there was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2017 2016 and 2015 

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 450 contingencies under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 115 million to 160 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 135 million have been recorded at december 31 2017 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent managements best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 contingencies 

results of operations 

sales 

the following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years 



the increase in total net sales in 2017 reflects the acquisitions of st jude medical and alere as well as organic growth in the established pharmaceuticals and diagnostics businesses the increase in 2016 reflects unit growth partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange the price declines related to the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment in 2017 and 2016 primarily reflect pricing pressure on drug eluting stents des as a result of market competition in the us and other major markets 

a comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 



nm  percent change is not meaningful 



note in order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates current year us dollar sales are multiplied or divided as appropriate by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided as appropriate by the prior year average foreign exchange rates 

total established pharmaceutical products sales increased 95 percent in 2017 and 105 percent in 2016 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the established pharmaceutical products segment is focused on several key emerging markets including india russia china and brazil excluding the impact of foreign exchange total sales in these key emerging markets increased 119 percent in 2017 and 133 percent in 2016 excluding the impact of foreign exchange 2017 sales in several geographies including china and various countries in latin america experienced doubledigit growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange sales in established pharmaceuticals other emerging markets increased 22 percent in 2017 and increased 20 percent in 2016 the 2017 sales growth for established pharmaceuticals other emerging markets includes the unfavorable impact of venezuelan operations excluding venezuela and the effect of foreign exchange sales in other emerging markets increased 75 percent 

total nutritional products sales increased 06 percent in 2017 and 12 percent in 2016 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in abbotts international pediatric nutritional business the 2017 decrease in sales was driven by challenging market conditions in the infant formula market in various emerging markets partially offset by growth in china and india the 2017 growth in china reflects a partial recovery from the 2016 sales decline in china the 2016 decrease in sales was driven by challenging market conditions in china including the impact of new food safety regulations which contributed to an oversupply of product in the market the 2016 sales decrease in china was partially offset by strong performance in several markets across latin america and southeast asia 

the increases in us pediatric nutritional 2017 and 2016 sales primarily reflect continued abovemarket performance in abbotts infant and toddler brands including pediasure® pedialyte® and similac® 

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange the 2017 and 2016 increases in international adult nutritional sales are due primarily to growth in ensure® abbotts marketleading complete and balanced nutrition brand as well as volume growth in emerging markets and continued expansion of the adult nutrition category internationally us adult nutritional revenues decreased in 2017 due to competitive and market dynamics while sales increased in 2016 driven by the growth of ensure® sales 

total diagnostic products sales increased 167 percent in 2017 and 55 percent in 2016 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the sales increase in 2017 included the acquisition of alere which was completed on october 3 2017 excluding the impact of the acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange sales in the diagnostics products segment increased 55 percent primarily driven by share gains in the core laboratory markets globally as well as strong performance in point of care led by the continued adoption of abbotts istat® handheld system the 2016 sales increase was primarily driven by share gains in the core laboratory and point of care markets in the us and internationally 

excluding the effect of foreign exchange total cardiovascular and neuromodulation products sales grew 2074 percent in 2017 and 45 percent in 2016 the sales increase in 2017 was primarily driven by the acquisition of st jude medical which was completed on january 4 2017 excluding the impact of the acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange sales in the vascular business were essentially flat in 2017 versus the prior year as lower coronary stent sales and the comparison impact from the favorable 2016 resolution of a thirdparty royalty agreement were offset by higher structural heart and endovascular sales in 2016 doubledigit growth in sales of abbotts mitraclip structural heart device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation was partially offset by lower sales of des products the increase in the endovascular business was driven by higher supera and vessel closure sales cardiovascular and neuromodulation products sales in 2016 were also favorably impacted by the resolution of previously disputed third party royalty revenue related to the prior year excluding this royalty impact worldwide sales of cardiovascular and neuromodulation products would have increased 34 percent in 2016 

abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were not significant in 2017 2016 and 2015 

the expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect abbott

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 477 percent of net sales in 2017 541 percent in 2016 and 542 percent in 2015 in 2017 the decrease primarily reflects higher intangible amortization expense and inventory stepup amortization related to the st jude medical and alere acquisitions partially offset by margin improvements in various businesses in 2016 the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange offset continued underlying margin expansion primarily in the diagnostics and nutritional segments 

research and development expense was 2235 billion in 2017 1422 billion in 2016 and 1405 billion in 2015 and represented a 572 percent increase in 2017 and a 12 percent increase in 2016 the 2017 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the st jude medical business the 2016 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects and the impairment of an inprocess research and development asset related to a nonreportable segment partially offset by lower restructuring costs in 2016 in 2017 research and development expenditures totaled 526 million for the diagnostics products segment 967 million for the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment 195 million for the nutritional products segment and 164 million for the established pharmaceutical products segment 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 366 percent in 2017 and decreased 17 percent in 2016 versus the respective prior year the 2017 increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the st jude medical business as well as the incremental expenses to integrate st jude medical with abbotts existing vascular business partially offset by the impact of cost improvement initiatives across various functions and businesses the 2016 decrease reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange continued efforts to reduce back office costs and lower restructuring charges compared to the prior year

taxes on earnings 

the income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 842 percent in 2017 248 percent in 2016 and 181 percent in 2015 

the tax cuts and jobs act tcja was enacted in the us on december 22 2017 the tcja reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requires companies to pay a onetime 

transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 abbott recorded an estimate of net tax expense of 146 billion for the impact of the tcja which is included in taxes on earnings from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of earnings the estimate is provisional and includes a charge of approximately 289 billion for the transition tax partially offset by a net benefit of approximately 142 billion for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and a net benefit of approximately 10 million related to certain other impacts of the tcja 

the onetime transition tax is based on abbotts total post1986 earnings and profits ep that were previously deferred from us income taxes abbott has not yet completed its calculation of the total post1986 ep for its foreign subsidiaries the tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post1986 ep considered held in cash and other specified assets this amount may change as abbott finalizes the calculation of post1986 foreign ep previously deferred from us federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in cash and other specified assets abbott plans to elect to pay the transition tax over eight years as allowed by the tcja 

given the significant complexity of the tcja abbott will continue to evaluate and analyze the impact of this legislation the 146 billion estimate is provisional and is based on abbotts initial analysis of the tcja and may be materially adjusted in future periods due to among other things additional analysis performed by abbott and additional guidance that may be issued by the us department of treasury the securities and exchange commission or the financial accounting standards board 

in 2017 taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include 435 million of tax expense related to the gain on the sale of the amo business 

in 2016 taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the impact of a net tax benefit of approximately 225 million primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions from prior years partially offset by the unfavorable impact of nondeductible foreign exchange losses related to venezuela and the adjustment of the mylan nv equity investment as well as the recognition of deferred taxes associated with the then pending sale of amo in 2015 taxes on earnings from continuing operations include 71 million of tax expense related to gain on the disposal of shares of mylan nv stock the 2015 effective tax rate includes the impact of the rd tax credit that was made permanent in the us by the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 

exclusive of these discrete items tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in puerto rico switzerland ireland the netherlands costa rica and singapore abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules tax rulings grants and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate 

earnings from discontinued operations net of tax in 2017 and 2016 reflect the recognition of 109 million and 325 million respectively of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years 2015 tax expense related to discontinued operations includes 667 million of tax expense on certain currentyear income earned outside of the us that were not designated as permanently reinvested overseas

the following is a summary of the assets and liabilities held for disposition as of december 31 2017 and 2016 



research and development programs 

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical devices diagnostic and nutritional products in development 

research and development process 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segments existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity 

depending upon the product the phases of development may include 

• drug product development • phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceuticals brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api • phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients • phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use • phase iv and other postmarketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china 

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include 

• discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need • conceptfeasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility • development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fdas premarketing approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a biological license application bla 

in the eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which is governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive other products only require a selfcertification process 

in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation selection and qualification of a product design completion of applicable clinical trials to test the products safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications 

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbotts cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 

in the eu cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which is governed by the european medical device directive and the active implantable medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 

after approval and commercial launch of some cardiovascular and neuromodulation products postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 

in the second quarter of 2017 the eu adopted the new medical devices regulation mdr and the in vitro diagnostic regulation ivdr which replace the existing directives in the eu for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic products the mdr and ivdr will apply after a threeyear and fiveyear transition 

period respectively and will impose additional regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products 

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants and adults or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a products efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted 

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fdas confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutritional products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products 

areas of focus 

in 2018 and beyond abbotts significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following 

established pharmaceuticals — abbott focuses on building countryspecific portfolios made up of highquality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets more than 400 development projects are active for one or several emerging markets over the next several years abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new offpatent and differentiated medicines in addition abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as creon duphaston duphalac and influvac depending on the product the activities focus on development of new data markets formulations delivery systems or indications 

cardiovascular and neuromodulation — abbotts research and development programs focus on 

• cardiac rhythm management — development of nextgeneration rhythm management technologies including enhanced patient engagement and expanded magnetic resonance mrcompatibility • heart failure — continued enhancements to abbotts left ventricular assist systems and pulmonary artery heart failure system including enhanced connectivity userinterfaces and remote patient monitoring • electrophysiology — development of nextgeneration technologies in the areas of ablation diagnostic mapping and visualization and recording and monitoring • vascular — development of nextgeneration technologies for use in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures • structural heart — development of minimallyinvasive devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves and other structural heart conditions • neuromodulation — development of nextgeneration technologies with unique wave forms enhanced patient and physician engagement and expanded mrcompatibility to treat chronic pain movement disorders and other indications diabetes care — develop enhancements and additional indications for the freestyle libre continuous glucose monitoring system to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes 

core laboratory diagnostics — abbott continues to commercialize its nextgeneration blood screening immunoassay clinical chemistry and hematology systems along with assays in various areas including infectious disease cardiac care metabolics oncology as well as informatics and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories 

molecular diagnostics — several new molecular in vitro diagnostic ivd products and a next generation instrument system are in various stages of development and launch 

rapid diagnostics — abbotts research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for cardiometabolic disease infectious disease and toxicology 

nutritionals — abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric adult and performance nutrition areas gastro intestinalimmunity health brain health mobility and metabolism and user experience platforms numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development including clinical outcome testing and are expected to be launched over the coming years 

given the diversity of abbotts business its intention to remain a broadbased healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbotts overall market position there were no delays in abbotts 2017 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbotts ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical medical device and diagnostic products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates and such spending is expected to approximate 75 percent of total abbott sales in 2018 abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period 

goodwill 

at december 31 2017 goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled 240 billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 

financial condition 

cash flow 

net cash from operating activities amounted to 56 billion 32 billion and 30 billion in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2017 was primarily due to the favorable impact of improved working capital management the acquisition of the st jude medical businesses and higher segment operating earnings the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2016 reflects additional focus on the management of working capital the income tax component of operating cash flow in 2017 includes the 2017 noncash impact of 146 billion of net tax expense related to 

the estimated impact of us tax reform the income tax component of operating cash flow in 2016 and 2015 includes 550 million and 70 million respectively of noncash tax benefits primarily related to the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years 2015 reflects the noncash impact of approximately 11 billion of tax expense associated with the gain on sale of businesses 

the foreign currency loss related to venezuela reduced abbotts cash by approximately 410 million in 2016 and is included in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents line within the consolidated statement of cash flows future fluctuations in the strength of the us dollar against foreign currencies are not expected to materially impact abbotts liquidity 

while a significant portion of abbotts cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2017 are reinvested in foreign subsidiaries abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources due to the enactment of the tcja if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds

market price sensitive investments 

the fair value of the availableforsale equity securities held by abbott was approximately 11 million and 27 billion as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the yearoveryear decrease is primarily due to sale of the remaining ordinary shares of mylan nv that abbott received in the sale of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business as of december 31 2017 abbott no longer held an ownership interest in mylan nv all availableforsale equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value a hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at december 31 2017 by approximately 2 million abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in fair value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in fair value occurs abbott also holds 363 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan these investments are classified as trading securities

interest rate sensitive financial instruments 

at december 31 2017 and 2016 abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 40 billion and 55 billion respectively to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged abbott does not use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities the fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2017 and 2016 amounted to 290 billion and 211 billion respectively average interest rates of 36 and 38 as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively with maturities through 2046 at december 31 2017 and 2016 the fair value of current and longterm investment securities amounted to approximately 11 billion and 31 billion respectively a hypothetical 100basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows income or fair values a 100basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in rates 

foreign currency sensitive financial instruments 

certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are markedtomarket with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold generally within the next twelve to eighteen months at december 31 2017 and 2016 abbott held 33 billion and 26 billion respectively of such contracts contracts held at december 31 2017 will mature in 2018 or 2019 depending upon the contract contracts held at december 31 2016 matured in 2017 or will mature in 2018 depending upon the contract at december 31 2016 107 million of the notional amount related to amo a business that was divested in the first quarter of 2017 

abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and thirdparty trade payables and receivables the contracts are markedtomarket and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed at december 31 2017 and 2016 abbott held 201 billion and 149 billion respectively of such contracts which generally mature in the next twelve months at december 31 2016 12 billion of the contracts related to amo a business that was divested in the first quarter of 2017 

in march 2017 abbott repaid its 479 million foreign denominated shortterm debt which was designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary at december 31 2016 and 2015 the value of this shortterm debt was 454 million and 439 million respectively and changes in the fair value of the debt up through the date of repayment due to changes in exchange rates were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax

information with respect to abbotts business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to abbotts operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and around the world there have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies 

patents trademarks and licenses 

abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for abbotts products in the united states and countries of interest to abbott abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the narrative description of business on pages 1 through 5 these and various patents which expire during the period 2017 to 2037 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbotts business abbott believes that no single patent license or trademark is material in relation to abbotts business as a whole 

seasonal aspects customers backlog and renegotiation 

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbotts business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott orders for abbotts products are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbotts business no material portion of abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government 

research and development 

abbott spent approximately 14 billion in 2016 14 billion in 2015 and 13 billion in 2014 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2016 were approximately 19 million and 35 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2017 are estimated to be 19 million and 38 million respectively 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 75000 people as of december 31 2016 following the acquisition of st jude medical abbott employs approximately 94000 people 

regulation 

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbotts products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbotts international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries these may require local investment restrict abbotts investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products in addition abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbotts business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority 

necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

abbotts business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbotts products for the foreseeable future 

in the united states the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical procedures in which medical devices and diagnostics may be used the government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare also implemented a competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies additionally the protecting access to medicare act establishes a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests which goes into effect in 2018 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act imposed an excise tax on abbott and other medical device manufacturers and importers the excise tax was subsequently suspended from january 1 2016 through december 31 2017 as part of the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 the excise tax is scheduled to apply to sales of taxable medical devices beginning on january 1 2018 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

policy changes including potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the affordable care act or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to the health care system 

the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain patient health information is increasing for example the european union has enacted stricter data protection laws which will take effect in 2018 that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance similarly the us department of health and human services has issued rules governing the use disclosure and 

security of protected health information and the us food and drug administration has issued further guidance concerning data security for medical devices in addition certain countries have issued or are considering data localization laws which limit companies ability to transfer protected data across country borders failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties transferring and managing protected health information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended and abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area 

governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbotts nutritional products business in the united states for example under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program 

abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the marketing manufacture availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

international operations 

as discussed in greater detail in the section captioned narrative description of business abbott markets products worldwide through affiliates and distributors most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the united states in addition certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the united states international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbotts securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbotts actual results abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and decrease liquidity 

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned regulation to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts many of abbotts facilities and procedures and those of abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbotts products and criminal prosecution 

these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbotts business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while abbott or abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbotts industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs in the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbotts business 

both in the us and internationally government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs make adverse decisions relating to our products coverage or reimbursement or make changes to patient access to health care all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of abbotts products or the prices that abbotts customers are willing to pay for them 

further in the us a number of the provisions of the us patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 change access to health care products and services and establish certain fees for the medical device industry these provisions may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated in whole or in part future rulemaking could affect rebates prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or required reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law 

for additional information concerning health care regulation see the discussion in regulation under item 1 business 

abbott incurred and assumed significant additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of st jude medical which could decrease business flexibility and increase consolidated interest expense 

following the acquisition of st jude medical abbotts consolidated indebtedness as of january 31 2017 is approximately 278 billion representing a substantial increase in comparison to abbotts consolidated indebtedness on a recent historical basis this increased consolidated indebtedness could have the effect among other things of reducing abbotts flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions increasing abbotts consolidated interest expense and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

further abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes abbotts ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors abbotts financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond abbotts control consequently abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on 

terms acceptable to abbott or at all which could adversely impact abbotts ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition additionally further borrowing could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating 

changes in credit markets or to abbotts credit rating could impact abbotts ability to obtain financing for its business operations or result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

abbotts credit ratings reflect each credit rating agencys then opinion of abbotts financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations abbott utilizes the short and longterm debt markets to obtain capital from time to time adverse changes in abbotts credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities and may limit financing options including access to the unsecured borrowing market abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility macroeconomic conditions such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets may adversely affect abbotts ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capitalintensive internal initiatives 

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on abbotts results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks in addition third party hacking attempts may cause abbotts information technology systems and related products protected data or proprietary information to be compromised a significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences including increased costs and expenses problems with product functionality damage to customer relations lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties 

abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future any significant attack or other disruption on abbotts systems or products could have a material adverse effect on abbotts business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbotts future revenues and operating income 

many of abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbotts intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbotts businesses could suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbotts intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property abbotts future revenues and operating income could be reduced any material litigation regarding abbotts patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned legal proceedings 

competitors intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbotts revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or technologies or new indications or uses for existing products may cause abbotts products or technologies to become obsolete causing abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer 

new products and technological advances by abbotts competitors may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

abbotts products face intense competition from its competitors products competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbotts products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbotts business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause 

similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

significant safety concerns could arise for abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbotts products

critical accounting policies 

sales rebates — in 2016 approximately 43 percent of abbotts consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances in 2016 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care segments abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2016 2015 and 2014 amounted to approximately 25 billion 22 billion and 21 billion respectively or 229 percent 216 percent and 201 percent respectively based on gross sales of approximately 107 billion 103 billion and 103 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 107 million in 2016 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 160 million 124 million and 138 million for cash discounts in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively and 242 million 238 million and 210 million for returns in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbotts historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management has access to several large customers inventory management data and for other customers utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the states and internally administered market research the usda has been making its data available for many years internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data at december 31 2016 abbott had wic business in 31 states 

historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items is often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment 

amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbotts federal income tax returns through 2013 are settled abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for years can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2016 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 33 billion and 119 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december 31 2016 goodwill amounted to 77 billion and intangibles amounted to 45 billion excluding approximately 20 billion of goodwill and 529 million of intangibles in noncurrent assets held for disposition due to the pending sale of amo amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to 550 million in 2016 601 million in 2015 and 555 million in 2014 there were no impairments of goodwill in 2016 2015 or 2014 

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 450 contingencies under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional 

information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 35 million to 45 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 40 million have been recorded at december 31 2016 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent managements best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 contingencies 

results of operations 

sales 

the following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years 



the increases in total net sales in 2016 and 2015 reflect unit growth partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange the price declines related to vascular products sales in 2016 and 2015 primarily reflect pricing pressure on drug eluting stents as a result of market competition in the us and other major markets competitive pressures in the managed medicaid and medicare segments of abbotts diabetes care business also contributed to the overall 29 price decline in the us in 2016 

a comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 



1 coronary devices include des  bvs product portfolio structural heart guidewires balloon catheters and other coronary products endovascular includes vessel closure carotid stents and other peripheral products 



2 coronary devices include des  bvs product portfolio structural heart guidewires balloon catheters and other coronary products endovascular includes vessel closure carotid stents and other peripheral products 

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange total established pharmaceutical products sales increased 105 percent in 2016 and 341 percent in 2015 the established pharmaceutical products 

segment is focused on several key emerging markets including india russia china and brazil excluding the impact of foreign exchange sales in these key emerging markets increased 133 percent in 2016 and 324 percent in 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange sales in established pharmaceuticals other emerging markets increased 20 percent in 2016 and increased 396 percent in 2015 the increase in 2015 includes the impact of the acquisitions of cfr pharmaceuticals in september 2014 and veropharm in december 2014 excluding sales from the acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange revenues increased 134 percent in 2015 

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange total nutritional products sales increased 12 percent in 2016 and 55 percent in 2015 in abbotts international pediatric nutritional business the 2016 decrease in sales was driven by challenging market conditions in china including the impact of new food safety regulations which will require the reregistration by 2018 of all infant and toddler formulas contributing to an oversupply of product in the market the sales decrease in china was partially offset by continued strong performance in several markets across latin america and southeast asia the increase in 2016 us pediatric nutritional sales primarily reflects abovemarket performance in abbotts pediasure® toddler brand as well as recent infant product launches including similac® advance® nongmo and similac sensitive® nongmo 

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange the 2016 and 2015 increases in international adult nutritional sales are due primarily to volume growth in emerging markets and continued expansion of the adult nutrition category internationally the increase in 2016 us adult nutritional revenues was driven by the growth of ensure® sales and the decrease in 2015 reflected the effects of increased competition and market dynamics in retail and institutional categories 

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange total diagnostic products sales increased 55 percent in 2016 and 73 percent in 2015 the sales increases were primarily driven by share gains in the core laboratory and point of care markets in the us and internationally 2016 and 2015 sales of immunochemistry products the largest category in this segment reflect continued execution of abbotts strategy to deliver integrated solutions to large healthcare customers 

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange total vascular products sales grew 45 percent in 2016 and 13 percent in 2015 in 2016 doubledigit growth in sales of abbotts mitraclip structural heart device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation was partially offset by lower sales of des products the increase in the endovascular business was driven by higher supera and vessel closure sales vascular products sales in 2016 were also favorably impacted by the resolution of previously disputed third party royalty revenue related to the prior year excluding this royalty impact worldwide sales of vascular products would have increased 34 percent in 2016 in 2015 growth of abbotts mitraclip structural heart product its endovascular business including the supera peripheral stent and the absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold in various international markets was almost entirely offset by pricing pressures in des products 

abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were not significant in 2016 2015 and 2014 

the expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to affect abbott 

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 541 percent of net sales in 2016 542 percent in 2015 and 517 percent in 2014 in 2016 the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange offset continued underlying margin expansion 

primarily in the diagnostics and nutritional segments the improvement in 2015 reflects higher margins in the nutritional diagnostics and vascular products segments 

in the us states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products in numerous countries these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional and established pharmaceutical products segments 

research and development expense was 1422 billion in 2016 1405 billion in 2015 and 1345 billion in 2014 and represented a 12 percent increase in 2016 and a 45 percent increase in 2015 the 2016 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects and the impairment of an inprocess research and development asset related to a nonreportable segment partially offset by lower restructuring costs in 2016 in 2016 research and development expenditures totaled 513 million for the diagnostics products segment 259 million for the vascular products segment 205 million for the nutritional products segment and 137 million for the established pharmaceutical products segment 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 17 percent in 2016 and increased 39 percent in 2015 versus the respective prior year the 2016 decrease reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange continued efforts to reduce back office costs and lower restructuring charges compared to the prior year the 2015 increase reflects the impact of the cfr and veropharm acquisitions partially offset by the impact of cost improvement initiatives and the favorable impact of foreign exchange

depending upon the product the phases of development may include 

• drug product development 39 

• phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceuticals brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api • phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients • phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use • phase iv and other postmarketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china 

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include 

• discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need • conceptfeasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility • development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fdas premarketing approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a biological license application bla 

in the eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which is governed by the european invitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive other products only require a selfcertification process 

in the vascular segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design completion of clinical trials to test the products safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications 

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us vascular products are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbotts vascular products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 

in the eu vascular products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which is governed by the european medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive some products require submission of a design dossier to 

the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 

after approval and commercial launch of some vascular products postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants and adults or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a products efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted 

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fdas confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutritional products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products 

areas of focus 

in 2017 and beyond abbotts significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following 

established pharmaceuticals — abbott focuses on building country specific portfolios made up of global and local pharmaceutical brands that best meet the needs of patients in emerging markets more than 400 development projects are active for one or several emerging markets over the next several years established pharmaceuticals plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new branded generic medicines for particular pharmaceutical products in addition established pharmaceuticals continues to expand existing brands into new markets implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as creon duphaston and influvac depending on the product the activities focus on development of new data markets formulations delivery systems or indications 

vascular — ongoing projects in the pipeline include 

• mitraclip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation consistent with abbotts nearterm vision to grow its mitral and tricuspid valve programs abbott continues to work on expanding the use of its mitraclip device clinical trials for mitraclip are underway with the objective of broadening mitraclips footprint into new key markets and enrollment of the coapt trial a study of safety and effectiveness of the mitraclip device in heart failure patients with functional mitral regurgitation is projected to be completed in 2017 leveraging expertise in percutaneous leaflet coaptation abbott is working to expand its clipbased technology to address unmet needs in tricuspid regurgitation • portico resheathable transcatheter aortic valve system us clinical trial the objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the portico transcatheter heart valve and delivery systems via transfemoral and alternative delivery methods • thoratec momentum 3 multicenter study of maglev technology with heartmate 3™ hm3 clinical study protocol the objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the hm3 left ventricular assist system lvas when used for the treatment of advanced 41 

refractory left ventricular heart failure the short term arm of the study is complete and results were presented at the american heart association in november 2016 the long term arm requires twoyear patient followup the hm3 is intended for use inside or outside the hospital 

• amplatzer™ amulet™ laa occluder trial the objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this device in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients who are eligible for the trial will be randomized to receive either the amulet device or the commercially available watchman device and will be followed for 5 years after device implant • tendyne transcatheter mitral valve replacement device this device is a selfexpanding fully retrievable and repositionable bioprosthesis with a simple and controlled deployment procedure the trial to support ce mark began in 2016 and is projected to be completed in 2017 • supera selfexpanding nitinol stent system which was acquired as part of the acquisition of idev technologies in august 2013 with its proprietary interwoven wire technology supera is designed based on biomimetic principles to mimic the bodys natural movement supera is available in the us europe and various countries in asia the middle east and latin america for the treatment of blockages in blood vessels due to peripheral artery disease with expanded size matrix approved in the us abbott is developing supera s next generation delivery system • abbott is also developing future versions of metallic des guide wires and balloon delivery catheters molecular diagnostics — various new molecular in vitro diagnostic ivd products and next generation instrument systems are in various stages of development and commercialization 

core laboratory diagnostics — abbott continues to commercialize its nextgeneration blood screening immunoassay clinical chemistry and hematology systems along with assays in various areas including infectious disease cardiac care metabolics oncology as well as informatics and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories 

diabetes care — in 2016 abbott expanded on the results of its replace outcome trial which covered type 2 diabetes patients with the publication of the results of its impact study which showed improved glycemic outcomes in people with type 1 diabetes using the freestyle libre system the freestyle libre system eliminates the need for routine finger sticks by reading glucose levels through a sensor that can be worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days it also requires no finger sticks for calibration in 2014 abbott attained the ce mark in europe for the freestyle libre system in 2016 abbott launched two apps in europe for freestyle libre librelink which enables people with diabetes to access glucose data directly from their freestyle libre sensor on their android smartphones and librelinkup a caregiver app for remotely monitoring glucose values in the us in the third quarter of 2016 abbott received fda approval for freestyle libre pro which is designed to be used by healthcare professionals in a clinic setting and submitted the pma for a consumer version of freestyle libre 

nutritionals — abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric adult and performance nutrition areas gastro intestinalimmunity health brain health mobility and metabolism and user experience platforms numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development including clinical outcome testing and are expected to be launched over the coming years 

given the diversity of abbotts business its intention to remain a broadbased healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and 

impact of a new product on abbotts overall market position there were no delays in abbotts 2016 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbotts ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical medical device and diagnostic products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates and such spending is expected to approximate 75 percent of total abbott sales in 2017 abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period 

goodwill 

at december 31 2016 goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled 77 billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 

financial condition 

cash flow 

net cash from operating activities amounted to 32 billion 30 billion and 37 billion in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2016 reflects additional focus on the management of working capital the decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2015 was due in large part to the divestiture of the developed market established pharmaceuticals business in february 2015 as well as an increase in contributions to defined benefit plans in 2015 the income tax component of operating cash flow in 2016 2015 and 2014 includes 550 million 70 million and 268 million respectively of noncash tax benefits primarily related to the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years 2015 reflects the noncash impact of approximately 11 billion of tax expense associated with the gain on sale of businesses 

the foreign currency loss related to venezuela reduced abbotts cash by approximately 410 million in 2016 and is included in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents line within the consolidated statement of cash flows future fluctuations in the strength of the us dollar against foreign currencies are not expected to materially impact abbotts liquidity 

excluding the proceeds from the november 2016 longterm debt issuance over 85 of the cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016 is considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott may be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbott believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2016 can be considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

abbott funded 582 million in 2016 579 million in 2015 and 393 million in 2014 to defined benefit pension plans abbott expects pension funding of approximately 364 million in 2017 for its pension plans of which approximately 270 million relates to its main domestic pension plan abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends

abbott declared dividends of 1045 per share in 2016 compared to 098 per share in 2015 an increase of approximately 7 dividends paid were 1539 billion in 2016 compared to 1443 billion in 2015 the yearoveryear change in dividends reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate 

working capital 

working capital was 201 billion at december 31 2016 and 50 billion at december 31 2015 the increase in working capital in 2016 was due to a 136 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents and a 18 billion reduction in shortterm borrowings resulting from the proceeds from the longterm debt issued in november 2016 as well as cash generated from operating activities on january 4 2017 approximately 136 billion of the 186 billion in cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016 was used to fund the cash portion of the acquisition of st jude medical 

substantially all of abbotts trade receivables in italy spain portugal and greece are with governmental health systems the collection of outstanding receivables in these countries was stable in 2015 and 2016 governmental receivables in these four countries accounted for less than 1 percent of abbotts total assets in both years and 6 percent of total net trade receivables as of december 31 2016 down from 7 percent as of december 31 2015 

with the exception of greece abbott historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries abbott continues to monitor the credit worthiness of customers located in these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected in addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments in these countries abbott regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbott also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbott may not be able to collect the entire balance 

venezuela operations 

since january 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap in 2014 and 2015 the government of venezuela operated multiple mechanisms to exchange bolivars into us dollars these mechanisms included the cencoex sicad and simadi rates which stood at 63 135 and approximately 200 respectively at december 31 2015 in 2015 abbott continued to use the cencoex rate of 63 venezuelan bolivars to the us dollar to report the results financial position and cash flows related to its operations in venezuela since abbott continued to qualify for this exchange rate to pay for the import of various products into venezuela 

on february 17 2016 the venezuelan government announced that the threetier exchange rate system would be reduced to two rates renamed the dipro and dicom rates the dipro rate is the official rate for food and medicine imports and was adjusted from 63 to 10 bolivars per us dollar the dicom rate is a floating market rate published daily by the venezuelan central bank which at the end of the first quarter of 2016 was approximately 263 bolivars per us dollar as a result of decreasing government approvals to convert bolivars to us dollars to pay for intercompany accounts as well as the accelerating deterioration of economic conditions in the country abbott concluded that it was appropriate to move to the dicom rate at the end of the first quarter of 2016 as a result abbott recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of 480 million in 2016 to revalue its net monetary assets in venezuela abbott is continuing to use the dicom rate to report the results of operations and to remeasure net monetary assets for venezuela at the end of each quarter as of december 31 2016 abbotts venezuelan operations represented approximately 01 of abbotts consolidated assets and any additional foreign currency losses related to venezuela are not expected to be material 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures of 11 billion in 2016 2015 and 2014 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments investments in information technology and laboratory instruments placed with customers 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 



a purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements b net unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately 560 million are excluded from the table above as abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items see note 14 — taxes on earnings from continuing operations for further details the company has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postemployment benefits including medical and life which have been excluded from the table a discussion of the companys pension and postretirement plans including funding matters is included in note 13 — postemployment benefits 

contingent obligations 

abbott has periodically entered into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business such as assignment of product rights which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these obligations based upon past experience the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote in addition abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events 

legislative issues 

abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors 

recently issued accounting standards 

in october 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201616 income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory  which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs the standard becomes effective for abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2018 and early adoption is permitted abbott is currently evaluating the impact asu 201616 will have on its consolidated financial statements

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and will supersede most existing revenue recognition guidance the standard becomes effective for abbott in the first quarter of 2018 abbott is continuing to evaluate the effect that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures including the areas of variable consideration and new disclosure requirements abbott will continue to monitor additional modifications clarifications or interpretations undertaken by the fasb that may impact abbotts current conclusions abbott is currently expecting to use the modified retrospective method to adopt this standard 

private securities litigation reform act of 1995 — a caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 abbott cautions investors that any forwardlooking statements or projections made by abbott including those made in this document are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect abbotts operations are discussed in item 1a risk factors 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and risk management 

market price sensitive investments 

the fair value of the availableforsale equity securities held by abbott was approximately 27 billion and 38 billion as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the yearoveryear decrease is primarily due to a decline in the share price of the ordinary shares of mylan nv that abbott received in the sale of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business and that it continued to hold at december 31 2016 all availableforsale equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value a hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at december 31 2016 by approximately 540 million abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in fair value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in fair value occurs 

nonpublicly traded equity securities 

abbott holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges the carrying value of these investments was approximately 151 million and 120 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively no individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of 35 million abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated fair value occurs 

interest rate sensitive financial instruments 

at december 31 2016 and 2015 abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 55 billion and 40 billion respectively to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged abbott does not use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities at december 31 2016 abbott had 09 billion of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 091 with an average remaining life of 17 days the fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2016 and 2015 amounted to 211 billion and 63 billion respectively average interest rates of 38 and 41 as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively with maturities through 2046 at december 31 2016 and 2015 the fair value of current and longterm investment securities amounted to approximately 31 billion and 52 billion respectively a hypothetical 100basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows income or fair values a 100basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in rates 

foreign currency sensitive financial instruments 

certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are markedtomarket with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold generally within the next twelve to eighteen months at december 31 2016 and 2015 abbott held 26 billion and 24 billion respectively of such contracts contracts held at december 31 2016 will mature in 2017 or 2018 depending upon the contract contracts held at december 31 2015 matured in 2016 or will mature in 2017 depending upon the contract at december 31 2016 107 million of the notional amount relates to amo a business that is expected to be divested in the first quarter of 2017 

abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and thirdparty trade payables and receivables the contracts are markedtomarket and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed at december 31 2016 and 2015 abbott held 149 billion and 140 billion respectively of such contracts which generally mature in the next twelve months at december 31 2016 12 billion of the contracts relate to amo a business that is expected to be divested in the first quarter of 2017 

abbott has designated foreign denominated shortterm debt of approximately 454 million and approximately 439 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary accordingly changes in the fair value of this debt due to changes in exchange rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax 

the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2016 and 2015

information with respect to abbotts business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to abbotts operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and around the world there have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies 

patents trademarks and licenses 

abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for abbotts products in the united states and countries of interest to abbott abbott owns and is licensed under a substantial number of patents and patent applications principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the narrative description of business on pages 1 through 5 these and various patents which expire during the period 2016 to 2036 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbotts business abbott believes that no single patent license or trademark is material in relation to abbotts business as a whole 

seasonal aspects customers backlog and renegotiation 

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbotts business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott orders for abbotts products are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbotts business no material portion of abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government 

research and development 

abbott spent approximately 14 billion in 2015 13 billion in 2014 and 14 billion in 2013 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2015 were approximately 14 million and 36 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2016 are estimated to be 14 million and 38 million respectively 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency epa or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 74000 people as of december 31 2015 

regulation 

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbotts products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbotts international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries these may require local investment restrict abbotts investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products in addition abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbotts business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

abbotts business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbotts products for the foreseeable future 

in the united states the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical procedures in which medical devices and diagnostics may be used the government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health 

care products abbott and other companies that sell medical devices were obligated to pay an excise tax on sales of certain medical devices under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act this excise tax is suspended from january 2016 until january 2018 medicare also implemented a competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies additionally the protecting access to medicare act establishes a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests which goes into effect in 2017 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain patient health information is increasing for example the european union continues to contemplate enacting stricter laws with enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance similarly the us department of health and human services has issued rules governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information and the us food and drug administration has issued further guidance concerning data security for medical devices failure to comply with data privacy and security regulations can result in enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties transferring and managing protected health information will become more challenging as new laws and regulations are enacted and with actions like the 2015 invalidation of the longstanding safe harbor mechanism for transfer of data from the european union to the united states abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area 

governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbotts nutrition business in the united states for example under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program 

abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the marketing manufacture availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

international operations 

as discussed in greater detail in the section captioned narrative description of business abbott markets products worldwide through affiliates and distributors most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the united states in addition certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the united states international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbotts securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbotts actual results abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned regulation to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns many of abbotts facilities and procedures and those of abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbotts products and criminal prosecution 

these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbotts business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbotts facilities while abbott or abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbotts industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs in the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbotts business 

both in the us and internationally government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs or make adverse decisions relating to our products coverage or reimbursement all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of our products or the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

in the us a number of the provisions of the us patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 change access to health care products and services and establish new fees for the medical device industry future rulemaking could increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or require additional reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking 

for additional information concerning health care regulation see the discussion in regulation under item 1 business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbotts future revenues and operating income 

many of abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbotts intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbotts businesses could suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbotts intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property abbotts future revenues and operating income could be reduced litigation regarding abbotts patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned legal proceedings 

competitors intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbotts revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbotts products to become obsolete causing abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer 

new products and technological advances by abbotts competitors may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

abbotts products face intense competition from its competitors products competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbotts products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbotts business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause 

similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

significant safety concerns could arise for abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbotts products 

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits safety alerts or product recalls and other allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbotts business and reputation and on abbotts ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs including health care deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt including credit downgrades could increase abbotts collection risk where a significant amount of abbotts receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems 

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on abbotts results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which abbott relies makes them vulnerable to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks in addition third party hacking attempts may cause data relating to customers or abbotts proprietary information to be compromised 

abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns to any of the systems on which abbott relies and that could have a significant effect on abbotts business 

abbott may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation 

abbvie and abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of abbvie from abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward these arrangements could lead to disputes between abbott and abbvie over abbotts rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations the separation and distribution agreement also provides for among other things indemnification obligations designed to make abbvie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after abbvies separation from abbott as well as those obligations of abbott assumed by abbvie pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between abbott and abbvie and require abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to abbvie third parties could also seek to hold abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations the indemnity rights abbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect abbott even if abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification abbott may have to bear losses temporarily in addition abbotts indemnity obligations to abbvie may be significant these risks could negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

there could be significant liability if the distribution of abbvie common stock to abbott shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

abbott received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to the effect that among other things the separation and the distribution of abbvie qualifies as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the code in addition abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from abbott and abbvie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the receipt by abbott of the private letter ruling from the irs and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of abbott or abbvie after the separation if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes abbott and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities

over the last three years sales growth was driven primarily by the established pharmaceuticals nutritional and diagnostics businesses sales in emerging markets which represent nearly 50 percent of total company sales increased 171 percent in 2015 and 125 percent in 2014 excluding the impact of foreign exchange emerging markets include all countries except the united states western europe japan canada australia and new zealand over the last three years margin improvement was driven primarily by the nutritional diagnostics and vascular businesses abbott expanded its operating margin by 120 basis points in 2015 and 200 basis points in 2014 abbotts sales costs and financial position over the same period were impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to international currencies and a challenging economic and fiscal environment in several emerging economies 

in abbotts worldwide nutritional products business sales over the last three years were positively impacted by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets as well as by numerous new product introductions that leveraged abbotts strong brands at the same time manufacturing and distribution process changes lower commodity costs and other cost reductions drove margin improvements across the business operating margins for this business increased from 187 percent in 2013 to 250 percent in 2015 

in 2014 abbott increased the local presence of its nutrition business in various countries by investing in its global infrastructure abbott opened three new manufacturing plants one in china one in india and one in the united states to meet the demand for its products and formed a strategic alliance with fonterra the worlds largest dairy cooperative to develop a proposed dairy farm hub in china

improvement continued to be a key focus in 2015 operating margins increased from 222 percent of sales in 2013 to 252 percent in 2015 as the business continued to execute on efficiency initiatives in the manufacturing and supply chain functions 

the established pharmaceutical products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets after the sale of its developed markets business to mylan on february 27 2015 the acquisition of cfr pharmaceuticals sa cfr in september 2014 more than doubled abbotts branded generics pharmaceutical presence in latin america and further expanded its presence in emerging markets through the acquisition of veropharm a leading russian pharmaceutical company in december 2014 abbott established a manufacturing footprint in russia and obtained a portfolio of medicines that is well aligned with abbotts current pharmaceutical therapeutic areas of focus excluding the impact of foreign exchange established pharmaceutical sales from continuing operations increased 341 percent in 2015 and 149 percent in 2014 excluding the impact of the 2014 acquisitions as well as the impact of foreign exchange 2015 established pharmaceutical sales from continuing operations increased 134 percent

on january 30 2016 abbott entered into a definitive agreement to acquire alere inc alere with annual sales of approximately 25 billion alere is a global leader in point of care diagnostics the acquisition which is expected to significantly advance abbotts global diagnostics presence and leadership is subject to the approval of alere shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including applicable regulatory approvals under the terms of the agreement abbott will pay 56 per common share at a total expected equity value of 58 billion aleres net debt currently 26 billion will be assumed or refinanced by abbott in february 2016 abbott obtained a commitment for a 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility for an amount not to exceed 9 billion in conjunction with its pending acquisition of alere while abbott plans to use cash on hand at the time of the acquisition from anticipated longterm borrowings to acquire alere the bridge facility will provide backup financing 

abbotts short and longterm debt totaled 90 billion at december 31 2015 at december 31 2015 abbotts longterm debt rating was a by standard and poors corporation and a2 by moodys investors service as a result of the pending acquisition of alere abbotts credit ratings are under review and it is anticipated that the ratings will be adjusted to reflect the increased borrowings that will be incurred to finance the acquisition in march 2015 abbott issued 25 billion of longterm debt consisting of 750 million that matures in 2020 750 million in 2022 and 10 billion in 2025 with fixed interest rates of 20 percent 255 percent and 295 percent respectively abbott also entered into interest rate swap contracts totaling 25 billion related to the debt issuance these contracts have the effect of changing abbotts obligation from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate obligation in the fourth quarter of 2014 abbott extinguished approximately 500 million of longterm debt that was assumed as part of the acquisition of cfr and incurred a charge of 183 million related to the early repayment of this debt

critical accounting policies 

sales rebates — in 2015 approximately 42 percent of abbotts consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances in 2015 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care segments abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 amounted to approximately 22 billion 21 billion and 19 billion respectively or 216 percent 201 percent and 191 percent respectively based on gross sales of approximately 103 billion 103 billion and 102 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 101 million in 2015 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 124 million 138 million and 146 million for cash discounts in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively and 238 million 210 million and 208 million for returns in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbotts historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management has access to several large customers inventory management data and for other customers utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data in addition internal processing time is a factor in 

estimating the accrual in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the states and internally administered market research the usda has been making its data available for many years internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data at december 31 2015 abbott had wic business in 26 states 

historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items is often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbotts federal income tax returns through 2011 are settled except for one item and the income tax returns for years after 2011 are open abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for decades can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2015 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 29 billion and 70 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent 

valuation experts who review abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december 31 2015 goodwill amounted to 96 billion and intangibles amounted to 56 billion and amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to 601 million in 2015 555 million in 2014 and 588 million in 2013 there were no impairments of goodwill in 2015 2014 or 2013 

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 450 contingencies under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 35 million to 50 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 45 million have been recorded at december 31 2015 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent managements best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 contingencies

the increases in total net sales in 2015 and 2014 reflect unit growth partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange the price declines related to vascular products sales in 2015 and 2014 primarily reflect pricing pressure on drug eluting stents and other coronary products as a result of market competition in the us and other major markets the impact of reimbursement reductions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services on abbotts diabetes care business also contributed to the overall 39 price decline in the us in 2014

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange total nutritional products sales increased 55 percent in 2015 and 50 percent in 2014 in abbotts international pediatric nutritional business the 2015 increase in sales was driven by growth in china russia and several countries in latin america and the middle east as a result of share gains and market growth the increase in 2015 us pediatric nutritional sales primarily reflects higher infant formula revenue from new product launches 

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange the 2015 and 2014 increases in international adult nutritional sales are due primarily to volume growth in emerging markets and continued expansion of the adult nutrition category internationally the decrease in 2015 and 2014 us adult nutritional sales reflects the effects of increased competition and market dynamics in retail and institutional categories 

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange total diagnostic products sales increased 73 percent in 2015 and 64 percent in 2014 the sales increases were primarily driven by share gains in the core laboratory markets in the us and internationally 2015 and 2014 sales of immunochemistry products the largest category in this segment reflect continued execution of abbotts strategy to deliver integrated solutions to large healthcare customers 

excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange total vascular products sales grew 13 in 2015 and were virtually flat in 2014 in 2015 growth of abbotts mitraclip structural heart product its endovascular business including the supera peripheral stent and the absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold in various international markets was almost entirely offset by continued pricing pressures in des products 

abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were not significant in 2015 2014 and 2013 

the expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to affect abbott 

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 542 percent of net sales in 2015 517 percent in 2014 and 502 percent in 2013 the gross profit margin improvement in 2015 reflects higher margins in the nutritional diagnostics and vascular products segments 

in the us states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products in numerous countries these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional and established pharmaceutical products segments 

research and development expense was 1405 billion in 2015 1345 billion in 2014 and 1371 billion in 2013 and represented a 45 percent increase in 2015 and a 19 percent decrease in 2014 the 2015 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending across various businesses in 2015 research and development expenditures totaled 474 million for the 

diagnostics products segment 239 million for the vascular products segment 206 million for the nutritional products segment and 137 million for the established pharmaceutical products segment 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 39 percent in 2015 and 25 percent in 2014 versus the respective prior year the 2015 increase reflects the impact of the cfr and veropharm acquisitions partially offset by the impact of cost improvement initiatives and the favorable impact of foreign exchange the 2014 increase reflects an increase in restructuring costs associated with cost reduction initiatives and deal and other expenses related to recent acquisitions partially offset by continued prudent cost management

discontinued operations and separation of abbvie inc 

on february 27 2015 abbott completed the sale of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to mylan inc mylan for equity ownership of a newly formed entity mylan nv that combined mylans existing business and abbotts developed markets pharmaceuticals business mylan nv is publicly traded historically this business was included in abbotts established pharmaceutical products segment at the date of the closing the 110 million mylan nv shares that abbott received were valued at 577 billion and abbott recorded an after tax gain on the sale of the business of approximately 16 billion abbott retained its branded generics pharmaceuticals business in emerging markets at the close of this transaction abbott and mylan entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which abbott and mylan are providing various back office support services to each other on an interim transitional basis transition services may be provided for up to 2 years charges by abbott under this transition services agreement are recorded as a reduction of the costs to provide the respective service in the applicable expense category in the consolidated statement of earnings this transitional support does not constitute significant continuing involvement in mylans operations abbott also entered into manufacturing supply agreements with mylan related to certain products with the supply term ranging from 3 to 10 years and requiring a 2 year notice prior to termination the cash flows associated with these transition services and manufacturing supply agreements are not expected to be

research and development programs 

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical devices diagnostic and nutritional products in development 

research and development process 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segments existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity 

depending upon the product the phases of development may include 

• drug product development • phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceuticals brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api • phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients • phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use • phase iv and other postmarketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china 

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include 

• discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need • conceptfeasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility • development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fdas premarketing approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a biological license application bla 

in the eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which is governed by the european invitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive other products only require a selfcertification process 

in the vascular segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design completion of clinical trials to test the products safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications 

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us vascular products are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbotts vascular products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 

in the eu vascular products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which is governed by the european medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 

after approval and commercial launch of some vascular products postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants athletes or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a products efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted 

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fdas confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutrition products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products 

areas of focus 

in 2016 and beyond abbotts significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following 

established pharmaceuticals — abbott focuses on building country specific portfolios made up of global and local pharmaceutical brands that best meet the needs of patients in each country more than 300 branded generic development projects are active for one or several emerging markets over the next several years established pharmaceuticals plans to expand its product portfolio in its key markets through the development and launch of new branded generics with the aim to be among the first to market with a new branded generic for a particular pharmaceutical product further geographic expansion of existing brands new product enhancements and strategic licensing activities abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as creon duphaston and influvac depending on the product the development activities focus on new data markets formulations combinations or indications 

vascular — ongoing projects in the pipeline include 

• absorb  the worlds first drug eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold bvs device for the treatment of coronary artery disease that is gradually resorbed into the vessel wall absorb gt1 received ce approval and was launched in the second quarter of 2015 abbott filed for regulatory approval in the us and japan in the second quarter of 2015 in 2015 abbott also released clinical results which demonstrated similarity to the xience metallic drugeluting stent des at one year through randomized noninferiority studies abbott is also actively working on the development of future generations of bvs technologies • mitraclip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation mr mitraclip is available in the us europe parts of asia the middle east and latin america for patients who are at prohibitive risk for mitral valve surgery abbott continued clinical development of the mitraclip therapy including the coapt trial a prospective randomized trial in the united states that will evaluate the impact of mitraclip treatment for an expanded indication in addition abbott continues to work on the development of next generation systems for the treatment of mr • supera selfexpanding nitinol stent system which was acquired as part of the acquisition of idev technologies in august 2013 with its proprietary interwoven wire technology supera is designed based on biomimetic principles to mimic the bodys natural movement supera is available in the us europe and various countries in asia the middle east and latin america for the treatment of blockages in blood vessels due to peripheral artery disease with expanded size matrix approved in the us abbott is developing supera s next generation delivery system • abbott is also developing future versions of metallic des guide wires and balloon delivery catheters armada 18  abbotts new peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter for the treatment of challenging cases in the superficial femoral artery and below the knee categories received ce approval and was launched in the third quarter of 2015 medical optics — abbott is developing a number of new products which are designed to enhance surgical efficiency andor improve visual outcomes for patients undergoing cataract and lasik surgery in 2015 abbott launched the tecnis® monofocal 1piece intraocular lens iol with the tecnis itec preloaded delivery system in the us the tecnis itec preloaded delivery system is designed to provide 

an additional level of safety and surgical efficiency to the outcomes already provided by the tecnis® monofocal 1piece iol the tecnis® multifocal low add products were launched in the us and provide surgeons the ability to customize treatment based on the patients vision needs and lifestyle the whitestar signature ® pro phacoemulsification system for removal of cataracts was approved and launched in the us this system includes a first of its kind application designed for ipad® mobile digital devices that gives surgeons the opportunity to download and analyze data to improve surgical efficiency the idesign® advanced wavescan studio system was launched in the us and china this system provides a highdefinition scan of the eye that can be used to create a personalized lasik treatment plan based on the unique blueprint of each persons eyes 

in 2016 abbott will continue to develop next generation equipment and consumables including improvements to the lasik platform with upgrades to its idesign system and a new eximer laser as well as upgrades to the catalys laser cataract surgery system abbott will seek approval to launch existing products into new markets to better leverage its product portfolio 

molecular diagnostics — various new molecular in vitro diagnostic ivd products and next generation instrument systems are in various stages of development and commercialization abbotts companion diagnostic program includes collaborative efforts with multiple major pharmaceutical companies 

core laboratory diagnostics — abbott is working on the development of nextgeneration blood screening hematology and immunochemistry instrument systems as well as assays in various areas including infectious disease cardiac care metabolics oncology and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories 

diabetes care — in 2015 abbott completed its clinical outcome trial replace for its freestyle libre flash glucose monitoring system in people with type 2 diabetes the system eliminates the need for routine finger pricks by reading glucose levels through a sensor that can be worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days the freestyle libre system also requires no finger pricks for calibration in 2014 abbott received ce mark in europe for the freestyle libre system and in 2015 it also received ce mark for an indication for children and young people with diabetes ages 417 years old freestyle libre pro which is designed to be used by healthcare professionals in a clinic setting was launched to patients in india and the pma for freestyle libre pro was submitted in the us 

nutrition — abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric adult and performance nutrition areas gastro intestinal health brain health mobility and metabolism and user experience platforms numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development including clinical outcome testing and are expected to be launched over the coming years 

given the diversity of abbotts business its intention to remain a broadbased healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbotts overall market position there were no delays in abbotts 2015 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbotts ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical medical device and diagnostic products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each 

year abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period 

goodwill 

at december 31 2015 goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled 96 billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the medical optics unit goodwill related to the medical optics unit totals approximately 2 billion while the fair value of the medical optics unit exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15 various factors could develop and result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the medical optics unit has declined below its carrying value thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment these factors include a lower than projected growth rate for the business longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development and the negative impact of foreign currency movements as well as an increase in the discount rate used in the quantitative assessment 

financial condition 

cash flow 

net cash from operating activities amounted to 30 billion 37 billion and 33 billion in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2015 was due in large part to the divestiture of the developed market established pharmaceuticals business in february 2015 as well as an increase in contributions to defined benefit plans in 2015 the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2014 was due to an improvement in operating results as well as lower cash contributions to pension plans net cash from operating activities in 2013 reflects approximately 435 million of onetime net cash outflows related to the separation of abbvie and 724 million of contributions to defined benefit pension plans the income tax component of operating cash flow in 2015 2014 and 2013 includes 70 million 268 million and 427 million respectively of noncash tax benefits primarily related to the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years 2015 reflects the noncash impact of approximately 11 billion of tax expense associated with the gain on sale of businesses and 2013 also includes a 103 million tax benefit for the retroactive impact of us tax law changes which is expected to be realized in future years 

while over 85 of the cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 is considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott may be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbott believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2015 can be considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

abbott funded 579 million in 2015 393 million in 2014 and 724 million in 2013 to defined benefit pension plans abbott expects pension funding of approximately 576 million in 2016 for its pension plans of which approximately 470 million relates to its main domestic pension plans abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends 

debt and capital 

at december 31 2015 abbotts longterm debt rating was a by standard  poors corporation and a2 by moodys investors service as a result of the pending acquisition of alere abbotts credit ratings 

are under review and it is anticipated that the ratings will be adjusted to reflect the increased borrowings that will be incurred to finance the acquisition abbott has readily available financial resources including unused lines of credit of 50 billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements which expire in 2019 

in march 2015 abbott issued 25 billion of longterm debt that matures in 2020 2022 and 2025 with fixed interest rates of 20 percent 255 percent and 295 percent respectively proceeds from this debt were used to pay down shortterm borrowings abbott also entered into interest rate swap contracts totaling 25 billion these contracts have the effect of changing abbotts obligation from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate obligation 

in 2014 abbott redeemed approximately 500 million of longterm notes that were assumed as part of the acquisition of cfr pharmaceuticals 

in september 2014 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 30 billion of abbotts common shares from time to time the 2014 authorization was in addition to the 512 million unused portion of a previous program announced in june 2013 in 2015 abbott repurchased 113 million shares at a cost of 512 million under the unused portion of the 2013 authorization and 362 million shares at a cost of 17 billion under the program authorized in 2014 for a total of 475 million shares at a cost of 22 billion in 2014 abbott repurchased 546 million shares at a cost of 21 billion under the program announced in june 2013 in 2013 abbott repurchased 105 million shares at a cost of 388 million under the 2013 authorization and 330 million shares at a cost of 12 billion under a previous authorization for a total of 435 million shares at a cost of 16 billion 

abbott declared dividends of 098 per share in 2015 compared to 090 per share in 2014 a 9 increase dividends paid were 1443 billion in 2015 compared to 1342 billion in 2014 the yearoveryear change in dividends reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate 

working capital 

the increase of cash and cash equivalents from 41 billion at december 31 2014 to 50 billion at december 31 2015 reflects the cash generated by operating activities as well as the proceeds from the sale of investment securities working capital was 50 billion at december 31 2015 and 31 billion at december 31 2014 the increase in working capital in 2015 was due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and a decrease in shortterm borrowings primarily due to the proceeds received related to the recent divestiture of businesses and the issuance of longterm debt 

substantially all of abbotts trade receivables in italy spain portugal and greece are with governmental health systems the collection of outstanding receivables in these countries improved in 2014 and has been stable in 2015 governmental receivables in these four countries accounted for less than 1 percent of abbotts total assets and 7 percent of total net trade receivables as of december 31 2015 down from 9 percent as of december 31 2014 

with the exception of greece abbott historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries abbott continues to monitor the credit worthiness of customers located in these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected in addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments in these countries abbott regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbott also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbott may not be able to collect the entire balance 

venezuela operations 

since january 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap in 2014 and 2015 the government of venezuela operated multiple mechanisms to exchange bolivars into us dollars these mechanisms included the cencoex sicad and simadi rates which stood at 63 135 and approximately 200 respectively at december 31 2015 in 2015 abbott continued to use the cencoex rate of 63 venezuelan bolivars to the us dollar to report the results financial position and cash flows related to its operations in venezuela since abbott continued to qualify for this exchange rate to pay for the import of various products into venezuela 

revenue from operations in venezuela represented approximately 2 of abbotts total net sales and pretax income totaled approximately 200 million in 2015 and 175 million in 2014 abbotts sales in venezuela primarily relate to the nutritional and established pharmaceuticals segments the economic uncertainty associated with venezuela increased in 2015 due to the continued hyperinflation and political uncertainty in the country and lower oil prices among other factors abbott had net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation in venezuela of approximately 440 million at december 31 2015 such assets are comprised primarily of cash 

on february 17 2016 the venezuelan government announced that the threetier exchange rate system will be reduced to two rates and the official rate for food and medicine imports will be adjusted from 63 to 10 bolivars per us dollar as a result of the new 10 bolivars per us dollar exchange rate abbotts net monetary assets in venezuela will be subject to revaluation during the quarter ending march 31 2016 which will result in recognition of a foreign currency exchange loss in that period based on abbotts net monetary assets subject to revaluation at december 31 2015 remeasuring these assets at a rate of 10 bolivars per us dollar would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately 165 million 

abbott cannot be certain that the venezuelan government will not make further revisions to the official exchange rate in the future which could result in additional foreign currency losses while abbott intends to continue to sell medically critical products in this country abbott cannot predict the impact of continued hyperinflation low oil prices and the new exchange rate system on the venezuelan economy or on the future operating results and financial position of its business in this country 

capital expenditures

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 



a purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements b net unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately 600 million are excluded from the table above as abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items see note 14 — taxes on earnings from continuing operations for further details the company has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postemployment benefits including medical and life which have been excluded from the table a discussion of the companys pension and postretirement plans including funding matters is included in note 13 — postemployment benefits 

contingent obligations 

abbott has periodically entered into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business such as assignment of product rights which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these obligations based upon past experience the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote in addition abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events 

legislative issues 

abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors 

recently issued accounting standards 

in january 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201601 financial instruments — recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities which provides new guidance for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities the standard becomes effective for abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2018 and early adoption is permitted abbott is currently evaluating the effect if any that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  which requires entities to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet the standard may be adopted on either a prospective or retrospective basis the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted effective december 31 2015 abbott adopted asu 201517 and applied the new standard retrospectively as a result of applying asu 201517 to the previously reported consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014 deferred income taxes within the total current assets line decreased and the deferred income taxes and other assets line increased by approximately 17 billion respectively other accrued liabilities within the total current liabilities line decreased by 65 million and the postemployment obligations and other longterm liabilities line increased by 12 million reclassification of the deferred tax balances from current to noncurrent affected the netting of these balances as a deferred tax asset or liability in various jurisdictions 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  this asu which is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset early adoption is permitted and retrospective application is required effective december 31 2015 abbott adopted asu 201503 and the consolidated balance sheet was retrospectively adjusted to reflect the new presentation the adoption of asu 201503 did not have a material impact to abbotts consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and will supersede most existing revenue recognition guidance the standard becomes effective for abbott in the first quarter of 2018 abbott is currently evaluating the effect if any that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

financial instruments and risk management 

market price sensitive investments 

the fair value of the availableforsale equity securities held by abbott was approximately 38 billion and 9 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase is due primarily to the shares of mylan nv that abbott received in the sale of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business and that it continued to hold at december 31 2015 all availableforsale equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value a hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at december 31 2015 by approximately 750 million abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in fair value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in fair value occurs 

nonpublicly traded equity securities 

abbott holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges the carrying value of these investments was approximately 120 million and 100 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively no individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of 25 million abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated fair value occurs 

interest rate sensitive financial instruments 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 40 billion and 15 billion respectively to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged abbott does not use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities at december 31 2015 abbott had 27 billion of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 031 with an average remaining life of 27 days the fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2015 and 2014 amounted to 63 billion and 41 billion respectively average interest rates of 41 and 53 as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively with maturities through 2040 at december 31 2015 and 2014 the fair value of current and longterm investment securities amounted to approximately 52 billion and 626 million respectively a hypothetical 100basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows income or fair values a 100basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in rates 

foreign currency sensitive financial instruments 

certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are markedtomarket with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold generally within the next twelve to eighteen months at december 31 2015 and 2014 abbott held 24 billion and 15 billion respectively of such contracts contracts held at december 31 2015 will mature in 2016 or 2017 depending upon the contract contracts held at december 31 2014 matured in 2015 or will mature in 2016 depending upon the contract 

abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and thirdparty trade payables and 

receivables the contracts are markedtomarket and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed at december 31 2015 and 2014 abbott held 140 billion and 141 billion respectively of such contracts which generally mature in the next twelve months 

abbott has designated foreign denominated shortterm debt of approximately 439 million and approximately 445 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary accordingly changes in the fair value of this debt due to changes in exchange rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbotts business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott orders for abbotts products are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbotts business no material portion of abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government 

research and development 

abbott spent approximately 13 billion in 2014 14 billion in 2013 and 15 billion in 2012 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2014 were approximately 14 million and 37 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2015 are estimated to be 11 million and 40 million respectively 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency epa or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 77000 persons as of december 31 2014 

regulation 

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbotts products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbotts international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries these may require local investment restrict abbotts investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products in addition abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback 

and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbotts business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

abbotts business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbotts products for the foreseeable future 

in the united states the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical procedures in which medical devices and diagnostics may be used the government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbott must pay an excise tax on sales of certain medical devices medicare also implemented a competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain patient health information is increasing for example the european union continues to contemplate enacting stricter laws with enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance similarly the us department of 

health and human services has issued rules governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information and the us food and drug administration has issued further guidance concerning data security for medical devices failure to comply with data privacy and security regulations can result in enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties transferring and managing protected health information will become more challenging as new laws and regulations are enacted and abbott expects there will be increasing regulatory complexity in this area 

governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbotts nutrition business in the united states for example under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program 

abbott expects debate to continue during 2015 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing manufacture availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

international operations 

as discussed in greater detail in the section captioned narrative description of business abbott markets products worldwide through affiliates and distributors most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the united states in addition certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the united states international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbotts securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbotts actual results abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned regulation to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns many of abbotts facilities and procedures and those of abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbotts products and criminal prosecution these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbotts business practices 

and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbotts facilities while abbott or abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbotts industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs in the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbotts business 

a number of the provisions of the us patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 change access to health care products and services and establish new fees for the medical device industry future rulemaking could increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or require additional reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbotts future revenues and operating income 

many of abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbotts intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbotts businesses could suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbotts intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property abbotts future revenues and operating income could be reduced litigation regarding abbotts patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned legal proceedings 

competitors intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbotts revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbotts products to become obsolete causing abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer 

new products and technological advances by abbotts competitors may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

abbotts products face intense competition from its competitors products competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbotts products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbotts business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

significant safety concerns could arise for abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a 

product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbotts products 

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits safety alerts or product recalls and other allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbotts business and reputation and on abbotts ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs including health care deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt including credit downgrades could increase abbotts collection risk where a significant amount of abbotts receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems 

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on abbotts results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of abbotts information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption abbotts systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a significant effect on abbotts business 

abbott may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation 

abbvie and abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of abbvie from abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward these arrangements could lead to disputes between abbott and abbvie over abbotts rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations the separation and distribution agreement also provides for among other things indemnification obligations designed to make abbvie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after abbvies separation from abbott as well as those obligations of abbott assumed by abbvie pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between abbott and abbvie and require abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to abbvie third parties could also seek to hold abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations the indemnity rights abbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect abbott even if abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification abbott may have to bear losses temporarily in addition abbotts 

indemnity obligations to abbvie may be significant these risks could negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

there could be significant liability if the distribution of abbvie common stock to abbott shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

abbott received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to the effect that among other things the separation and the distribution of abbvie qualifies as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the code in addition abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from abbott and abbvie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the receipt by abbott of the private letter ruling from the irs and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of abbott or abbvie after the separation if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes abbott and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

abbott holds a significant investment in mylan nv and is subject to market risk 

on february 27 2015 abbott completed the disposition of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business and in exchange received 110000000 mylan nv ordinary shares as long as abbott holds the shares abbott will have a substantial undiversified equity investment in mylan and therefore will be subject to the risk of changes in the market value of those shares 

fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and abbotts ability to realize projected sales and earnings 

although abbotts financial statements are denominated in us dollars a significant portion of abbotts revenues and costs are realized in other currencies abbotts profitability is affected by movement of the us dollar against other currencies fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of abbotts assets and liabilities as well as its cash flows some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls while abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks 

the international nature of abbotts business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbotts business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally sales outside of the united states make up approximately 70 percent of abbotts net sales additional risks associated with abbotts international operations include 

• differing local product preferences and product requirements • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations 12 

• differing labor regulations • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws • political and economic instability including sovereign debt issues • price controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action • inflation recession and fluctuations in interest rates • compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anticorruption antibribery and other similar laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbotts profitability and its financial condition including 

• changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements product marketing application standards product labeling source and use laws and environmental laws • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value particularly for pensions retiree health care stock compensation intangibles and goodwill and for contingent liabilities such as litigation the absence of a recorded amount or an amount recorded at the minimum compared to the actual amount • changes in the rate of inflation including the cost of raw materials commodities and supplies interest rates market value of abbotts equity investments and the performance of investments held by abbott or abbotts employee benefit trusts • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to abbott or abbotts employee benefit trusts • changes in business economic and political conditions including war political instability terrorist attacks the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action natural disasters the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events labor disputes strikes slowdowns or other forms of labor or union activity and pressure from thirdparty interest groups • changes in abbotts business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies changing product mix changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the us and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future • changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor retailer or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions pricing seasonality or other factors or other problems with licensors suppliers distributors and business partners • changes in credit markets impacting abbotts ability to obtain financing for its business operations and • legal difficulties any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations and adverse litigation decisions 13

 item 3 legal proceedings 

abbott is involved in various claims legal proceedings and investigations including as of january 31 2015 except where noted below those described below while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims proceedings and investigations with certainty management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

in september 2009 wyeth cordis corporation and cordis llc filed suit against abbott in the united states district court for the district of new jersey alleging the xience v and later the xience prime stent systems infringe a patent relating to drug eluting stents and in august 2010 the plaintiffs amended their lawsuit to add a second related patent to this case the plaintiffs seek an injunction and damages in february 2012 the court stayed the litigation pending the completion of inter partes reexamination of the two patents at issue by the united states patent and trademark office and any resulting appeals 

in december 2008 medinol limited medinol sued abbott in germany asserting that certain of abbotts coronary bare metal and certain of its metalbased drug eluting stent products infringe four of medinols european and german stent design patents and in june 2011 asserted another related european patent against abbott in march 2010 a german court which assesses questions of patent infringement issued mixed infringementnoninfringement rulings which both abbott and medinol appealed the infringement cases were stayed pending further developments with respect to abbottinitiated actions relating to patent validity in january 2011 a different german court which assesses questions of patent validity found two of three of the medinol patents invalid but concluded that the modified claims of one of medinols german patents were valid the validity of these three patents was appealed to the german federal supreme court which upheld the patents validity in april 2014 the previously stayed infringement actions related to these three patents are scheduled for april and may 2015 the question of the validity of the remaining patents are subject to continued lower court proceedings in each case medinol seeks damages these cases are no longer material to abbott and abbott will no longer report on these cases 

as previously mentioned the texas state attorney general is investigating the sales and marketing activities of abbotts biliary stent products and the united states attorneys office for the district of maryland is investigating the sales and marketing activities for abbotts coronary stents products the government is seeking to determine whether any of these activities violated civil andor criminal laws including the federal false claims act the food and drug cosmetic act and the antikickback statute in connection with medicare andor medicaid reimbursement paid to third parties

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial review 

abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbotts products under a contract most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs abbotts primary products are nutritional products branded generic pharmaceuticals diagnostic testing products and vascular products sales in international markets comprise approximately 70 percent of consolidated net sales 

in july 2014 abbott announced that it will sell its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to mylan inc mylan for 110 million shares of a newly formed publically traded entity that will combine mylans existing business and abbotts developed markets pharmaceuticals business the sale of this business closed on february 27 2015 in november 2014 abbott entered into an agreement to sell its animal health business to zoetis inc the sale of this business closed on february 10 2015 on january 1 2013 abbott completed the separation of abbvie inc abbvie which was formed to hold abbotts researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business the historical operating results of these businesses prior to disposition are excluded from earnings from continuing operations and are presented on the earnings from discontinued operations line in abbotts consolidated statement of earnings any assets or liabilities related to these businesses are being reported as held for sale in abbotts consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2014 the cash flows of these businesses up through the date of disposition or separation are included in its consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented 

over the last three years sales growth and margin improvement was driven primarily by the nutritional and diagnostics businesses sales in emerging markets which represent nearly 50 percent of total company sales increased 125 percent in 2014 and 108 percent in 2013 excluding the impact of foreign exchange emerging markets include all countries except the united states western europe japan canada australia and new zealand abbott expanded its operating margin by 200 basis points in 2014 and 380 basis points in 2013 abbotts sales costs and financial position over the same period were impacted by a challenging economic and fiscal environment in several emerging economies and the strengthening of the us dollar relative to several international currencies during 2013 and 2014 

in abbotts worldwide nutritional products business sales over the last three years were positively impacted by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets as well as by numerous new product introductions that leveraged abbotts strong brands at the same time manufacturing and distribution process changes and other cost reductions drove margin improvements across the business operating margins for this business increased from 157 percent in 2012 to 210 percent in 2014 

in the second half of 2013 and the first two quarters of 2014 sales growth in international pediatric nutrition was affected by a product recall initiated in august 2013 in china and two other markets for certain pediatric nutritional products supplied to abbott by a thirdparty manufacturer while there were no health issues associated with the recalled products and the supplier subsequently determined that the products had been safe for consumption the recall created significant disruption in these markets as a result international pediatric nutrition sales were significantly lower than abbotts previous expectations for this business for the second half of 2013 abbott initiated investments in the third quarter of 2013 in these markets to rebuild consumer confidence and this business had recovered from this disruption by the beginning of the third quarter of 2014 

in 2014 abbott increased the local presence of its nutrition business in various countries by investing in its global infrastructure abbott opened three new manufacturing plants one in china one in india and one in the united states to meet the demand for its products and formed a strategic alliance with fonterra the worlds largest dairy cooperative to develop a proposed dairy farm hub in china 

in abbotts worldwide diagnostics business margin improvement continued to be a key focus in 2014 operating margins increased from 192 percent of sales in 2012 to 229 percent in 2014 as the business continued to execute on efficiency initiatives in the manufacturing and supply chain functions in addition to continued margin improvement unit growth across geographical regions positively impacted worldwide diagnostic sales worldwide sales for this business increased 64 percent in 2014 and 83 percent in 2013 excluding foreign exchange 

in the established pharmaceutical products segment abbott announced in july 2014 that it will sell its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to mylan inc as a result the current and prior year operating results of the developed markets branded generics business are reported as part of discontinued operations following the close of this transaction the established pharmaceuticals business will operate entirely in emerging markets on september 26 2014 abbott completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in cfr pharmaceuticals sa cfr the acquisition of cfr more than doubles abbotts branded generics pharmaceutical presence in latin america and further expands its presence in emerging markets on december 12 2014 abbott acquired control of veropharm a leading russian pharmaceutical company through this acquisition abbott establishes a manufacturing footprint in russia and obtains a portfolio of medicines that is well aligned with abbotts current pharmaceutical therapeutic areas of focus 

the growth in established pharmaceuticals sales from continuing operations accelerated over the course of 2014 after macroeconomic and market pressures in certain emerging markets impacted this business in 2013 for the year in total 2014 sales increased 149 percent excluding the effect of foreign exchange 

in the vascular business over the last three years abbott has continued to develop its worldwide marketleading xience drugeluting stent des franchise the xience franchise includes xience v prime nano pro prox xpedition  and alpine abbott vascular products latest product introduction xience alpine  was launched in the us late in the fourth quarter of 2014 and is the only product on the market in the us with an indication to treat chronic total inclusions cto the xience franchise maintained its marketleading global position in 2014 in 2014 and 2013 while mitraclip absorb and the endovascular franchise contributed to sales growth total vascular sales were flat excluding the unfavorable effect of exchange as volume increases were almost entirely offset by pricing pressures primarily related to des and other coronary products as well as lower des market share in the us operating margins improved from 332 percent in 2012 to 365 percent in 2014 as cost improvement initiatives were executed across the business 

abbotts short and longterm debt totaled 78 billion at december 31 2014 at december 31 2014 abbotts longterm debt rating was a by standard and poors corporation and a1 by moodys investors service in the fourth quarter of 2014 abbott extinguished approximately 500 million of longterm debt that was assumed as part of the acquisition of cfr and incurred a charge of 183 million related to the early repayment of this debt in the fourth quarter of 2012 abbott extinguished 77 billion of longterm debt and incurred a charge of 135 billion related to the early repayment net of gains from the unwinding of interest rate swaps related to the debt

critical accounting policies 

sales rebates — in 2014 approximately 43 percent of abbotts consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances in 2014 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care segments abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 amounted to approximately 21 billion 19 billion and 18 billion respectively or 192 percent 184 percent and 183 percent respectively based on gross sales of approximately 107 billion 105 billion and 98 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 107 million in 2014 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 138 million 146 million and 144 million for cash discounts in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively and 210 million 208 million and 198 million for returns in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbotts historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management has access to several large customers inventory management data and for other customers utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data in addition internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business external data sources utilized for that estimate 

are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the states and internally administered market research the usda has been making its data available for many years internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data at december 31 2014 abbott had wic business in 23 states 

historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items are often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbotts federal income tax returns through 2011 are settled except for four items and the income tax returns for years after 2011 are open abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for decades can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2014 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 32 billion and 161 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than 

the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december 31 2014 goodwill amounted to 101 billion and intangibles amounted to 62 billion and amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to 555 million in 2014 588 million in 2013 and 595 million in 2012 there were no impairments of goodwill in 2014 2013 or 2012 in 2012 abbott recorded impairment charges of 69 million for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects 

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 450 contingencies under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 70 million to 85 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 80 million have been recorded at december 31 2014 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent managements best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 contingencies 

results of operations 

sales

the increases in total net sales in 2014 and 2013 reflect unit growth partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange the price declines related to vascular products sales in 2014 and 2013 primarily reflect pricing pressure on drug eluting stents and other coronary products as a result of market competition in the us and other major markets the impact of reimbursement reductions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services on abbotts diabetes care business also contributed to the overall 39 price decline in the us in 2014 

a comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers

excluding the unfavorable effect of exchange total nutritional products sales increased 50 percent in 2014 and 54 percent in 2013 international pediatric nutritional sales increased in 2014 and 2013 due primarily to volume growth in developing countries a suppliers recall of product in august 2013 in certain international markets negatively impacted international pediatric nutritional sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 as well as the first two quarters of 2014 while there were no health issues associated with this supplier recall and the supplier subsequently determined that the product had been safe for consumption this event created significant disruption in these markets the decline in 2014 us pediatric nutritional sales primarily reflects lower infant formula revenue us pediatric sales were flat in 2013 due to lower formula share partially offset by higher sales of toddler products 

the 2014 and 2013 increases in international adult nutritional sales are due primarily to volume growth in developing countries and were negatively impacted by the effect of the relatively stronger us dollar the decrease in 2014 us adult nutritional sales reflects a decline in performance nutrition as well as weakness in the institutional market segment the 31 percent decline in 2013 us adult nutritional sales reflects abbotts exit from certain noncore business lines as part of the business margin improvement initiative most of the sales decline resulting from this exit was offset by higher ensure revenues

abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were not significant in 2014 2013 and 2012 

the expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to affect abbott 

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 517 percent of net sales in 2014 502 percent in 2013 and 502 percent in 2012 the gross profit margin improvement in 2014 reflects higher margins in the nutritional diagnostics and vascular products segments the gross profit margin in 2013 remained relatively unchanged versus the 

prior year as improved margins in the nutritional and diagnostics products segments were offset by margin declines in established pharmaceuticals and vascular products due to pricing pressures and product mix as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange across segments 

in the us states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products in numerous countries these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional and established pharmaceutical products segments

selling general and administrative expenses increased 25 percent in 2014 and decreased 54 percent in 2013 versus the respective prior year the 2014 increase reflects an increase in restructuring costs associated with cost reduction initiatives and deal and other expenses related to recent acquisitions partially offset by continued prudent cost management the 2013 decrease reflects the transfer of certain 2012 corporate costs to abbvie in the separation as well as certain information technology and other back office support costs that were charged to abbvie in 2013 under transition services agreements prudent cost management and a reduction in restructuring costs also contributed to the decrease

discontinued operations and separation of abbvie inc 

on november 28 2012 abbotts board of directors declared a special dividend distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of abbvie inc abbvie the company formed to hold abbotts researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business for each abbott common share held at the close of business on december 12 2012 abbott shareholders received one share of abbvie stock on january 1 2013 abbott has received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the separation qualifies as a taxfree distribution to abbott and its us shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

the historical operating results of the researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business prior to separation are excluded from earnings from continuing operations and are presented on the earnings from discontinued operations line discontinued operations include the results of abbvies business except for certain corporate overhead costs and certain costs associated with transition services that will be provided by abbott to abbvie discontinued operations also include other costs incurred by abbott to separate abbvie as well as an allocation of interest assuming a uniform ratio of consolidated debt to equity for all of abbotts historical operations the assets liabilities and cash flows of the researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business are included in abbotts consolidated balance sheet and its consolidated statements of cash flows for periods prior to january 1 2013

for a small portion of abbvies operations the legal transfer of abbvies assets net of liabilities did not occur with the separation of abbvie on january 1 2013 due to the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and other regulatory requirements in each of these countries under the terms of the separation agreement with abbott abbvie is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets the majority of these operations were transferred to abbvie in 2013 and 2014 with the remainder expected to be transferred in 2015 these assets and liabilities have been presented as held for disposition in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2014 the assets and liabilities held for disposition consist of trade accounts receivable of 79 million inventories of 45 million equipment of 3 million other assets of 30 million trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 277 million abbotts obligation to transfer the net liabilities held for disposition to abbvie of 120 million is included in other prepaid assets

the operating results of abbotts developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals and animal health businesses and as well as the businesses transferred to abbvie noted above which are being reported as discontinued operations are as follows 



the yearoveryear decline in net sales related to the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business was driven primarily by the impact of declining prices and the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

research and development programs 

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical devices diagnostic and nutritional products in development 

research and development process 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segments existing products to provide benefits to patients 

and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity 

depending upon the product the phases of development may include 

• drug product development • phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceuticals brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api • phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients • phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use • phase iv and other postmarketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china 

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include 

• discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need • conceptfeasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility • development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fdas premarketing approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a biological license application bla 

in the eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which is governed by the european invitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive other products only require a selfcertification process 

in the vascular segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design completion of clinical trials to test the products safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications 

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us vascular products are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbotts vascular products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 

in the eu vascular products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which is governed by the european medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 

after approval and commercial launch of some vascular products postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants athletes or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a products efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted 

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fdas confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutrition products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products 

areas of focus 

in 2015 and beyond abbotts significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following 

established pharmaceuticals — abbott focuses on building country specific portfolios made up of global and local pharmaceutical brands that best meet the needs of patients in each country more than 300 branded generic development projects are active for one or several emerging markets over the next several years established pharmaceuticals plans to expand its product portfolio in its key markets through the development and launch of new branded generics with the aim to be among the first to market with a new branded generic for a particular pharmaceutical product further geographic expansion of existing brands new product enhancements and strategic licensing activities abbott is also actively working on development plans for several key brands such as creon duphaston and influvac depending on the product the development activities focus on new data markets formulations combinations or indications 

vascular — ongoing projects in the pipeline include 

• xience alpine  our newest drugeluting stent des received us fda approval in september 2014 and is the only des with an indication for chronic total occlusions ctos  xience alpine was also approved for sale in europe japan and parts of latin america in 2014 • absorb  the worlds first drug eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold bvs device for the treatment of coronary artery disease that is gradually resorbed into the vessel wall in 2014 abbott completed enrollment of patients in clinical trials for regulatory approval in the us and china and enrollment for trials in japan was completed in the fourth quarter of 2013 abbott initiated a trial with the objective of demonstrating that absorb is more costeffective and provides the patient a higher 38 

quality of life than a permanent metallic drug eluting stent abbott is also actively working on the development of future generations of bvs technologies 

• mitraclip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation mr mitraclip is available in the us europe parts of asia the middle east and latin america for patients with significant symptomatic degenerative mr who are at prohibitive risk for mitral valve surgery abbott continued clinical development of the mitraclip therapy including the coapt trial a prospective randomized trial in the united states that will evaluate the impact of mitraclip treatment on the progression of heart failure in addition abbott continues to work on the development of the next generation system for the treatment of mr • supera selfexpanding nitinol stent system which was acquired as part of the acquisition of idev technologies in august 2013 with its proprietary interwoven wire technology supera is designed based on biomimetic principles to mimic the bodys natural movement supera received us fda approval in march 2014 for treatment of the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries which are the main arteries in the thigh that supply blood to lower extremities supera is also available in europe parts of asia the middle east and latin america for the treatment of blockages in blood vessels due to peripheral artery disease pad abbott continues to work on the development of supera s size matrix and next generation delivery system • coronary and endovascular guide wires abbotts versaturn guide wire received ce regulatory approval in july 2014 and 510k clearance in the us in august 2014 medical optics — abbott is developing a number of new products which are designed to improve patient outcomes for patients undergoing cataract and lasik surgery in 2014 abbott launched the tecnis® symfony intraocular lens iol in europe tecnis® symfony provides an extended continuous range of highquality vision including distance intermediate and near vision with visual side effects similar to a standard monofocal iol a toric version of tecnis® symfony that corrects a patients astigmatism was approved and launched in europe in late 2014 abbott received approval for two new tecnis® multifocal low add products in the us the new tecnis® multifocal iols allow the surgeon to customize treatment based on the patients vision needs and lifestyle the tecnis® optiblue toric iol was approved in japan in both standard and preloaded options for treatment of cataract patients with astigmatism the compact intuitiv phacoemulsification system for removing cataract was approved in the us and europe abbott received approval in the us and europe for cos 30 a new software upgrade and loi12 a new disposable patient interface for its catalys precision femtosecond laser cataract system that together improve surgeon efficiency 

in 2015 abbott will continue to work to develop and introduce new products including the tecnis1 monofocal iol in a preloaded insertion system an upgrade to its signature phacoemulsification system for cataract removal an upgrade to its catalys laser cataract system that helps surgeons to identify a cataract patients axis of astigmatism and idesign its advanced vision diagnostic and lasik treatment planning system 

molecular diagnostics — various new molecular in vitro diagnostic ivd products and next generation instrument systems are in various stages of development and commercialization in december 2014 iridica  an instrument used to rapidly identify a broad range of infection causing pathogens including bacteria fungi and viruses in critically ill patients became available in europe and other cemark recognized countries abbotts companion diagnostic program continues to expand and includes collaborative efforts with multiple major pharmaceutical companies 

core laboratory diagnostics — abbott is working on the development of nextgeneration blood screening hematology and immunochemistry instrument systems as well as assays in various areas including infectious disease cardiac care metabolics oncology and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories 

diabetes care — in the third quarter of 2014 abbott received ce mark in europe for its freestyle libre flash glucose monitoring system the system eliminates the need for routine finger pricks by reading glucose levels through a sensor that can be worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days the freestyle libre system also requires no finger pricks for calibration 

nutrition — abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six platforms that span the pediatric adult and performance nutrition areas immunity cognition lean body mass inflammation metabolism and tolerance numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development including clinical outcome testing and are expected to be launched over the coming years 

given the diversity of abbotts business its intention to remain a broadbased healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbotts overall market position there were no delays in abbotts 2014 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbotts ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical medical device and diagnostic products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each year abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period 

goodwill 

at december 31 2014 goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled 101 billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the medical optics unit while the fair value of the medical optics business exceeds its carrying value extended economic pressure on governmentreimbursed cataract procedures in europe and on the global lasik surgery business as well as longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development the integration of optimedica and the negative impact of foreign currency movements could result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the medical optics unit has declined below its carrying value thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment 

financial condition 

cash flow 

net cash from operating activities amounted to 37 billion 33 billion and 93 billion in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2014 was due to an improvement in operating results as well as lower cash contributions to pension plans the decrease in cash from operating activities from 2012 to 2013 was due to the separation of abbvie on january 1 2013 net cash from operating activities in 2013 reflects approximately 435 million of onetime net cash outflows related to the separation of abbvie and 724 million of contributions to defined benefit pension plans the income tax component of operating cash flow in 2014 2013 and 2012 includes 268 million 427 million and 408 million respectively of noncash tax benefits primarily related to the favorable 

resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years and 2013 also includes a 103 million tax benefit for the retroactive impact of us tax law changes which is expected to be realized in future years trade accounts payable and other liabilities in net cash from operating activities in 2012 includes the payment of approximately 15 billion related to a litigation accrual recorded in 2011 related to the business operations of abbvie this was partially offset by increases in other liabilities primarily restructuring reserves 

while over 85 of the cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2014 is considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott may be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbott believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2014 can be considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

abbott funded 393 million in 2014 724 million in 2013 and 379 million in 2012 to defined benefit pension plans abbott expects pension funding of approximately 585 million in 2015 for its pension plans of which approximately 470 million relates to its main domestic pension plans abbott expects to fund cash dividends capital expenditures and its other investments in its businesses with cash flow from operating activities cash on hand shortterm investments and borrowings 

debt and capital 

at december 31 2014 abbotts longterm debt rating was a by standard  poors corporation and a1 by moodys investors service abbott has readily available financial resources including unused lines of credit of 50 billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements which expire in 2019 

in 2014 abbott redeemed approximately 500 million of longterm notes that were assumed as part of the acquisition of cfr pharmaceuticals in 2012 abbott redeemed 77 billion of longterm notes in preparation for the separation of abbvie from abbott and repaid 1 billion of longterm notes that were due in 2012 in addition abbvie inc a wholly owned subsidiary of abbott issued 147 billion of longterm notes that were guaranteed by abbott until abbvies separation from abbott on january 1 2013 

in september 2014 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3 billion of abbotts common shares from time to time the new authorization is in addition to the 512 million unused portion of a previous program announced in june 2013 under the program announced in june 2013 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 30 billion of abbotts common shares under this program abbott repurchased 546 million shares at a cost of 21 billion in 2014 and 105 million shares at a cost of 388 million in the last six months of 2013 leaving 512 million unused under this program in the first six months of 2013 330 million shares were purchased at a cost of approximately 12 billion which was under a previous share repurchase authorization 

abbott declared dividends of 090 per share in 2014 compared to 064 per share in 2013 a 40 increase dividends paid were 1342 billion in 2014 compared to 882 million in 2013 the yearoveryear change in dividends reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate 

working capital 

the increase of cash and cash equivalents from 35 billion at december 31 2013 to 41 billion at december 31 2014 reflects the increase in cash generated by operating activities as well as the proceeds from the sale of investment securities working capital was 47 billion at december 31 2014 and 97 billion at december 31 2013 the decrease in working capital in 2014 was due to a decline in shortterm investments and an increase in shortterm borrowings primarily to fund recent acquisitions and share repurchases 

substantially all of abbotts trade receivables in italy spain portugal and greece are with governmental health systems the collection of outstanding receivables in these countries improved in 2014 as a result governmental receivables in these four countries accounted for less than 1 percent of abbotts total assets and 9 percent of total net trade receivables as of december 31 2014 down from 12 percent as of december 31 2013 

with the exception of greece abbott historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries abbott continues to monitor the credit worthiness of customers located in these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected in addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments in these countries abbott regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbott also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbott may not be able to collect the entire balance 

foreign currency developments 

since january 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap in 2014 the government of venezuela operated multiple mechanisms to exchange bolivars into us dollars in 2014 abbott continued to use the official rate of 63 venezuelan bolivars to the us dollar to report the results financial position and cash flows related to its operations in venezuela since abbott continued to qualify for this exchange rate to pay for the import of various products into venezuela abbott cannot predict whether there will be a devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar or whether it will continue to be able to exchange bolivars at the 63 rate as of december 31 2014 abbott had net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation in venezuela of approximately 240 million in 2014 revenue from operations in venezuela represented approximately 2 of abbotts total net sales 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures of 11 billion in 2014 and 2013 and 18 billion in 2012 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments investments in information technology and laboratory instruments placed with customers 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 



a purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements 

b unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately 13 billion are excluded from the table above as abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items see note 14 — taxes on income for further details the company has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postemployment benefits including medical and life which have been excluded from the table a discussion of the companys pension and postretirement plans including funding matters is included in note 13 — postemployment benefits 

contingent obligations 

abbott has periodically entered into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business such as assignment of product rights which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these obligations based upon past experience the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote in addition abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events 

legislative issues 

abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors to the annual report on form 10k 

recently issued accounting standards 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and will supersede most existing revenue recognition guidance early adoption is not permitted the standard becomes effective for abbott in the first quarter of 2017 abbott is currently evaluating the effect if any that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

financial instruments and risk management 

market price sensitive investments 

abbott holds availableforsale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions the fair value of these investments was approximately 9 million and 26 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease is due to the sale of securities abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs a hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at december 31 2014 by approximately 1 million a 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in share prices 

nonpublicly traded equity securities 

abbott holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges the carrying value of these investments was approximately 100 million and 67 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively no individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of 25 million abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs

at december 31 2014 and 2013 abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 15 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged abbott does not use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities at december 31 2014 abbott had 39 billion of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 012 with an average remaining life of 36 days the fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2014 and 2013 amounted to 41 billion and 39 billion respectively average interest rates of 53 and 53 as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively with maturities through 2040 at december 31 2014 and 2013 the fair value of current and longterm investment securities amounted to approximately 626 million and 47 billion respectively a hypothetical 100basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows income or fair values a 100basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in rates 

foreign currency sensitive financial instruments 

certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are markedtomarket with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold generally within the next twelve to eighteen months at december 31 2014 and 2013 abbott held 15 billion and 137 million respectively of such contracts contracts held at december 31 2014 will mature in 2015 or 2016 depending upon the contract contracts held at december 31 2013 matured in 2014 

abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and thirdparty trade payables and receivables the contracts are markedtomarket and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed at december 31 

2014 and 2013 abbott held 141 billion and 138 billion respectively of such contracts which generally mature in the next twelve months 

abbott has designated foreign denominated shortterm debt of approximately 445 million and approximately 505 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary accordingly changes in the fair value of this debt due to changes in exchange rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax

information with respect to abbotts business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to abbotts operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and abroad there have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies 

patents trademarks and licenses 

abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for abbotts products in the united states and countries of interest to abbott abbott owns and is licensed under a substantial number of patents and patent applications principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the narrative description of business on pages 1 through 4 these and various patents which expire during the period 2014 to 2034 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbotts business abbott believes that no single patent license or trademark is material in relation to abbotts business as a whole patentrelated litigation is discussed in legal proceedings on pages 17 through 18 

seasonal aspects customers backlog and renegotiation 

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbotts business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott orders for abbotts products are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbotts business no material portion of abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government 

research and development 

abbott spent approximately 15 billion per year in 2013 2012 and 2011 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2013 were approximately 9 million and 35 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2014 are estimated to be 11 million and 36 million respectively 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency epa or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 69000 persons as of december 31 2013 

regulation 

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbotts products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbotts international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries these may require local investment restrict abbotts investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products in addition abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbotts business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

abbotts business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbotts products for the foreseeable future 

in the united states the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products the centers for medicare and medicaid services have announced plans to reevaluate reimbursement levels to diagnostic 

laboratories under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbott must pay an excise tax on sales of certain medical devices medicare also implemented a competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies 

in the united states governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbotts nutrition business under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data beginning in 2014 to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain patient health information is increasing for example the european union continues to contemplate enacting stricter laws with enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance similarly in 2013 the us department of health and human services issued stricter rules governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information failure to comply with data privacy and security regulations can result in enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties transferring and managing protected health information will become more challenging as new laws and regulations are enacted and abbott expects there will be increasing regulatory complexity in this area 

abbott expects debate to continue during 2014 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

international operations 

as discussed in greater detail in the section captioned narrative description of business abbott markets products worldwide through affiliates and distributors most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the united states in addition certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the united states international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbotts securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbotts actual results abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned regulation to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns many of abbotts facilities and procedures and those of abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbotts products and criminal prosecution these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbotts business practices 

and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbotts facilities while abbott or abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbotts industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs in the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbotts business 

a number of the provisions of the us patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 change access to health care products and services and establish new fees for the medical device industry future rulemaking could increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or require additional reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbotts future revenues and operating income 

many of abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbotts intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbotts business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbotts intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced litigation regarding abbotts patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned legal proceedings 

competitors intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbotts revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbotts products to become obsolete causing abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer 

new products and technological advances by abbotts competitors may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

abbotts products face intense competition from its competitors products competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbotts products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbotts business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

significant safety concerns could arise for abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive 

studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbotts products 

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits safety alerts or product recalls and other allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbotts business and reputation and on abbotts ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs including health care deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt including credit downgrades could increase abbotts collection risk where a significant amount of abbotts receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems 

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on abbotts results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of abbotts information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption abbotts systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a significant effect on abbotts business 

abbott may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation 

abbvie and abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of abbvie from abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time if abbvie is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations abbott could incur operational difficulties or losses these arrangements could also lead to disputes between abbott and abbvie over abbotts rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations 

the separation and distribution agreement also provides for among other things indemnification obligations designed to make abbvie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after abbvies separation from abbott as well as those obligations of abbott assumed by abbvie pursuant to the separation and distribution 

agreement it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between abbott and abbvie and require abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to abbvie third parties could also seek to hold abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations the indemnity rights abbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect abbott even if abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification abbott may have to bear losses temporarily in addition abbotts indemnity obligations to abbvie may be significant these risks could negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

there could be significant liability if the distribution of abbvie common stock to abbott shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

abbott received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to the effect that among other things the separation and the distribution of abbvie qualifies as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the code in addition abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from abbott and abbvie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the receipt by abbott of the private letter ruling from the irs and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of abbott or abbvie after the separation if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes abbott and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

the international nature of abbotts business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbotts business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally sales outside of the united states make up approximately 70 percent of abbotts net sales additional risks associated with abbotts international operations include 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates • differing local product preferences and product requirements • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations • differing labor regulations • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws • political and economic instability including sovereign debt issues • price and currency exchange controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action • inflation recession and fluctuations in interest rates • compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property and 13 

• potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anticorruption antibribery and other similar laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbotts profitability and its financial condition including 

• changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements product marketing application standards product labeling source and use laws and environmental laws • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value particularly for pensions retiree health care stock compensation intangibles and goodwill and for contingent liabilities such as litigation the absence of a recorded amount or an amount recorded at the minimum compared to the actual amount • changes in the rate of inflation including the cost of raw materials commodities and supplies interest rates market value of abbotts equity investments and the performance of investments held by abbott or abbotts employee benefit trusts • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to abbott or abbotts employee benefit trusts • changes in business economic and political conditions including war political instability terrorist attacks the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action natural disasters the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events labor disputes strikes slowdowns or other forms of labor or union activity and pressure from thirdparty interest groups • changes in abbotts business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies changing product mix changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the us and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future • changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor retailer or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions pricing seasonality or other factors or other problems with licensors suppliers distributors and business partners • changes in credit markets impacting abbotts ability to obtain financing for its business operations and • legal difficulties any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations and adverse litigation decisions cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial review 

abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbotts products under a contract most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs abbotts primary products are nutritional products branded generic pharmaceuticals diagnostic testing products and vascular products sales in international markets comprise approximately 70 percent of consolidated net sales 

in october 2011 abbott announced a plan to separate into two publicly traded companies one in diversified medical products and the other in researchbased pharmaceuticals to accomplish the separation abbott created a new company abbvie inc abbvie for its researchbased pharmaceuticals business which consists primarily of abbotts historical proprietary pharmaceutical products segment on january 1 2013 abbott distributed all of the outstanding shares of abbvie to abbotts shareholders and abbvie became an independent company trading under the symbol abbv the historical operating results of the researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business prior to separation are excluded from earnings from continuing operations and are presented on the earnings from discontinued operations line in abbotts consolidated statement of earnings the assets liabilities and cash flows of the researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business are included in abbotts consolidated balance sheet and its consolidated statements of cash flows for periods prior to january 1 2013 

sales growth and margin improvement in the nutritional and diagnostics businesses and the challenging economic and fiscal environment in many countries around the world have impacted abbotts sales costs and financial position over the last three years sales in emerging markets increased 11 percent per year in 2013 and 2012 excluding foreign exchange despite the slowdown in several emerging economies and a weakening of key emerging market currencies in 2013 emerging markets include all countries except the united states western europe japan canada and australia 

in abbotts worldwide nutritional products business sales over the last three years were positively impacted by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets as well as by numerous new product introductions that leveraged abbotts strong brands at the same time manufacturing and distribution process changes and other cost reductions drove margin improvements across the business operating margins for this business increased from 132 percent in 2011 to 187 percent in 2013 

in 2013 sales growth in international pediatric nutrition was affected by a product recall initiated in august 2013 in china and two other markets for certain pediatric nutritional products supplied to abbott by a thirdparty manufacturer while there were no health issues associated with the recalled products and the supplier subsequently determined that the products had been safe for consumption the recall created significant disruption in these markets as a result international pediatric nutrition sales were significantly lower than abbotts previous expectations for this business for the second half of 2013 while abbott initiated investments in the third quarter of 2013 in these markets to rebuild consumer confidence abbott expects the recall to continue to have a negative impact on sales in the first half of 2014 

in abbotts worldwide diagnostics business margin improvement continued to be a key focus in 2013 operating margins increased from 192 percent of sales in 2011 to 222 percent in 2013 as the business continued to execute on efficiency initiatives in the manufacturing and supply chain functions in addition to continued margin improvement unit growth across geographical regions positively impacted worldwide 

diagnostic sales worldwide sales for this business increased 83 percent in 2013 and 73 percent in 2012 excluding foreign exchange 

in the established pharmaceutical products segment macroeconomic and market pressures in certain emerging markets impacted this business in 2013 nevertheless sales in this segments 14 key emerging markets increased 63 percent in 2013 excluding the effect of foreign exchange however the growth in emerging markets was largely offset by declines in developed markets where austerity measures have continued to impact performance 

over the last three years in the vascular business abbott continued to build its xience drugeluting stent franchise with the receipt of approval to market xience xpedition in various countries including japanese approval in the third quarter of 2013 and us approval in the fourth quarter of 2012 xience pro received ce mark approval in the second quarter of 2012 abbotts market share also benefited from the us launches of xience nano and xience prime in 2011 and the japanese launches of xience prime small vessel des in 2013 and xience prime in april 2012 xience  which includes xience v  prime nano pro and xpedition  ended 2013 as the marketleading drug eluting stent globally in 2013 absorb and mitraclip also contributed to sales growth in 2011 the third party distributor of the promus product began transitioning away from the product and that supply agreement ended in 2012 the effect of the winding down of the agreement continued into the first quarter of 2013 

abbotts short and longterm debt totaled 66 billion at december 31 2013 at december 31 2013 abbotts longterm debt rating was a by standard and poors corporation and a1 by moodys investors service in the fourth quarter of 2012 abbott extinguished 77 billion of longterm debt and incurred a charge of 135 billion related to the early repayment net of gains from the unwinding of interest rate swaps related to the debt in october 2013 abbott announced a 57 percent increase in abbotts quarterly dividend to 022 per share from 014 per share effective with the dividend paid in february 2014 

in 2014 abbott will focus on several key initiatives in the nutritional business abbott will continue to build its product portfolio with the introduction of new sciencebased products expand in highgrowth emerging markets and implement additional margin improvement initiatives in the established pharmaceuticals business abbott will continue to focus on obtaining additional product approvals across numerous countries and expanding its presence in emerging markets in the diagnostics business abbott will focus on the development of nextgeneration instrument platforms and other advanced technologies expansion in emerging markets and further improvements in the segments operating margin in the vascular business abbott will continue to focus on marketing products in the xience and endovascular franchises and increasing mitraclip sales as well as further clinical development of absorb  its bioresorbable vascular scaffold bvs device and a further penetration of absorb in numerous countries in abbotts other segments abbott will focus on developing differentiated technologies in higher growth markets 

critical accounting policies 

sales rebates — in 2013 approximately 49 percent of abbotts consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances are in the established pharmaceuticals and nutritional products segments abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product 

settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 amounted to approximately 20 billion 19 billion and 17 billion respectively or 161 percent 160 percent and 168 percent respectively based on gross sales of approximately 125 billion 118 billion and 101 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 125 million in 2013 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 150 million 149 million and 117 million for cash discounts in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and 208 million 199 million and 170 million for returns in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbotts historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management has access to several large customers inventory management data and for other customers utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data in addition internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the states and internally administered market research the usda has been making its data available for many years internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data at december 31 2013 abbott had wic business in 23 states 

historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items are often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbotts federal income tax returns through 2010 are settled except for three items and the income tax returns for years after 2010 are open abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan 

assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for decades can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2013 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 18 billion and 82 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 12 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk the cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs at december 31 2013 goodwill amounted to 98 billion and intangibles amounted to 57 billion and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to 791 million in 2013 795 million in 2012 and 884 million in 2011 there were no impairments of goodwill in 2013 2012 or 2011 in 2012 and 2011 abbott recorded impairment charges of 69 million and 125 million respectively for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects 

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 450 contingencies under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 70 million to 90 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 80 million have been recorded at december 31 2013 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent managements best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 contingencies 

results of operations 

sales 

the following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years 



the increases in total net sales in 2013 and 2012 reflect unit growth partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange the price declines related to vascular products sales in 2013 and 2012 primarily reflect pricing pressure on drug eluting stents and other coronary products as a result of market competition in major markets 

a comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 



1 other coronary products include primarily guidewires and balloon catheters endovascular includes vessel closure carotid stents and other peripheral products 

excluding the unfavorable effect of exchange total established pharmaceutical products sales increased 07 percent in 2013 and 21 percent in 2012 the established pharmaceutical products segment is focused on 14 key emerging markets including india russia china and brazil excluding the effect of exchange sales in these 14 key emerging markets increased 63 percent in 2013 and 128 percent in 2012 as macroeconomic and market pressures in various emerging markets negatively affected 2013 growth excluding the effect of exchange sales in established pharmaceuticals other markets decreased 4 percent in 2013 and 56 percent in 2012 these declines in the other markets category reflect unfavorable market conditions including the continued effects of european austerity measures and 2012 japanese pricing actions 

excluding the unfavorable effect of exchange total nutritional products sales increased 54 percent in 2013 and 89 percent in 2012 international pediatric nutritional sales increased in 2013 and 2012 due primarily to volume growth in developing countries a suppliers recall of product in august 2013 in certain international markets negatively impacted international pediatric nutritional sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 while there were no health issues associated with this supplier recall and the supplier subsequently determined that the product had been safe for consumption this event created significant disruption in these markets abbott expects this sales disruption to continue to negatively impact international pediatric nutritional growth in the first half of 2014 us pediatric sales were flat in 2013 due to lower formula share partially offset by higher shipments of toddler products us pediatric nutritional sales in 2012 reflect market share gains for similac and unit growth for pediasure 

the 2013 and 2012 increases in international adult nutritional sales are due primarily to volume growth in developing countries and were negatively impacted by the effect of the relatively stronger us dollar the 1 percent decline in 2013 us adult nutritional sales reflects abbotts exit from certain noncore business lines as part of the business margin improvement initiative most of the sales decline 

resulting from this exit was offset by higher ensure revenues the increase in 2012 us adult nutritional sales reflects unit growth for the ensure and glucerna products 

excluding the unfavorable effect of exchange total diagnostic products sales increased 83 percent in 2013 and 73 percent in 2012 the sales increases reflect unit growth across geographical regions 2013 and 2012 sales of immunochemistry products the largest category in this segment reflect continued execution of abbotts strategy to deliver integrated solutions to large healthcare customers 

excluding the unfavorable effect of exchange total vascular products sales were flat in 2013 and decreased 56 percent in 2012 in 2013 growth in international markets driven by continued share gains in key geographies of xience xpedition and absorb was offset by declines in the us market due to the negative impact of pricing pressure and a decline in procedures due to market conditions as well as the expected decline of certain royalty revenues in 2012 the decrease in vascular products sales was due to pricing pressure as well as the expected winding down of royalty and supply agreements related to certain thirdparty products including promus excluding this royalty and supply agreement revenue in both periods and the unfavorable effect of exchange vascular products sales increased 34 percent in 2012 

abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were not significant in 2013 2012 and 2011 

the expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to affect abbott 

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 504 percent of net sales in 2013 506 percent in 2012 and 491 percent in 2011 the gross profit margin in 2013 remained relatively unchanged versus the prior year as improved margins in the nutritional and diagnostics products segments were offset by margin declines in established pharmaceuticals and vascular products due to pricing pressures and unfavorable product mix as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange across segments the increase in the gross profit margin in 2012 was impacted by improved gross margins across all reportable segments as a result of cost reduction initiatives the impact of exchange and favorable product mix 

in the us states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products in numerous countries these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional and established pharmaceutical products segments 

research and development expense was 1452 billion in 2013 1544 billion in 2012 and 1512 billion in 2011 and represented a 60 percent decrease in 2013 and a 21 percent increase in 2012 the 2013 decrease primarily reflects the incurrence of restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2012 which did not recur in 2013 in 2013 research and development expenditures totaled 336 million for the vascular products segment 416 million for the diagnostics products segment 239 million for the established pharmaceutical products segment and 188 million for the nutritional products segment 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 68 percent in 2013 and increased 11 percent in 2012 the 2013 decrease reflects the transfer of certain 2012 corporate costs to abbvie in the separation as well as certain information technology and other back office support costs that are being charged to abbvie in 2013 under transition services agreements prudent cost management and a reduction in restructuring costs also contributed to the decrease the 2012 increase primarily reflects increased selling and marketing support for new products and geographical expansion largely offset by prudent cost management 

business acquisitions 

in august 2013 abbott acquired 100 percent of idev technologies net of debt for 310 million in cash the acquisition of idev technologies expands abbotts endovascular portfolio the allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in nondeductible acquired inprocess research and development of approximately 170 million which is accounted for as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation nondeductible definitelived intangible assets of approximately 66 million nondeductible goodwill of approximately 123 million and net deferred tax liabilities of 56 million acquired intangible assets consist of developed technology and are being amortized over 11 years 

in august 2013 abbott acquired 100 percent of optimedica for 260 million in cash plus additional payments up to 150 million to be made upon completion of certain development regulatory and sales milestones the acquisition of optimedica provides abbott with an immediate entry point into the laser assisted cataract surgery market the allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in nondeductible definitelived intangible assets of approximately 160 million nondeductible acquired inprocess research and development of approximately 60 million which is accounted for as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation nondeductible goodwill of approximately 151 million net deferred tax liabilities of 70 million and contingent consideration of approximately 70 million the fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on an independent appraisal acquired intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology that is being amortized over 18 years 

the preliminary allocations of the fair value of these acquisitions will be finalized when valuations are completed had the above acquisitions taken place on january 1 of the previous year consolidated net sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts 

restructurings 

in 2013 abbott management approved a plan to reduce costs and improve efficiencies across various functional areas as well as a plan to streamline certain manufacturing operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in abbotts established pharmaceuticals business in 2012 abbott management approved plans to streamline various commercial operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in abbotts core diagnostics established pharmaceutical and nutritionals businesses abbott recorded employee related severance charges of approximately 78 million in 2013 and 167 million in 2012 additional charges of approximately 4 million and 22 million were also recorded in 2013 and 2012 respectively primarily for asset impairments approximately 35 million in 2013 and 70 million in 2012 is recorded in cost of products sold and approximately 47 million in 2013 and 119 million in 2012 is recorded as selling general and administrative expense 

in 2013 and prior years abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs in 2013 abbott recorded employee severance charges of approximately 11 million in 2011 abbott recorded charges of approximately 194 million reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets employee severance and other related charges approximately 11 million in 2013 and 18 million in 2011 is classified as cost of products sold the remaining 2011 charge of 176 million related to businesses transferred to abbvie and is being recognized in the results of discontinued operations an additional 41 million 110 million and 25 million were recorded in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively relating to these restructurings primarily for accelerated depreciation 

in 2012 abbott recorded a charge of approximately 150 million for employee severance and contractual obligations primarily related to the exit from a research and development facility these charges related to businesses transferred to abbvie and have been recognized in the results of discontinued operations 

in 2011 abbott management approved plans to streamline global manufacturing operations reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in abbotts core diagnostic business in 2011 a charge of 28 million was recorded in cost of products sold in addition charges of approximately 16 million and 42 million were recorded in 2012 and 2011 primarily for accelerated depreciation and product transfer costs 

interest expense 

in 2013 interest expense decreased due to a lower level of borrowings which resulted from the transfer of approximately 146 billion of debt to abbvie as part of the separation in 2012 interest expense included bridge facility fees related to the separation of abbvie from abbott 

change in accounting principle and other income expense net 

prior to january 1 2011 the accounts of foreign subsidiaries were consolidated based on a fiscal year ended november 30 due to the time needed to consolidate these subsidiaries effective january 1 2011 the one month lag in the consolidation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries was eliminated and the yearend of foreign subsidiaries was changed to december 31 abbott believes that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the one month reporting lag is preferable because it results in more contemporaneous reporting of the results of foreign subsidiaries in accordance with applicable accounting literature a change in subsidiaries yearend is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application a charge of 100 million was recorded to other income expense net in 2011 to recognize the cumulative immaterial impacts to 2009 and 2010 

other income expense net for 2013 includes gains on sales of investments 2012 includes income of approximately 40 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement 

net loss on extinguishment of debt 

in 2012 abbott extinguished 77 billion of longterm debt and incurred a cost of 135 billion to extinguish this debt net of gains from the unwinding of interest rate swaps related to the debt 

taxes on earnings 

the income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 55 percent in 2013 897 percent in 2012 and 89 percent in 2011 2013 taxes on earnings from continuing operations include 234 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of various tax positions from previous years in addition as a result of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 signed into law in january 2013 abbott recorded a tax benefit to taxes on continuing operations of approximately 103 million in 2013 for the retroactive extension of the research tax credit and the lookthrough rules of section 954c6 of the internal revenue code to the beginning of 2012 taxes on earnings from continuing operations in 2012 reflect the 472 million effect of the tax rate applied to abbotts net debt extinguishment loss as well as the recognition of 212 million of tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to a prior year taxes on earnings from continuing operations in 2011 reflect the recognition of 168 million of tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years exclusive of these discrete items the effective rates are lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to the benefit of lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income that reduced the tax rates by 180 757 and 149 percentage points in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the tax rate reductions are primarily derived from operations in puerto rico switzerland ireland and singapore where abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules tax rulings grants and exemptions see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate 

in 2014 abbott expects to repatriate approximately 2 billion of 2014 earnings generated outside the us abbott also expects to be able to accelerate the utilization of deferred tax assets and thereby reduce 

the cash taxes due in the us on this repatriation to no more than 150 million this repatriation is projected to result in approximately 550 to 600 million of additional tax expense in abbotts 2014 statement of earnings excluding the tax effect of this repatriation abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of approximately 19 percent to 2014 results 

separation of abbvie inc 

on november 28 2012 abbotts board of directors declared a special dividend distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of abbvie inc abbvie the company formed to hold abbotts researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business for each abbott common share held at the close of business on december 12 2012 abbott shareholders received one share of abbvie stock on january 1 2013 abbott has received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the separation qualifies as a taxfree distribution to abbott and its us shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

the historical operating results of the researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business prior to separation are excluded from earnings from continuing operations and are presented on the earnings from discontinued operations line discontinued operations include the results of abbvies business except for certain corporate overhead costs and certain costs associated with transition services that will be provided by abbott to abbvie discontinued operations also include other costs incurred by abbott to separate abbvie as well as an allocation of interest assuming a uniform ratio of consolidated debt to equity for all of abbotts historical operations the assets liabilities and cash flows of the researchbased proprietary pharmaceuticals business are included in abbotts consolidated balance sheet and its consolidated statements of cash flows for periods prior to january 1 2013 

the following is a summary of the assets and liabilities transferred to abbvie as part of the separation on january 1 2013  in billions  



in addition approximately 1 billion of accumulated other comprehensive losses net of income taxes primarily related to the pension and other benefit plan net liabilities as well as foreign translation was transferred to abbvie 

in 2013 discontinued operations includes a favorable adjustment to tax expense of 193 million as a result of the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to 2010 related to abbvies operations summarized financial information for discontinued operations for 2012 and 2011 is as follows 



abbott and abbvie entered into transitional services agreements prior to the separation pursuant to which abbott and abbvie are providing various services to each other on an interim transitional basis transition services may be provided for up to 24 months with an option for a oneyear extension by the recipient services being provided by abbott include certain information technology and back office support billings by abbott under these transitional services agreements are recorded as a reduction of the costs to provide the respective service in the applicable expense category in the consolidated statement of earnings this transitional support will enable abbvie to establish its standalone processes for various activities that were previously provided by abbott and does not constitute significant continuing support of abbvies operations 

for a small portion of abbvies operations the legal transfer of abbvies assets net of liabilities did not occur with the separation of abbvie on january 1 2013 due to the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and other regulatory requirements in each of these countries under the terms of the separation agreement with abbott abbvie is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets the majority of these operations were transferred to abbvie in 2013 with the remainder expected to be transferred in 2014 these assets and liabilities have been presented as held for disposition in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 the assets and liabilities held for disposition consist of inventories of 243 million trade accounts receivable of 163 million other current assets of 32 million equipment of 28 million other assets of 38 million trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 386 million and other liabilities of 7 million abbotts obligation to transfer the net assets held for disposition to abbvie of 111 million is included in other accrued liabilities

research and development programs 

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical device diagnostic and nutritional products in development 

research and development process 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segments existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity 

depending upon the product the phases of development may include 

• drug product development • phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceuticals brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api • phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients • phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use • phase iv and other postmarketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china 

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include 

• discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need • conceptfeasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility and • development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fdas premarketing approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a biological license application bla 

in the eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which is governed by the european invitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive other products only require a selfcertification process 

in the vascular segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design completion of clinical trials to test the products safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications 

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us vascular products are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbotts vascular products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 

in the eu vascular products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which is governed by the european medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 

after approval and commercial launch of some vascular products postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants athletes or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a products efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted most other product development such as a product form change from liquid to powder generally does not necessitate clinical studies 

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fdas confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutrition products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products 

areas of focus 

in 2014 and beyond abbotts significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following 

established pharmaceuticals — abbott is actively working on development plans for about 20  30 key brands depending on the product the development activities focus on new data markets formulations combinations or indications abbott focuses on building countryspecific portfolios made up of global and local pharmaceutical brands that best meet each local markets needs over the next several years established pharmaceuticals will work to expand its product portfolio in its key markets through further geographic expansion of existing brands new product enhancements and strategic licensing activities

given the diversity of abbotts business its intention to remain a broadbased healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbotts overall market position there were no delays in abbotts 2013 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbotts ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each year abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period 

goodwill 

at december 31 2013 goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled 98 billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the medical optics unit while the fair value of the medical optics business exceeds its carrying value extended economic pressure on governmentreimbursed cataract procedures in europe and on the global lasik surgery business as well as longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development the integration of optimedica and the negative impact of foreign currency movements could result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the medical optics unit has declined below its carrying value thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment 

financial condition 

cash flow 

net cash from operating activities amounted to 33 billion 93 billion and 90 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2013 was due to the separation of abbvie on january 1 2013 net cash from operating activities in 2013 reflects approximately 435 million of onetime net cash outflows related to the separation of abbvie and 724 million of contributions to defined benefit pension plans the income tax component of operating cash flow in 2013 2012 and 2011 includes 427 million 408 million and 580 million respectively of noncash tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years and 2013 also includes a 103 million tax benefit for the retroactive impact of us tax law changes which is expected to be 

realized in future years trade accounts payable and other liabilities in net cash from operating activities in 2012 includes the payment of approximately 15 billion related to a litigation accrual recorded in 2011 related to the business operations of abbvie this was partially offset by increases in other liabilities primarily restructuring reserves 

while substantially all cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 is considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbott believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2013 can be considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

abbott funded 724 million in 2013 379 million in 2012 and 394 million in 2011 to defined benefit pension plans abbott expects pension funding of approximately 400 million in 2014 for its pension plans of which approximately 300 million relates to its main domestic pension plans abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends 

debt and capital 

at december 31 2013 abbotts longterm debt rating was a by standard  poors corporation and a1 by moodys investors service abbott has readily available financial resources including unused lines of credit of 50 billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements which expire in 2017

working capital 

the reduction of cash and cash equivalents from 108 billion at december 31 2012 to 35 billion at december 31 2013 reflects the transfer of 59 billion of cash and cash equivalents to abbvie as part of the separation on january 1 2013 working capital was 97 billion at december 31 2013 and 180 billion at december 31 2012 the decrease in working capital in 2013 was due to the transfer of approximately 9 billion of working capital to abbvie on january 1 2013 as part of the separation see note 2 — separation of abbvie for additional information 

substantially all of abbotts trade receivables in italy spain portugal and greece are with governmental health systems the collection of outstanding receivables in these countries held steady or improved in 2013 depending upon the country as a result governmental receivables in these four countries accounted for approximately 1 percent of abbotts total assets and 12 percent of total net trade receivables as of december 31 2013 the latter is down from 16 percent as of december 31 2012 

with the exception of greece abbott historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries abbott continues to monitor the credit worthiness of customers located in these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected in addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments in these countries abbott regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbott also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbott may not be able to collect the entire balance 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures of 11 billion in 2013 18 billion in 2012 and 15 billion in 2011 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments investments in information technology and laboratory instruments placed with customers the 2013 decrease reflects the separation of abbvie at the beginning of 2013 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 



a purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements b unrecognized tax benefits totaling 13 billion are excluded from the table above as abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items see note 13 — taxes on income for further details the company has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postemployment benefits including medical and life which have been excluded from the table a discussion of the companys pension and postretirement plans including funding matters is included in note 12 — postemployment benefits 

contingent obligations 

abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business such as assignment of product rights with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these obligations based upon past experience the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote in addition abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events 

legislative issues 

abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors to the annual report on form 10k

information with respect to abbotts business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to abbotts operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and abroad there have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages 

patents trademarks and licenses 

abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for abbotts products in the united states and all countries of major marketing interest to abbott abbott owns and is licensed under a substantial number of patents and patent applications principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the narrative description of business on pages 1 through 5 these and various patents which expire during the period 2013 to 2032 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbotts business abbott believes that after the separation of abbvie no single patent license or trademark is material in relation to abbotts business as a whole in connection with the separation and distribution of abbvie abbott contributed certain pharmaceutical related patents licenses and trademarks to abbvie patentrelated litigation is discussed in legal proceedings on pages 18 through 20 

seasonal aspects customers backlog and renegotiation 

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbotts business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott orders for abbotts products are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbotts business no material portion of abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

research and development 

abbott spent approximately 43 billion in 2012 41 billion in 2011 and 37 billion in 2010 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes the majority of research and development expenditures was concentrated on proprietary pharmaceutical products 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2012 were approximately 12 million and 63 million respectively after the separation of abbvie capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2013 are estimated to be 10 million and 53 million respectively 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive 

environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency epa or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 91000 persons as of december 31 2012 approximately 21000 persons were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation 

regulation 

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international regulatory agencies government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies both domestic and international addresses among other matters the development and approval to market abbotts products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbotts international operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by local and international laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide among other things guidance on corporate interactions with government officials in addition abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights and control the entrance of multisource drugs for small molecule and generic biologic medicines 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbotts business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbotts business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of marketing of such products domestically or globally and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the 

private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing and are adopting laws and rules to govern the introduction of biosimilar products domestic and foreign budgetary pressures may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbotts products for the foreseeable future 

specifically us federal laws requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbotts proprietary pharmaceutical business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 requires manufacturers to extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the department of veterans affairs department of defense public health service entities and institutions as well as certain other covered entities the veterans health care act also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to designated health care facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products end stage renal disease treatment is covered through a bundled payment that likewise creates incentives for providers to control costs medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for medicine delivered under part d 

under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbott pays a fee related to its pharmaceutical sales to government programs in 2011 abbott began providing a discount of 50 percent for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole the affordable care act has also implemented the medicare shared savings program which created accountable care organizations the program provides incentives for health care providers to potentially reduce utilization of health care products by allowing accountable care organizations to share in medicare savings in 2013 as a result of the affordable care act manufacturers will begin paying an excise tax on sales of certain medical devices medicare is also implementing a competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs biologics devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid starting in 2013 to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data beginning in 2014 to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

with the separation of abbvie at the beginning of 2013 abbott no longer sells pharmaceutical products in the us and therefore is no longer subject to certain fees rebates and discounts applicable to us pharmaceutical manufacturers 

in the united states governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbotts nutrition business under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program 

abbott expects debate to continue during 2013 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

on april 19 2012 the us district court for the northern district of illinois vacated a consent decree to which abbott was previously a party the consent decree required abbott to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing processes in lake county illinois conform to the us food and drug administrations fda quality system regulation and restricted the sale in the united states of certain products in the diagnostic products segment in 2003 the fda concluded that those operations were in substantial conformity with the quality system regulation 

international operations 

abbott markets products worldwide through affiliates and distributors most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the united states in addition certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the united states international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbotts securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbotts actual results abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbotts future revenues and operating income 

many of abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbotts intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbotts business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbotts intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced abbotts patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in the section captioned patents trademarks and licenses and litigation regarding these patents is described in the section captioned legal proceedings 

competitors intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in 

greater detail in the section captioned regulation to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns many of abbotts facilities and procedures and those of abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbotts products and criminal prosecution these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbotts business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbotts facilities while abbott or abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbotts industry is also subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbotts business 

a number of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement the laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries future rulemaking could increase rebates reduce prices or 

the rate of price increases for health care products and services or require additional reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking 

abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbotts revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbotts products to become obsolete causing abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer 

new products and technological advances by abbotts competitors may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

abbotts products face intense competition from its competitors products competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbotts products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbotts business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

significant safety issues could arise for abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbotts products 

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbotts business and reputation and on abbotts ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

further deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain european countries may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

if economic conditions in certain european countries including greece portugal italy and spain continue to worsen the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables may increase financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs including health care at the same time ongoing sovereign debt issues including the impact of credit downgrades could increase abbotts collection risk given that a significant amount of abbotts receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems 

abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on abbotts results of operations 

similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of abbotts information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption abbotts systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a significant effect on abbotts business 

abbott may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation 

abbvie and abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of abbvie from abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time if abbvie is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations abbott could incur operational difficulties or losses these arrangements could also lead to disputes between abbott and abbvie over 

abbotts rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations 

the separation and distribution agreement also provides for among other things indemnification obligations designed to make abbvie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after abbvies separation from abbott as well as those obligations of abbott assumed by abbvie pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between abbott and abbvie and require abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to abbvie third parties could also seek to hold abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations the indemnity rights abbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect abbott even if abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification abbott may have to bear losses temporarily in addition abbotts indemnity obligations to abbvie may be significant these risks could negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

there could be significant liability if the distribution of abbvie common stock to abbott shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

abbott received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to the effect that among other things the separation and the distribution of abbvie qualifies as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the code in addition abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from abbott and abbvie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the receipt by abbott of the private letter ruling from the irs and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of abbott or abbvie after the separation if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes abbott and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

the international nature of abbotts business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbotts business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally following the separation of abbvie sales outside of the united states are expected to make up approximately 70 percent of abbotts net sales the risks associated with abbotts operations outside the united states include 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates • changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs • multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict abbotts ability to manufacture market and sell its products • differing local product preferences and product requirements • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations 14 

• differing labor regulations • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws • political and economic instability including sovereign debt issues • price and currency exchange controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action • inflation recession and fluctuations in interest rates • compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anticorruption antibribery and other similar laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbotts profitability and its financial condition including

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial review 

abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs abbotts primary products are nutritional products prescription pharmaceuticals diagnostic testing products and vascular products 

in october 2011 abbott announced a plan to separate into two publicly traded companies one in diversified medical products and the other in researchbased pharmaceuticals to accomplish the separation abbott created a new company abbvie inc abbvie for its researchbased pharmaceuticals business which consists primarily of abbotts proprietary pharmaceutical products segment on january 1 2013 abbott distributed all of the outstanding shares of abbvie to abbotts shareholders as a result of the distribution abbvie is now an independent company trading under the symbol abbv beginning in the first quarter of 2013 the historical results of the researchbased pharmaceuticals business will be reflected in abbotts consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 

prior to the separation of abbvie sales in international markets were approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales postseparation sales outside the us are expected to comprise approximately 70 percent of net sales 

continued robust growth of humira in a broad range of indications the acquisitions of solvays pharmaceuticals business solvay pharmaceuticals and piramal healthcare limiteds healthcare solutions business sales growth and margin improvement in the nutritional and diagnostics businesses a government investigation of abbotts sales and marketing activities related to depakote  and the challenging economic and fiscal environment in many countries around the world have impacted abbotts sales costs and financial position over the last three years 

pharmaceutical research and development was focused over the last three years on therapeutic areas that included immunology oncology neuroscience pain management hepatitis c hcv chronic kidney disease and womens health in addition abbott acquired the rights to various inprocess pharmaceutical research and development projects including the development of secondgeneration oral antioxidant inflammation modulators and an oral nextgeneration jak1 inhibitor with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases 

in 2003 abbott began the worldwide launch of humira for rheumatoid arthritis followed by launches for six additional indications in the us and eight additional indications in the european union humiras worldwide sales increased to 93 billion in 2012 compared to 79 billion in 2011 and 65 billion in 2010 generic competition for tricor began in the fourth quarter of 2012 austerity measures implemented by several european countries reduced healthcare spending and affected pharmaceutical pricing over the last three years the us proprietary pharmaceuticals business was negatively affected by the 2010 us health care reform legislation which resulted in rebate changes beginning in 2010 and the payment of an annual fee beginning in 2011 

in february 2010 abbott acquired solvay pharmaceuticals which provided abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expanded abbotts presence in key global emerging markets the acquisition added approximately 31 billion to abbotts 2010 net sales primarily outside the us in september 2010 abbott completed the acquisition of piramals healthcare solutions business propelling abbott to market leadership in the indian pharmaceutical market and further 

accelerating the companys growth in emerging markets abbott recorded expense of approximately 262 million in 2012 345 million in 2011 and 710 million in 2010 related to the integration of the solvay business and restructuring plans to streamline operations improve efficiencies and reduce costs primarily in certain solvay sites and functions 

in may 2012 abbott reached resolution of all depakote related federal claims medicaidrelated claims with 49 states and the district of columbia and consumer protection claims with 45 states and the district of columbia abbott recorded charges related to this matter of 15 billion in 2011 and 100 million in 2012 of which approximately 16 billion was paid in 2012 

in abbotts worldwide nutritional products business sales were positively impacted by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets as well as by numerous new product introductions that leveraged abbotts strong brands at the same time manufacturing and distribution process changes and other cost reductions drove margin improvements across the business 

in abbotts worldwide diagnostics business margin improvement continued to be a key focus and operating margins increased from 147 percent of sales in 2010 to 187 percent in 2012 

over the last three years abbott continued to build its xience drugeluting stent franchise with the receipt of approval to market xience xpedition in various countries including us approval in the fourth quarter of 2012 as well as the launches of xience nano and xience prime in the us in 2011 and xience prime and xience v in japan in april 2012 and january 2010 respectively xience  which includes xience v  prime nano and xpedition  ended 2012 as the marketleading drug eluting stent globally in 2011 the third party distributor of the promus product began transitioning away from the product and that supply agreement ended in 2012 the effect of the winding down of the agreement will continue into the first quarter of 2013 

in 2010 the us government passed health care reform legislation which included an increase in medicaid rebate rates and the extension of the rebate to drugs provided through medicaid managed care organizations beginning in 2010 the legislation also imposed annual fees which pharmaceutical manufacturers began paying in 2011 and medical device companies will begin paying in 2013 as well as additional rebates related to the medicare part d donut hole beginning in 2011 in addition to a 2010 onetime charge of approximately 60 million to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy the legislations negative impact on abbotts performance grew from more than 200 million in 2010 to approximately 400 million per year in 2011 and 2012 the 400 million annual impact included approximately 100 million for the annual pharmaceutical manufacturer fee this fee is not taxdeductible and is included in selling general and administrative expenses with the separation of abbvie at the beginning of 2013 abbott no longer sells pharmaceutical products in the us and therefore is no longer subject to the annual pharmaceutical fee or the additional rebates beginning in 2013 abbott will begin paying the 23 percent medical device tax under us health care reform legislation this tax will be included in selling general and administrative expenses and the amount of the tax is not expected to be material 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 abbott extinguished 77 billion of longterm debt and incurred a charge of 135 billion related to the early repayment net of gains from the unwinding of interest rate swaps related to the debt abbotts short and longterm debt totaled 205 billion at december 31 2012 this balance includes 1 billion of shortborrowings and 147 billion of longterm debt that was issued by abbvie inc in 2012 after the separation of abbvie on january 1 2013 abbott has no remaining obligations related to this 157 billion of debt at december 31 2012 abbotts longterm debt rating was a by standard and poors corporation and a1 by moodys investors service operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years 

in 2013 abbott will focus on several key initiatives in the nutritional business abbott will continue to build its product portfolio with the introduction of new sciencebased products expand in highgrowth emerging markets and implement additional margin improvement initiatives in the established pharmaceuticals business which includes international sales of branded generic products abbott will continue to focus on obtaining additional product approvals across numerous countries and expanding its presence in emerging markets in the diagnostics business abbott will focus on the development of nextgeneration instruments and other advanced technologies expansion in emerging markets and further improvements in the segments operating margin in the vascular business abbott will continue to focus on marketing products in the xience and endovascular franchises increasing international mitraclip sales and obtaining regulatory review of the mitraclip device in the us as well as further clinical development of absorb  its bioresorbable vascular scaffold bvs device and a further rollout of absorb in numerous countries in abbotts other segments abbott will focus on developing differentiated technologies in higher growth markets 

critical accounting policies 

sales rebates — in 2012 approximately 56 percent of abbotts consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances are in the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment and the nutritional products segment abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies state agencies that administer the federal medicaid program insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to eight months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 amounted to approximately 62 billion 55 billion and 49 billion respectively or 229 percent 222 percent and 231 percent respectively based on gross sales of approximately 269 billion 248 billion and 211 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 269 million in 2012 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 542 million 409 million and 415 million for cash discounts in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and 365 million 490 million and 537 million for returns in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbotts historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management has access to several large customers inventory management data and for other customers utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data in addition internal processing time is a factor in 

estimating the accrual in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the states and internally administered market research the usda has been making its data available for many years internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data at december 31 2012 abbott had wic business in 22 states 

in the domestic proprietary pharmaceutical business the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data to estimate the price rebate percentage systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant and abbott believes they are reliable 

the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals which comprise approximately 70 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2012 remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings  dollars in millions  



historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for medicaid medicare and other government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items are often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more 

than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbotts federal income tax returns through 2009 are settled except for one item and the income tax returns for years after 2009 are open abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for decades can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low asset returns due to poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2012 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 48 billion and 379 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 4 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk the cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs at december 31 2012 goodwill and intangibles amounted to 158 billion and 86 billion respectively and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to 14 billion in 2012 there were no impairments of goodwill in 2012 2011 or 2010 in 2012 and 2011 abbott recorded impairment charges of 82 million and 174 million respectively for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects 

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 450 contingencies under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes 

known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 70 million to 100 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures accruals of approximately 80 million have been recorded at december 31 2012 for these proceedings and exposures these accruals represent managements best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 contingencies 

results of operations 

sales 

the following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last three years 



total net sales in 2012 reflect unit growth partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange the decrease in 2012 vascular products sales is partially due to the winding down of royalty and supply agreements related to certain thirdparty products including promus excluding this royalty and supply agreement revenue in both periods and the unfavorable effect of exchange vascular products sales 

increased 34 percent in 2012 in 2011 and 2010 total net total us total international proprietary pharmaceutical products segment and established pharmaceutical products segment sales reflect the acquisition of solvays pharmaceuticals business on february 15 2010 and unit growth while the relatively weaker us dollar favorably impacted international sales across all segments total net total international and established pharmaceutical products segment sales growth in 2011 also reflects the acquisition of piramal healthcare limiteds healthcare solution business in september 2010 

a comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 



nm — percent change is not meaningful 

1 other coronary products include primarily guidewires and balloon catheters endovascular includes vessel closure carotid stents and other peripheral products 

excluding the negative effect of exchange total international proprietary sales increased 89 percent in 2012 in proprietary pharmaceuticals a generic version of tricor entered the us market in the fourth quarter of 2012 total established pharmaceutical products sales decreased in 2012 due to the negative effect of exchange and decreased sales of clarithromycin and serc due to in part pricing pressures in europe partially offset by growth in emerging markets excluding the effect of exchange total established pharmaceutical products sales increased 21 percent us pediatric nutritional sales in 2012 reflect market share gains for similac and unit growth for pediasure the increase in 2012 us adult nutritional sales reflects unit growth for the ensure and glucerna products international pediatric and adult nutritionals sales increases over the three years were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries and were negatively impacted in 2012 by the effect of the relatively stronger us dollar 

the increases in us proprietary product sales in 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to increased sales of humira and the acquisition of solvay pharmaceuticals in february 2010 partially offset by decreased sales of depakote zemplar and kaletra  the increases in established pharmaceutical sales in 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to the acquisitions of solvay pharmaceuticals and piramal and growth in emerging markets us pediatric nutritionals sales in 2011 and 2010 were affected by the voluntary recall of certain similacbrand powder infant formulas in september 2010 and the subsequent recovery in market share in 2011 international proprietary pharmaceuticals international adult nutritionals and immunochemistry sales were positively impacted by the effect of the relatively weaker us dollar in 2011 and 2010 abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were approximately 58 million in 2010 while there were no significant sales in 2012 and 2011 

the expiration of licenses and patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to affect abbott after the separation of abbvie 

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 621 percent of net sales in 2012 600 percent in 2011 and 583 percent in 2010 the increase in the gross profit margin in 2012 was impacted by improved gross margins across all reportable segments as a result of cost reduction initiatives the impact of exchange and favorable product mix the increase in the gross profit margin in 2011 was due in part to improved margins in the established pharmaceutical diagnostics and diabetes businesses and was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of exchange on the profit margin ratio the increase in the gross profit margin in 2010 was due in part to improved margins in the established pharmaceutical vascular diabetes diagnostics and nutritional businesses and the favorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio 

in the us states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products in numerous countries these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional proprietary pharmaceutical and established pharmaceutical products segments 

research and development expense was 4322 billion in 2012 4129 billion in 2011 and 3724 billion in 2010 and represented increases of 47 percent in 2012 109 percent in 2011 and 357 percent in 2010 excluding charges related to the solvay restructurings announced in september 2010 research and development expense increased 62 percent in 2011 and 294 percent in 2010 the 2010 increase exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges reflects the acquisitions of solvays pharmaceuticals business in february 2010 and facet biotech in april 2010 the increases in 2012 2011 and 2010 also reflect continued pipeline spending including programs in biologics hepatitis c and diagnostics the majority of research and development expenditures over the three years were 

concentrated on pharmaceutical products 29 billion of abbotts 2012 research and development expenses related to abbotts pharmaceutical products of which 22 billion was directly allocated to the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment in 2012 research and development expenditures totaled 367 million for the vascular products segment 382 million for the diagnostics products segment 275 million for the established pharmaceutical products segment and 186 million for the nutritional products segment 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 55 percent in 2012 and increased 229 percent in 2011 and 234 percent in 2010 2012 includes approximately 405 million related to the separation of abbvie from abbott and a 100 million litigation charge related to the government investigation related to depakote while 2011 includes a litigation charge of 15 billion related to the depakote investigation excluding separation costs litigation charges and solvayrelated restructuring and integration costs selling general and administrative expenses increased 46 percent in 2012 and 67 percent in 2011 excluding charges related to solvay restructuring and integration projects selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 182 percent this increase exclusive of the effects of the restructuring and integration charges reflects the acquisitions of solvays pharmaceuticals business in 2010 and advanced medical optics inc in 2009 and higher provisions for litigation in 2010 the remaining increases in selling general and administrative expenses over the three year period were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products including continued spending for humira inflation and in 2011 the impact of the pharmaceutical fee imposed by us healthcare reform legislation 

restructurings 

in 2012 abbott management approved plans to streamline various commercial operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in abbotts core diagnostics established pharmaceutical and nutritionals businesses abbott recorded employee related severance charges of approximately 167 million in 2012 additional charges of approximately 22 million were also recorded in 2012 primarily for asset impairments approximately 70 million is recorded in cost of products sold and approximately 119 million as selling general and administrative expense as of december 31 2012 no significant cash payments have been made relating to these actions 

in 2011 and prior years abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs in 2011 and 2010 abbott recorded charges of approximately 194 million and 56 million respectively reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets employee severance and other related charges approximately 76 million in 2011 is classified as cost of products sold 69 million as research and development and 49 million as selling general and administrative approximately 56 million in 2010 is classified as cost of products sold the following summarizes the activity for these restructurings dollars in millions 



an additional 110 million 25 million and 13 million were recorded in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively relating to these restructurings primarily for accelerated depreciation 

in 2012 and 2010 abbott management approved restructuring plans primarily related to the acquisition of solvays pharmaceuticals business these plans streamline operations improve efficiencies and reduce costs in certain solvay sites and functions as well as in certain abbott and solvay commercial organizations in various countries in 2012 abbott recorded a charge of approximately 150 million for employee severance and contractual obligations primarily related to the exit from a research and development facility approximately 142 million is recorded as research and development and 8 million as selling general and administrative in 2010 abbott recorded charges to cost of products sold research and development and selling general and administrative of approximately 99 million 152 million and 272 million respectively the following summarizes the activity for these restructurings dollars in millions 



an additional 38 million 102 million and 12 million were recorded in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively relating to these restructurings primarily for additional employee severance and accelerated depreciation 

in 2011 and 2008 abbott management approved plans to streamline global manufacturing operations reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in abbotts core diagnostic business in 2011 a charge of 28 million was recorded in cost of products sold the following summarizes the activity for these restructurings dollars in millions 



in addition charges of approximately 16 million 42 million and 60 million were recorded in 2012 2011 and 2010 primarily for accelerated depreciation and product transfer costs 

interest expense and interest income 

in 2012 interest expense increased primarily due to bridge facility fees related to the separation of abbvie from abbott in 2011 interest expense decreased due to lower debt levels interest income in 2012 and 2011 decreased as a result of lower rates in 2010 interest expense increased due primarily to increased debt levels interest income decreased in 2010 due to lower investment balances 

change in accounting principle and other income expense net 

prior to january 1 2011 the accounts of foreign subsidiaries were consolidated based on a fiscal year ended november 30 due to the time needed to consolidate these subsidiaries effective january 1 2011 the one month lag in the consolidation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries was eliminated and the yearend of foreign subsidiaries was changed to december 31 abbott believes that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the one month reporting lag is preferable because it results in more contemporaneous reporting of the results of foreign subsidiaries in accordance with applicable accounting literature a change in subsidiaries yearend is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application the cumulative effect of the change was an increase in retained earnings of 289 million as of january 1 2009 and a corresponding decrease in other longterm liabilities the impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after january 1 2009 and thus those results have not been revised a charge of 137 million was recorded to other income expense net in 2011 to recognize the cumulative immaterial impacts to 2009 and 2010 had the financial statements been revised net sales operating earnings and net earnings in 2010 would have decreased by 21 million 195 million and 175 million respectively 

other income expense net for 2012 includes income of approximately 60 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement and a loss of approximately 62 million for the impairment of certain equity securities other income expense net for 2011 includes 56 million of fair value adjustments and accretion in the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of solvays pharmaceutical business other income expense net for 2012 2011 and 2010 also includes ongoing contractual payments from takeda associated with the conclusion of the tap joint venture 

net loss on extinguishment of debt 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 abbott extinguished 77 billion of longterm debt abbott incurred a cost of 135 billion to extinguish this debt net of gains from the unwinding of interest rate swaps related to the debt 

taxes on earnings 

the income tax rates on earnings were 48 percent in 2012 90 percent in 2011 and 190 percent in 2010 taxes on earnings in 2012 reflect the 493 million effect of the tax rate applied to abbotts net debt extinguishment loss as well as the recognition of 408 million of tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to a prior year which also decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 560 million taxes on earnings in 2011 reflect the effect of the tax rate applied to a litigation reserve and the recognition of 580 million of tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years which also decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 13 billion exclusive of these discrete items the effective rates are lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to the benefit of lower foreign tax rates and tax exemptions that reduced the tax rates by 249 229 and 194 percentage points in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the tax rate reductions are primarily derived from operations in puerto rico switzerland ireland and singapore where abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules tax rulings grants and exemptions see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate 

as a result of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 signed into law in january 2013 abbott expects to record a tax benefit of approximately 100 million in the first quarter of 2013 for the retroactive extension of the research tax credit and the lookthrough rules of section 954c6 of the internal revenue code to the beginning of 2012 excluding this and any other discrete items abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of approximately 21 percent 

as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act which were signed into law in 2010 abbott recorded a charge of approximately 60 million in 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy 

in october 2010 puerto rico enacted legislation that assesses a tax beginning in 2011 on certain products manufactured in puerto rico the tax is levied on gross intercompany purchases from puerto rican entities and is included in inventory costs in 2012 and 2011 cost of goods sold included 187 million and 111 million respectively related to this tax the tax is creditable for us income tax purposes 

research and development programs 

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical and nutritional products in development 

research and development process 

in the proprietary pharmaceuticals segment the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

• phase i — involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers to assess tolerability and potential dosing • phase ii — tests the molecules efficacy against the disease in a small group of patients • phase iii — tests a molecule that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit a new drug application nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the us food and drug administration fda or similar government agencies outside the us the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 

the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8  12 years and can be even longer there is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products and new formulations proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include phase iv trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segments existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity 

depending upon the product the phases of development may include 

• drug product development 39 

• phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceuticals brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api • phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients • phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use • phase iv and other postmarketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations new indications or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china 

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include 

• discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need • conceptfeasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility and • development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses as with pharmaceutical products the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fdas premarketing approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a bla 

in the eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which is governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive other products only require a selfcertification process 

in the vascular segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design completion of clinical trials to test the products safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications 

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us vascular products are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbotts vascular products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 

in the eu vascular products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which is governed by the european medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive some products require submission of a design dossier to 

the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 

after approval and commercial launch of some vascular products postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants athletes or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a products efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted most other product development such as a product form change from liquid to powder generally does not necessitate clinical studies 

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fdas confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutrition products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products 

areas of focus 

in 2013 and beyond abbotts significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following 

established pharmaceuticals — abbott is actively working on plans for about 20  30 key brands depending on the product the development activities focus on new data markets formulations combinations or indications abbott focuses on building countryspecific portfolios made up of global and local pharmaceutical brands that best meet each local markets needs over the next several years established pharmaceuticals will work to expand the market for many of its products through registrations across multiple geographies including key emerging markets 

vascular — ongoing projects in the pipeline include 

• xience xpedition  our nextgeneration drugeluting stent des with enhanced deliverability and an expanded size matrix it utilizes the xience prime stent everolimus and biocompatible coating technology but incorporates new catheter technology for improved deliverability xience xpedition received us regulatory approval in december 2012 and is also available in europe and parts of asia and latin america abbott expects to launch the product in additional markets in 2013 • absorb the worlds first drug eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold bvs device for the treatment of coronary artery disease that is gradually resorbed into the vessel wall in january 2013 abbott initiated the absorb iii clinical trial which is designed to enroll approximately 2250 patients of which the majority will be in the us the data from this trial will be used to support the us regulatory filing of absorb in 2011 abbott released fiveyear data from its absorb clinical trial which showed efficacy and safety results consistent with the fouryear data in 2011 after receiving ce mark approval for absorb abbott initiated a randomized controlled clinical trial to further study the device in an expanded population in europe in 2010 abbott initiated the absorb extend clinical trial which will enroll up to 1000 patients with more complex coronary artery disease 41 

• mitraclip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation — abbotts mitraclip system which is on the market in europe and in parts of asia and latin america is currently under review for approval by the fda an amended filing to the fda was submitted in december 2011 a fda panel is expected to review the filing in the first half of 2013 • coronary and endovascular core product projects including new coronary and endovascular guide wires the absolute pro and omnilink elite stent systems both for the treatment of iliac artery disease a form of peripheral artery disease that affects the lower extremities were launched in the us in 2012 medical optics — abbott is developing a number of new products for patients undergoing cataract surgery which are designed to improve physician efficiency and patient outcomes abbott has developed advanced intraocular lenses iols that address astigmatism as well as presbyopia the tecnis brand monofocal toric iol which is sold in europe is currently undergoing us regulatory review a multifocal version of the toric iol was launched in a number of international markets in 2012 a preloaded iol insertion system that is designed to improve surgeon efficiency is also currently under regulatory review in the us the product was launched in europe in 2012 abbott is continuing the development activities required to obtain us approval for an enhanced version of the synchrony iol which is designed to mimic the eyes natural ability to change focus and deliver improved vision at all distances this product was launched in europe in late 2012 abbott has also developed a new diagnostic instrument and laser treatment planning software which is designed to improve visual outcomes after the receipt of ce mark approval in november 2011 this instrument and software were launched in europe in 2012 a pma filing for us regulatory approval of this product was submitted in 2012 

molecular diagnostics — various new molecular in vitro diagnostic ivd products including oncology and infectious disease assays and a next generation instrument system are in various stages of development and commercialization abbotts companion diagnostic test for an alk gene rearrangement test for nonsmallcell lung cancer has been approved in more than 40 countries around the world in 2012 companion diagnostic efforts were expanded to include collaborative efforts with multiple major pharmaceutical companies in the us an assay to genotype hcvinfected patients to aid in the choice of an appropriate therapy was submitted for regulatory approval additional assays for infectious diseases including mtb and mtb drug resistance are in development 

core laboratory diagnostics — abbott is working on the development of assays in various areas including infectious disease cardiac care fertility and metabolics and on nextgeneration blood screening hematology and immunochemistry instrument systems abbott is also focusing on nearterm launches of automation solutions such as its nextgeneration track system accelerator a3600 to increase efficiency in laboratories 

diabetes care — in the first quarter of 2012 abbott obtained us regulatory approval for its freestyle insulinx blood glucose monitoring system that includes a touchscreen interface and other features designed to support the insulinusing patient after receiving ce mark for this system in may 2011 and health canada approval in october 2011 abbott is continuing to provide rd support as the product is launched in additional markets development is also continuing on an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system for which a filing for approval is projected to be submitted in the us during the first half of 2013 abbott is also developing a nextgeneration monitoring system under the precision product platform and for which abbott anticipates submitting filings for approval in various markets in the second half of 2013 

nutrition — abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric adult and performance nutrition areas immunity cognition lean body mass inflammation metabolism and tolerance numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched over the coming years 

given the diversity of abbotts business its intention to remain a broadbased healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbotts overall market position there were no delays in abbotts 2012 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbotts ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development after the separation of abbvie abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each year abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period 

business combinations technology acquisitions and related transactions 

on september 8 2010 abbott acquired piramal healthcare limiteds healthcare solutions business a leader in the indian branded generics market for 22 billion in cash plus additional payments of 400 million annually in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 abbott recorded a 16 billion liability for the present value of the additional payments at the acquisition date the acquisition was financed with cash the allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in the recording of 27 billion of deductible acquired intangible assets and 10 billion of deductible goodwill acquired intangible assets consist primarily of trade names customer relationships and associated rights and are amortized over an average of 19 years

goodwill 

at december 31 2012 goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled 158 billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the medical optics unit while the fair value of the medical optics business exceeds its carrying value extended economic pressure on governmentreimbursed cataract procedures in europe and on the global lasik surgery business as well as longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development could result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the medical optics unit has declined below its carrying value thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment 

financial condition 

cash flow 

net cash from operating activities amounted to 93 billion 90 billion and 87 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively trade accounts payable and other liabilities in net cash from operating activities in 2012 includes the payment of approximately 15 billion related to a litigation accrual recorded in 2011 this was partially offset by increases in other liabilities primarily restructuring reserves income taxes payable in 2012 and 2011 includes 408 million and 580 million respectively of tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years while substantially all cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2012 that will be retained by abbott after the separation and all cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2011 and 2010 is considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbott believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2012 can be considered to be reinvested indefinitely abbott funded 379 million in 2012 394 million in 2011 and 525 million in 2010 to defined pension plans abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of 170 million in 2013 the decrease primarily reflects the separation of abbvie and the transfer of certain plan assets and liabilities to abbvie abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends 

for 2010 the reductions in cash and cash equivalents due to the effect of exchange rate changes was primarily driven by the impact of changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the euro on nondollar denominated cash and cash equivalents while future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies could have a substantial effect on the dollar value of abbotts cash and cash equivalents such fluctuations are not expected to materially impact abbotts liquidity 

debt and capital 

at december 31 2012 abbotts longterm debt rating was a by standard  poors corporation and a1 by moodys investors service in 2012 abbott replaced unused lines of credit of 30 billion and 37 billion that were to expire in october 2012 and in 2013 respectively with two fiveyear credit facilities totaling 70 billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements one of the credit facilities totaling 20 billion will support abbvie commercial paper borrowings after separation and expired for abbott at the separation of abbvie from abbott on january 1 2013 

in 2012 abbott redeemed 77 billion of longterm notes in preparation for the separation of abbvie from abbott and repaid 1 billion of longterm notes that were due in 2012 in addition abbvie inc a wholly owned subsidiary of abbott issued 147 billion of longterm notes that were guaranteed by abbott until abbvies separation from abbott on january 1 2013 in 2011 abbott repaid 20 billion of longterm notes using primarily shortterm borrowings under a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in february 2009 abbott issued 30 billion of longterm debt in the second quarter of 2010 with maturity dates in 2015 2020 and 2040 and interest rates of 27 percent 4125 percent and 53 percent respectively the debt due in 2015 was extinguished in 2012 proceeds from this debt were used to pay down shortterm borrowings 

in october 2008 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 5 billion of abbotts common shares from time to time under this authorization 370 million and 148 million shares were purchased in 2012 and 2010 at a cost of approximately 22 billion and 800 million respectively no shares were purchased under this authorization in 2011 abbott plans to purchase shares from time to time in 2013 

the judgment entered in 2009 by the us district court for the eastern district of texas against abbott in its litigation with new york university and centocor inc required abbott to secure the judgment in the event that its appeal to the federal circuit court was unsuccessful in overturning the district courts decision in the first quarter of 2010 abbott deposited 187 billion with an escrow agent and considered these assets to be restricted on february 23 2011 the federal circuit reversed the district courts final judgment and found centocors patent invalid on april 25 2011 centocor petitioned the federal circuit to rehear and reconsider the decision in june 2011 the federal circuit denied centocors petition and the restrictions on the funds were lifted 

working capital 

working capital was 180 billion at december 31 2012 83 billion at december 31 2011 and 51 billion at december 31 2010 the increase in working capital in 2012 was due primarily to higher cash generated from operating activities and higher cash and investments as a result of the net issuance of longterm debt in connection with the separation of abbvie from abbott the increase in working capital in 2011 was due primarily to higher cash generated from operating activities and lower debt levels the decrease in working capital in 2010 was due primarily to cash and investments used to acquire solvays pharmaceuticals business and piramal healthcare limiteds healthcare solutions business 

substantially all of abbotts trade receivables in italy spain portugal and greece are with governmental health systems given the economic conditions and sovereign debt issues in these countries the time it takes to collect outstanding receivables increased in 2011 in 2012 collection times improved 

relative to 2011 with the exception of greece outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at december 31 2012 were  dollars in millions  



with the exception of greece abbott historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries abbott continues to monitor the credit worthiness of customers located in these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected in addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments in these countries abbott regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbott also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbott may not be able to collect the entire balance 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures of 18 billion in 2012 15 billion in 2011 and 10 billion in 2010 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing research and development and administrative support facilities in all segments investments in information technology and laboratory instruments placed with customers 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 the amounts do not reflect the separation of abbvie from abbott on january 1 2013 after the separation of abbvie from abbott on january 1 2013 principal payments required on longterm debt outstanding and retained by abbott are 309 million in 2013 and 33 billion in 2019 and thereafter payments on longterm debt to be made by abbvie including interest total approximately 196 billion 



a purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements b unrecognized tax benefits totaling 20 billion are excluded from the table above as abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items 

contingent obligations 

abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business such as assignment of product rights with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these obligations based upon past experience the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote in addition abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events 

legislative issues 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively referred to herein as health care reform legislation were signed into law in the us health care reform legislation included an increase in the basic medicaid rebate rate from 151 percent to 231 percent and extended the rebate to drugs provided through medicaid managed care organizations 

beginning in 2013 health care reform legislation will eliminate the federal income tax deduction for prescription drug expenses of retirees for which abbott receives reimbursement under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program as a result abbott recorded a charge of approximately 60 million in the first quarter 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities 

in 2011 abbott began recording the annual fee imposed by health care reform legislation on companies that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs the amount of the annual fee is based on the ratio of certain of abbotts sales as compared to the total such sales of all covered entities multiplied by a fixed dollar amount specified in the legislation by year in 2011 additional rebates were incurred related to the medicare part d coverage gap donut hole beginning in 2013 abbott will record the 23 percent excise tax imposed by health care reform legislation on the sale of certain medical devices in the us 

abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors to the annual report on form 10k 

private securities litigation reform act of 1995 — a caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 abbott cautions investors that any forwardlooking statements or projections made by abbott including those made in this document are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect abbotts operations are discussed in item 1a risk factors to the annual report on form 10k

information with respect to abbotts business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to abbotts operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and abroad there have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages 

patents trademarks and licenses 

abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for abbotts products in the united states and all countries of major marketing interest to abbott abbott owns and is licensed under a substantial number of patents and patent applications principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the narrative description of business on pages 1 through 6 these and various patents which expire during the period 2012 to 2031 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbotts business abbott believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira® are material in relation to abbotts business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patents covering adalimumab will expire in december 2016 in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant for abbotts pharmaceutical products segment those related to lopinavirritonavir which is sold under the trademarks kaletra® and aluvia™ those related to fenofibrate which is sold under the trademarks tricor® and trilipix® those related to niacin which is sold under the trademarks niaspan® and simcor® and those related to testosterone which is sold under the trademark androgel® the united states composition of matter patent covering lopinavir will expire in 2016 the united states noncomposition of matter patent covering lopinavirritonavir will expire in 2016 the principal united states noncomposition of matter patents covering the fenofibrate products will expire in 2018 2020 2023 and 2025 the principal united states noncomposition of matter patents covering the niacin products will expire in 2013 2017 and 2018 the principal noncomposition of matter patent covering androgel® will expire in 2020 for the 162 formulation and due to pediatric exclusivity in 2021 for the 1 formulation litigation related to the products listed above is discussed in legal proceedings on pages 17 through 21 agreements that may affect exclusivity are discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations on pages 28 through 50 

although the expiration of a composition of matter patent may lead to increased competition in most cases abbott owns or has a license to other patents that expire after the composition of matter patent related to particular formulations uses or processes for manufacturing the pharmaceutical these noncomposition of matter patents and abbotts other intellectual property along with such other factors as a competitors need to obtain regulatory approvals prior to marketing a competitive product and the nature of the market may allow abbott to continue to have commercial advantages after the expiration of the composition of matter patent including in some instances exclusivity 

seasonal aspects customers backlog and renegotiation 

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbotts business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott orders for abbotts products are 

generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbotts business no material portion of abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

research and development 

abbott spent 4129414000 in 2011 3724424000 in 2010 and 2743733000 in 2009 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes the majority of research and development expenditures is concentrated on proprietary pharmaceutical products 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2011 were approximately 14 million and 60 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2012 are estimated to be 7 million and 64 million respectively 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency epa or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 91000 persons as of december 31 2011 

regulation 

the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various federal state and local agencies both domestic and international addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbotts international operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by local and international laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide among other things guidance on corporate interactions with government officials in addition abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights and control the entrance of multisource drugs for small molecule and generic biologic medicines 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbotts business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbotts business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of marketing of such products domestically or globally and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbott expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of healthcare products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing domestic and foreign budgetary pressures may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbotts products for the foreseeable future 

specifically us federal laws requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbotts proprietary pharmaceutical business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 requires manufacturers to extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the department of veterans affairs department of defense public health service entities and institutions as well as certain other covered entities the act also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to designated health care facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products end stage renal disease treatment is covered through a bundled payment that likewise creates incentives for providers to control costs medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for medicine delivered under part d 

in march 2010 congress enacted the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act under the affordable care act abbott pays a fee related to its pharmaceutical sales to government programs also in 2011 abbott began providing a discount of 50 percent for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole in 2013 manufacturers are scheduled to begin paying an 

excise tax on sales of medical devices medicare is also implementing a competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment enteral nutrition products and supplies 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs biologics devices and medical supplies covered under medicare and medicaid starting in 2012 to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data beginning in 2013 to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

in the united states governmental cost containment efforts also affect abbotts nutrition business under regulations governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula as a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program 

abbott expects debate to continue during 2012 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

abbott is a party to a consent decree entered in 1999 that requires abbott to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing processes in lake county illinois conform to the us food and drug administrations fda quality system regulation and restricts the sale in the united states of certain products in the diagnostic products segment in 2003 the fda concluded that those operations were in substantial conformity with the quality system regulation 

international operations 

abbott markets products worldwide through affiliates and distributors most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the united states in addition certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the united states international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbotts securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbotts actual results abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbotts future revenues and operating income 

many of abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbotts intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbotts business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbotts intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced abbotts principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in the sections captioned patents trademarks and licenses and financial review and litigation regarding these patents is described in the section captioned legal proceedings 

abbott faces increasing competition from lowercost generic products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes that may significantly reduce abbotts sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbotts competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on its revenues margins business and results of operations 

competitors intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of 

affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

abbott is subject to costcontainment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned regulation to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to healthcare or other factors abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns many of abbotts facilities and procedures and those of abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbotts products and criminal prosecution these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbotts business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbotts facilities while abbott or abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbotts industry is also subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbotts business 

a number of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement the laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries future rulemaking could increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or require additional reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking 

abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbotts revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbotts products to become obsolete causing abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer 

the proposed separation of abbott into two publiclytraded companies may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

unforeseen developments including possible delays in obtaining various tax regulatory and works council approvals or clearances could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable andor different than expected expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than abbott currently anticipates following the proposed separation the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of abbotts common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred 

new products and technological advances by abbotts competitors may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

abbotts products face intense competition from its competitors products competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbotts products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbotts business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

significant safety issues could arise for abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and financial condition 

health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety issues arise with an abbott product sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbotts products 

in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbotts business and reputation and on abbotts ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income or exposure to other claims product liability losses are generally selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

further deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain european countries may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

if economic conditions in certain european countries including greece portugal italy and spain continue to worsen the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables may increase financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs including health care at the same time ongoing sovereign debt issues including the impact of recent credit downgrades could increase abbotts collection risk given that a significant amount of abbotts receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems 

the international nature of abbotts business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbotts business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally sales outside of the united states make up approximately 60 percent of abbotts net sales the risks associated with abbotts operations outside the united states include 

• changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs • multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict abbotts ability to manufacture market and sell its products • differing local product preferences and product requirements • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations • differing labor regulations • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws • political and economic instability including sovereign debt issues • price and currency exchange controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action • inflation recession and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates and • compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbotts profitability and its financial condition including 

• differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value particularly for pensions retiree health care stock compensation intangibles and goodwill and for contingent liabilities such as litigation the absence of a recorded amount or an amount recorded at the minimum compared to the actual amount • changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements product marketing application standards and environmental laws in domestic or foreign jurisdictions • changes in the rate of inflation including the cost of raw materials commodities and supplies interest rates market value of abbotts equity investments and the performance of investments held by abbott or abbotts employee benefit trusts • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to abbott or abbotts employee benefit trusts • changes in business economic and political conditions including war political instability terrorist attacks in the us and other parts of the world the threat of future terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related military action natural disasters the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events labor disputes strikes slowdowns or other forms of labor or union activity and pressure from thirdparty interest groups 14 

• changes in abbotts business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies changing product mix changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the us and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future • changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor retailer or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions pricing seasonality or other factors or other problems with licensors suppliers distributors and business partners • difficulties related to abbotts information technology systems any of which could adversely affect business operations including any significant breakdown invasion destruction loss of data privacy or interruption of these systems • changes in credit markets impacting abbotts ability to obtain financing for its business operations • legal difficulties any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations adverse litigation decisions and issues regarding compliance with any governmental consent decree or agreements cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements

most of these rebates and allowances are in the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment and the nutritional products segment abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies state agencies that administer the federal medicaid program insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to 24 months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 amounted to approximately 55 billion 49 billion and 44 billion respectively or 222 percent 231 percent and 238 percent respectively based on gross sales of approximately 248 billion 211 billion and 184 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 248 million in 2011 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 409 million 415 million and 414 million for cash discounts in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and 490 million 537 million and 456 million for returns in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbotts historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management has access to several large customers inventory management data and for other customers utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data in addition internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the states and internally administered market research the usda has been making its data available for many years internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data at december 31 2011 abbott had the exclusive wic business in 23 states 

in the domestic proprietary pharmaceutical business the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data to estimate the price rebate percentage systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant and abbott believes they are reliable 

the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals which comprise approximately 68 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2011 remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings  dollars in millions  



historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for medicaid medicare and other government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items are often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbotts federal income tax returns through 2008 are settled except for one item and the income tax returns for years after 2008 are open abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for decades can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs low asset returns due to poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2011 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 38 billion and 237 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service 

attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 4 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk the cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs at december 31 2011 goodwill and intangibles amounted to 157 billion and 100 billion respectively and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to 16 billion in 2011 there were no impairments of goodwill in 2011 2010 or 2009 in 2011 abbott recorded impairment charges of 174 million for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects 

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 450 contingencies under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 159 billion to 163 billion for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures reserves of approximately 16 billion have been recorded at december 31 2011 for these proceedings and exposures these reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 contingencies 

results of operations 

sales 

the following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last three years 



in 2011 and 2010 total net total us total international proprietary pharmaceutical products segment and established pharmaceutical products segment sales reflect the acquisition of solvays pharmaceuticals business on february 15 2010 and unit growth while the relatively weaker us dollar favorably impacted international sales across all segments total net total international and established 

pharmaceutical products segment sales growth in 2011 also reflects the acquisition of piramal healthcare limiteds healthcare solution business in september 2010 total net sales growth in 2009 reflects unit growth and the acquisition of advanced medical optics inc on february 25 2009 partially offset by the negative effect of the relatively stronger us dollar total net total us and proprietary pharmaceutical products segment sales in 2009 also reflect decreased sales of depakote due to generic competition excluding us depakote sales total net sales increased 77 percent total us sales increased 76 percent and proprietary pharmaceutical products segment sales increased 78 percent from 2008 to 2009 

a comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 



nm — percent change is not meaningful 

the increases in us proprietary product sales in 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to increased sales of humira and the acquisition of solvay pharmaceuticals in february 2010 partially offset by decreased 

sales of depakote and zemplar  us proprietary product sales in 2009 were impacted by decreased sales of depakote due to generic competition partially offset by increased sales of humira and the addition of lupron sales from the conclusion of the tap joint venture in april 2008 us sales of depakote were 148 million 161 million and 331 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively worldwide sales of kaletra in all three years were negatively affected by market competition international proprietary product sales in all three years were favorably impacted by increased sales of humira  the increases in established pharmaceutical sales in 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to the acquisitions of solvay pharmaceuticals and piramal and growth in emerging markets us pediatric nutritionals sales in 2011 and 2010 were affected by the voluntary recall of certain similacbrand powder infant formulas in september 2010 and the subsequent recovery in market share in 2011 international pediatric and adult nutritionals sales increases over the three years were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries international proprietary pharmaceuticals international adult nutritionals and immunochemistry sales in 2011 and 2010 were positively impacted by the effect of the relatively weaker us dollar and were negatively impacted in 2009 by the effect of the relatively stronger us dollar abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were approximately 58 million and 120 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively while there were no significant sales in 2011 

the expiration of licenses patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years under a license agreement for tricor 145 mg generic competition is not expected before july 2012 under a license agreement for trilipix 45 mg and 135 mg generic competition may begin in january 2014 except that under certain circumstances the license may commence as early as july 2013 under an agreement relating to abbotts niacin products and acquired with the kos pharmaceuticals acquisition niaspan may become subject to generic competition in september 2013 androgel 1 sales are expected to be impacted by generic competition in 2015 

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 600 percent of net sales in 2011 583 percent in 2010 and 571 percent in 2009 the increase in the gross profit margin in 2011 was due in part to improved margins in the established pharmaceutical diagnostics and diabetes businesses and was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of exchange on the profit margin ratio the increase in the gross profit margin in 2010 was due in part to improved margins in the established pharmaceutical vascular diabetes diagnostics and nutritional businesses and the favorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio the decrease in the gross profit margin in 2009 was due in part to the negative impact from lower sales of depakote and the unfavorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio partially offset by improved margins in the vascular and diagnostics businesses 

in the us states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional proprietary pharmaceutical and established pharmaceutical products segments 

research and development expense was 4129 billion in 2011 3724 billion in 2010 and 2744 billion in 2009 and represented increases of 109 percent in 2011 357 percent in 2010 and 20 percent in 2009 excluding charges related to the solvay restructurings announced in september 2010 research and development expense increased 294 percent in 2010 and 62 percent in 2011 the 2010 increase exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges reflects the acquisitions of solvays pharmaceuticals business in february 2010 and facet biotech in april 2010 the increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009 excluding 

the effect of exchange research and development expenses increased 34 percent in 2009 the increases in 2011 2010 and 2009 also reflect continued pipeline spending including programs in vascular devices biologics neuroscience oncology and hepatitis c the majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products 28 billion of abbotts 2011 research and development expenses related to abbotts pharmaceutical products of which 22 billion was directly allocated to the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment in 2011 research and development expenditures totaled 403 million for the vascular products segment 325 million for the diagnostics products segment 251 million for the established pharmaceutical products segment and 165 million for the nutritional products segment 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 229 percent in 2011 increased 234 percent in 2010 and decreased 04 percent in 2009 the us department of justice through the united states attorney for the western district of virginia is investigating abbotts sales and marketing activities for depakote  in 2011 abbott recorded a litigation charge of 15 billion related to ongoing settlement discussions in this investigation excluding the litigation charge and solvayrelated restructuring and integration costs selling general and administrative expenses increased 67 percent in 2011 excluding charges related to solvay restructuring and integration projects selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 182 percent this increase exclusive of the effects of the restructuring and integration charges reflects the acquisitions of solvays pharmaceuticals business in 2010 and advanced medical optics inc in 2009 and higher provisions for litigation in 2010 the 2009 decrease reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which was offset by expenses relating to the acquisition of advanced medical optics inc and the settlement of litigation excluding the effects of the charges and exchange selling general and administrative expenses increased 09 percent in 2009 the remaining increases in selling general and administrative expenses over the three year period were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products including continued spending for humira inflation and in 2010 the impact of the pharmaceutical fee imposed by us healthcare reform legislation 

restructurings 

in 2011 and prior years abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs in 2011 2010 and 2009 abbott recorded charges of approximately 194 million 56 million and 114 million respectively reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets employee severance and other related charges approximately 76 million in 2011 is classified as cost of products sold 69 million as research and development and 49 million as selling general and administrative approximately 56 million in 2010 is classified as cost of products sold and 114 million in 2009 as selling general and administrative the following summarizes the activity for these restructurings dollars in millions 



an additional 25 million 13 million and 47 million were recorded in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively relating to these restructurings primarily for accelerated depreciation 

in 2010 abbott management approved a restructuring plan primarily related to the acquisition of solvays pharmaceuticals business this plan streamlines operations improves efficiencies and reduces costs in certain solvay sites and functions as well as in certain abbott and solvay commercial organizations in various countries under this plan abbott recorded charges to cost of products sold research and development and selling general and administrative of approximately 99 million 152 million and 272 million respectively the following summarizes the activity for this restructuring dollars in millions 



an additional 102 million and 12 million were recorded in 2011 and 2010 respectively relating to this restructuring primarily for additional employee severance and accelerated depreciation 

in 2011 and 2008 abbott management approved plans to streamline global manufacturing operations reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in abbotts core diagnostic business in 2011 a charge of 28 million was recorded in cost of products sold the following summarizes the activity for these restructurings dollars in millions 



in addition charges of approximately 42 million 60 million and 54 million were recorded in 2011 2010 and 2009 primarily for accelerated depreciation and product transfer costs additional charges will be incurred through 2012 as a result of product reregistration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries and product transition timelines 

interest expense and interest income 

in 2011 interest expense decreased due to lower debt levels and interest income decreased as a result of lower rates in 2010 interest expense increased due primarily to increased debt levels in 2009 interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower interest rates partially offset by increased debt levels related to the acquisition of advanced medical optics inc interest income decreased in 2010 due to lower investment balances and decreased in 2009 due to lower interest rates 

change in accounting principle and other income expense net 

prior to january 1 2011 the accounts of foreign subsidiaries were consolidated based on a fiscal year ended november 30 due to the time needed to consolidate these subsidiaries effective january 1 2011 the one month lag in the consolidation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries was eliminated and the 

yearend of foreign subsidiaries was changed to december 31 abbott believes that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the one month reporting lag is preferable because it will result in more contemporaneous reporting of the results of foreign subsidiaries in accordance with applicable accounting literature a change in subsidiaries yearend is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application the cumulative effect of the change was an increase in retained earnings of 289 million as of january 1 2009 and a corresponding decrease in other longterm liabilities the impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after january 1 2009 and thus those results have not been revised a charge of 137 million was recorded to other income expense net in 2011 to recognize the cumulative immaterial impacts to 2009 and 2010 had the financial statements been revised net sales operating earnings and net earnings in 2009 would have increased by 211 million 36 million and 38 million respectively and net sales operating earnings and net earnings in 2010 would have decreased by 21 million 195 million and 175 million respectively 

other income expense net for 2011 includes 56 million of fair value adjustments and accretion in the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of solvays pharmaceutical business other income expense net for 2009 includes the derecognition of a contingent liability of 797 million associated with the conclusion of the tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture the contingent liability was established at the conclusion of the joint venture as abbott agreed to remit cash to takeda if certain research and development events were not achieved on the development assets retained by takeda in 2009 the research and development events were achieved and the contingent liability was derecognized in addition other income expense net for 2009 includes a 287 million gain from the settlement reached between abbott and medtronic inc resolving all outstanding intellectual property litigation between the two parties and income from the recording of certain investments at fair value in connection with business acquisitions other income expense net for 2011 2010 and 2009 also includes ongoing contractual payments from takeda associated with the conclusion of the tap joint venture 

taxes on earnings 

the income tax rates on earnings were 90 percent in 2011 190 percent in 2010 and 201 percent in 2009 taxes on earnings in 2011 reflect the effect of the tax rate applied to a litigation reserve and the recognition of 580 million of tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years which also decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 13 billion exclusive of these discrete items the effective rates are lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to the benefit of lower foreign tax rates and tax exemptions that reduced the tax rates by 229 194 and 164 percentage points in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the tax rate reductions are primarily derived from operations in puerto rico switzerland ireland and singapore where abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules tax rulings grants and exemptions see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate 

as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act which were signed into law in 2010 abbott recorded a charge of approximately 60 million in 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy the tax rate in 2009 was affected by a higher tax rate applied to the derecognition of a contingent liability associated with the conclusion of the tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture and the medtronic intellectual property litigation settlement 

in october 2010 puerto rico enacted legislation that assesses a tax beginning in 2011 on certain products manufactured in puerto rico this excise tax is recorded in cost of products sold although the tax is creditable for us income tax purposes 

research and development programs 

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical and nutritional products in development 

research and development process 

in the proprietary pharmaceuticals segment the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

• phase i — involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers to assess tolerability and potential dosing • phase ii — tests the molecules efficacy against the disease in a small group of patients • phase iii — tests a molecule that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit a new drug application nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the us food and drug administration fda or similar government agencies outside the us the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 

the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8  12 years and can be even longer there is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products and new formulations proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include phase iv trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

in the established pharmaceuticals segment the research and development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segments existing products to provide improved therapeutic benefits itbs to patients and customers as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity 

depending upon the product the phases of development may include 

• drug product development • phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceuticals brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api • phase ii studies to test the efficacy of an itb in a small group of patients • phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations and new indications 

in addition to the development of new itbs development projects may also include phase iv studies similar to the postmarketing studies described above for proprietary pharmaceuticals 

in the diagnostics segment the phases of the research and development process include 

• discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need • conceptfeasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility and • development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses as with pharmaceutical products the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions in the us the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products class ii devices typically require premarket notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510k submission most class iii products are subject to the fdas premarketing approval pma requirements other class iii products such as those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of a bla 

in the eu diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process which is governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company known as a notified body before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive other products only require a selfcertification process 

in the vascular segment the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program passes that hurdle it moves forward into development the development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design completion of clinical trials to test the products safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet predetermined specifications 

similar to the diagnostic products discussed above in the us vascular products are classified as class i ii or iii most of abbotts vascular products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 

in the eu vascular products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process which is governed by the european medical device directive varies by class each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other products the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can selfcertify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the us and the eu the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 

after approval and commercial launch of some vascular products postmarket trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 

in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg infants athletes or patients eg people with diabetes depending upon the country andor region if claims regarding a products efficacy will be made clinical studies typically must be conducted most 

other product development such as a product form change from liquid to powder generally does not necessitate clinical studies 

in the us the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change the company is required to obtain the fdas confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging for other nutrition products notification or preapproval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive in some countries regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products including infant formula and medical nutritional products 

areas of focus 

abbotts significant areas of therapeutic focus include the following

undergoing cataract surgery including the synchrony intraocular lens iol designed to mimic the eyes natural ability to change focus and deliver improved vision at all distances advanced iols that address astigmatism as well as presbyopia iol insertion systems that improve surgeon efficiency and enable implantation through smaller incision sizes and feature enhancements to phacoemulsification systems 

molecular diagnostics — numerous new molecular diagnostic products including oncology and infectious disease assays as well as a new instrument system are currently under development abbotts companion diagnostic test for an alk gene rearrangement test for nonsmallcell lung cancer was launched in the us in 2011 and is currently in clinical trials and undergoing regulatory review in numerous other countries in 2011 an assay to aid in the management of hcvinfected patients undergoing antiviral therapy received us regulatory approval and additional assays to detect the presence of hiv virus and cmv viral load as well as a test to detect hepatitis b drug resistance in patients received ce mark 

core laboratory diagnostics — abbott is researching dozens of novel biomarkers focusing on areas such as infectious disease oncology cardiac and neuroscience disorders and also has several nextgeneration instrument systems in development 

diabetes care — abbott submitted its freestyle insulinx blood glucose monitoring system that includes new features designed to support the insulinusing patient for regulatory approval in the us in june 2011 after receiving ce mark for this system in may 2011 and health canada approval in october 2011 abbott is continuing to provide rd support as the product is launched in additional markets development is also continuing on an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system for which filings for approval are projected to be submitted in the us and europe during the first half of 2013 abbott is also developing a nextgeneration monitoring system under the precision product platform abbott anticipates submitting filings for approval in various markets in 2013 

nutrition — abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric adult and performance nutrition areas immunity cognition lean body mass inflammation metabolism and tolerance numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched in 2012 

given the diversity of abbotts business its intention to remain a broadbased healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project compound or device over the next year relative to abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbotts overall market position there were no delays in abbotts 2011 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical and medical device projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbotts ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development however abbott plans to continue to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 95 percent to 10 percent of sales each year abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period 

generally abbott seeks to obtain various forms of exclusivity for each product in development abbott obtains patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development additionally abbott also seeks to obtain other forms of legal or regulatory 

exclusivity that would protect the product upon approval these forms of regulatory exclusivity have a variety of terms from 3 5 to 7 years in the united states and up to 10 years in the european union this regulatory exclusivity is granted upon the approval of each development project in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection the availability of and length of such regulatory exclusivity is based in part on the length of the regulatory review process and can only be determined upon product approval it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period of exclusivity that will be obtained if regulatory approval is obtained 

generally upon approval products in development may be entitled to exclusivity abbott seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states the expiration date for patents filed on or after june 8 1995 is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration may be significantly less than 20 years if a product in development ultimately obtains regulatory approval the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a patent term restoration for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the calculation of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time extending from the filing of an investigational new drug application to the submission of the nda plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed 5 years and the remaining patent term after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years only one patent related to the first commercial marketing of a newly approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for a patent term restoration 

additionally products may be entitled to obtain other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval these forms of regulatory exclusivity have a variety of terms in the united states and are variable in other jurisdictions in the united states when the fda approves a new chemical entity that it has not previously approved alone or in combination with other chemical entities the product is granted 5 years of regulatory exclusivity the fda may grant 3 years of market exclusivity for an nda including supplementary applications if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations that have not previously been relied upon by the fda if the fda grants pediatric exclusivity the longest existing exclusivity patent or regulatory related to the product would be extended by 6 months if the fda designates a product as an orphan drug that is either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may grant 7 years of exclusivity 

this regulatory exclusivity is granted upon the approval of each development project in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period of exclusivity that will be obtained if regulatory approval is obtained however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the minimum and maximum periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed 3 and 14 years respectively these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may provide some level of additional protection against generic incursion 

business combinations technology acquisitions and related transactions

goodwill 

at december 31 2011 goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled 157 billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the medical optics unit while the fair value of the medical optics business exceeds its carrying value extended economic pressure on governmentreimbursed cataract procedures in europe and on the global lasik surgery business as well as longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development could result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the medical optics unit has declined below its carrying value thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment 

financial condition 

cash flow 

net cash from operating activities amounted to 90 billion 87 billion and 73 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively trade accounts payable and other liabilities in net cash from operating activities in 2011 includes the noncash impact of a litigation reserve of 15 billion and income taxes payable includes 580 million of tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years while substantially all of abbotts cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 is considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the us abbott would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbott believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2011 can be considered to be reinvested indefinitely abbott funded 394 million in 2011 525 million in 2010 and 862 million in 2009 to defined pension plans abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of 200 million annually abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends 

for 2010 the reductions in cash and cash equivalents due to the effect of exchange rate changes was primarily driven by the impact of changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the euro on nondollar denominated cash and cash equivalents while future fluctuations in the strength of the us dollar against foreign currencies could have a substantial effect on the dollar value of abbotts cash and cash equivalents such fluctuations are not expected to materially impact abbotts liquidity 

as discussed above the united states department of justice through the united states attorney for the western district of virginia is investigating abbotts sales and marketing activities for depakote  abbott recorded a noncash charge of 15 billion in 2011 related to this investigation however the discussions to resolve potential civil and criminal claims related to this matter are ongoing and until 

concluded there can be no certainty about definitive resolution the ultimate resolution of this matter in any reporting period is expected to have a material impact on abbotts cash flows for that year 

debt and capital 

at december 31 2011 abbotts longterm debt rating was aa by standard  poors corporation and a1 by moodys investors service abbott has readily available financial resources including unused lines of credit of 67 billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements of which a 30 billion facility expires in october 2012 and a 37 billion facility expires in 2013 related compensating balances which are subject to withdrawal by abbott at its option and commitment fees are not material 

in october 2008 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 5 billion of abbotts common shares from time to time under this authorization 148 million and 145 million shares were purchased in 2010 and 2009 at a cost of approximately 800 million in both years no shares were purchased under this authorization in 2011 abbott plans to purchase shares from time to time in 2012 

in 2011 abbott repaid 2 billion of longterm notes using primarily shortterm borrowings under a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in february 2009 abbott issued 30 billion of longterm debt in the second quarter of 2010 that matures in 2015 2020 and 2040 with interest rates of 27 percent 4125 percent and 53 percent respectively proceeds from this debt were used to pay down shortterm borrowings abbott is in the process of evaluating the impact of the proposed separation on its future capitalization structure and liquidity in 2012 abbott expects to tender for a portion of its outstanding longterm debt with the tender funded by debt issued by the new pharmaceutical company under the february 2009 registration statement abbott issued 30 billion of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2009 that matures in 2019 and 2039 with interest rates of 5125 percent and 60 percent respectively proceeds from this debt were used to fund the acquisition of advanced medical optics inc and to repay debt of advanced medical optics inc in addition abbott repaid 1 billion of longterm notes that were due in 2009 using primarily shortterm borrowings

working capital 

working capital was 83 billion at december 31 2011 51 billion at december 31 2010 and 103 billion at december 31 2009 the increase in working capital in 2011 was due primarily to higher cash generated from operating activities and lower debt levels the decrease in working capital in 2010 was due primarily to cash and investments used to acquire solvays pharmaceuticals business and piramal healthcare limiteds healthcare solutions business 

a significant amount of abbotts trade receivables in greece portugal italy and spain are with governmental health systems given the economic conditions and sovereign debt issues in these countries the time it takes to collect outstanding receivables increased in 2011 outstanding net governmental receivables in these four countries totaled 173 billion 150 billion and 159 billion at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the percentage of governmental receivables in these four countries over a year past due was 27 percent 22 percent and 23 percent at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively with the exception of greece abbott historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries abbott continues to monitor the credit worthiness of customers located in 

these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbott may not be able to collect the entire balance 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures of 15 billion in 2011 10 billion in 2010 and 11 billion in 2009 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing research and development investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments and for laboratory instruments placed with customers 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 dollars in millions 



a purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements b unrecognized tax benefits totaling 19 billion are excluded from the table above as abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items 

contingent obligations 

abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business such as assignment of product rights with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these obligations based upon past experience the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote in addition abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events 

recently issued accounting standards 

in 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to topic 270 in the fasbs accounting standards codification the amendment requires that all nonowner changes in 

stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements abbott adopted this amendment for the year ended december 31 2011 and retrospectively presented all nonowner changes in stockholders equity in two separate but consecutive statements adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on abbotts results of operations cash flows or financial position 

legislative issues 

in the first quarter 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively referred to herein as health care reform legislation were signed into law in the us health care reform legislation included an increase in the basic medicaid rebate rate from 151 percent to 231 percent and extended the rebate to drugs provided through medicaid managed care organizations these medicaid rebate changes will continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margin of the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment in future years 

beginning in 2013 health care reform legislation will eliminate the federal income tax deduction for prescription drug expenses of retirees for which abbott receives reimbursement under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program as a result abbott recorded a charge of approximately 60 million in the first quarter 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities 

in 2011 abbott began recording the annual fee imposed by health care reform legislation on companies that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs the amount of the annual fee will be based on the ratio of certain of abbotts sales as compared to the total such sales of all covered entities multiplied by a fixed dollar amount specified in the legislation by year in 2011 additional rebates were incurred related to the medicare part d coverage gap donut hole beginning in 2013 abbott will record the 23 percent excise tax imposed by health care reform legislation on the sale of certain medical devices in the us 

abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors to the annual report on form 10k 

private securities litigation reform act of 1995 — a caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 abbott cautions investors that any forwardlooking statements or projections made by abbott including those made in this document are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect abbotts operations are discussed in item 1a risk factors to the annual report on form 10k

information with respect to abbotts business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to abbotts operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and abroad there have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages 

patents trademarks and licenses 

abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for abbotts products in the united states and all countries of major marketing interest to abbott abbott owns and is licensed under a substantial number of patents and patent applications principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the narrative description of business on pages 1 through 5 these and various patents which expire during the period 2011 to 2030 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbotts business abbott believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira® are material in relation to abbotts business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patents covering adalimumab will expire in december 2016 in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant for abbotts pharmaceutical products segment those related to lopinavirritonavir which is sold under the trademarks kaletra® and aluvia™ those related to fenofibrate which is sold under the trademarks tricor® and trilipix® and those related to niacin which is sold under the trademarks niaspan® and simcor® the united states composition of matter patent covering lopinavir will expire in 2016 the united states noncomposition of matter patent covering lopinavirritonavir will expire in 2016 the principal united states noncomposition of matter patents covering the fenofibrate products will expire in 2011 2018 2020 2023 and 2025 the principal united states noncomposition of matter patents covering the niacin products will expire in 2013 2017 and 2018 litigation related to the products listed above is discussed in legal proceedings on pages 16 through 20 agreements that may affect exclusivity are discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations on pages 34 through 35 

although the expiration of a composition of matter patent may lead to increased competition in most cases abbott owns or has a license to other patents that expire after the composition of matter patent related to particular formulations uses or processes for manufacturing the pharmaceutical these noncomposition of matter patents and abbotts other intellectual property along with such other factors as a competitors need to obtain regulatory approvals prior to marketing a competitive product and the nature of the market may allow abbott to continue to have commercial advantages after the expiration of the composition of matter patent including in some instances exclusivity 

seasonal aspects customers backlog and renegotiation 

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbotts business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott orders for abbotts products are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbotts business no material portion of abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

research and development 

abbott spent 3724424000 in 2010 2743733000 in 2009 and 2688811000 in 2008 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes the majority of research and development expenditures is concentrated on pharmaceutical products 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2010 were approximately 9 million and 65 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2011 are estimated to be 15 million and 67 million respectively 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency epa or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 90000 persons as of december 31 2010 

regulation 

the development manufacture sale and distribution of abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various federal state and local agencies both domestic and international which includes detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing marketing and promotion sampling distribution record keeping storage and disposal practices and achieving compliance with these regulations substantially increases the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products government regulatory actions can result in delay in the release of products seizure or recall of products suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties governmental administrative agencies also can invalidate intellectual property rights and control the entrance of multisource drugs for small molecule and biologic generic medicines in addition governmental regulatory agencies require prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers to pay fees such as application product user and establishment fees or taxes 

abbott is a party to a consent decree entered in 1999 that requires abbott to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing processes in lake county illinois conform to the us food and drug administrations 

fda quality system regulation and restricts the sale in the united states of certain products in the diagnostic products segment in 2003 the fda concluded that those operations were in substantial conformity with the quality system regulation 

international operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations many countries directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations control the selling price of most health care products furthermore many countries limit the importation of raw materials and finished products 

continuing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components are being conducted by industry government agencies and others such studies which employ increasingly sophisticated methods and techniques can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of marketing of such products and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to and the cost of human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries in the united states most states have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for medicine delivered under part d and beginning in 2011 companies must provide a discount of 50 percent for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap medicare is implementing a competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment enteral nutrition products and supplies under federal law manufacturers must pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans in addition a majority of states are seeking additional rebates the veterans health care act of 1992 requires manufacturers to extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the department of veterans affairs department of defense public health service entities and institutions as well as certain other covered entities 

in the united states governmental cost containment efforts have extended to the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic all states are mandated to have in place a cost containment program for infant formula as a result states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program through competitive bidding 

abbott expects debate to continue during 2011 at all government levels over marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbott believes that legislation could change access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services make changes to health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure 

efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector health care providers have responded by instituting various cost reduction and containment measures 

it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

international operations 

abbott markets products worldwide through affiliates and distributors most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the united states in addition certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the united states international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbotts securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbotts actual results abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbotts credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbotts future revenues and operating income 

many of abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbotts intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbotts business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbotts intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced abbotts principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in the sections captioned patents trademarks and licenses and financial review and litigation regarding these patents is described in the section captioned legal proceedings 

abbott faces increasing competition from lowercost generic products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes that may significantly reduce abbotts sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbotts competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on its revenues margins business and results of operations 

competitors intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbotts future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into license agreements abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of 

affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbotts profitability and financial condition 

abbott is subject to costcontainment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned regulation to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to healthcare or other factors abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns many of abbotts facilities and procedures and those of abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbotts products and criminal prosecution these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbotts business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbotts facilities while abbott or abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbotts industry is also subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition 

changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect abbotts business 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law on march 23 2010 and march 30 2010 respectively a number of the provisions of those laws require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement the laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries future rulemaking could increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or require additional reporting and disclosure abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking 

abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause abbotts revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies to accomplish this abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development a high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbotts products to become obsolete causing abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer 

new products and technological advances by abbotts competitors may negatively affect abbotts results of operations 

abbotts products face intense competition from its competitors products competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbotts products abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbotts business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors in addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product 

is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and profitability 

significant safety issues could arise for abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on abbotts revenues and financial condition 

all health care products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety issues are reported abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety issues with an abbott product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authorities safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbotts products

abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs abbotts primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals nutritional products diagnostic testing products and vascular products sales in international markets are approximately 55 percent of consolidated net sales 

continued robust growth of humira after the worldwide launch of additional indications the acquisitions of solvays pharmaceuticals business solvay pharmaceuticals piramal healthcare limiteds healthcare solutions business and advanced medical optics inc the launch of the xience v drug eluting stent the conclusion of the tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products and the challenging economic environment in many countries around the world have impacted abbotts sales costs and financial position over the last three years 

pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology oncology neuroscience pain management hepatitis c hcv chronic kidney disease and womens health in 2003 abbott began the worldwide launch of humira for rheumatoid arthritis followed by launches for five additional indications which increased humiras worldwide sales to 65 billion in 2010 compared to 55 billion in 2009 and 45 billion in 2008 abbott forecasts growth in the low teens for worldwide humira sales in 2011 abbott is studying additional indications for humira  substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of humira  increased generic competition has resulted in us depakote sales declining from 13 billion in 2008 to 161 million in 2010 austerity measures implemented by several european countries reduced healthcare spending and affected pharmaceutical pricing in the second half of 2010 and that impact is expected to continue for all of 2011 

in february 2010 abbott acquired solvay pharmaceuticals which provided abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expanded abbotts presence in key global emerging markets the acquisition added approximately 31 billion to abbotts 2010 total sales primarily outside the us in 2010 abbott recorded approximately 710 million of expense related to the integration of the solvay business and a restructuring plan announced in september to streamline operations improve efficiencies and reduce costs primarily in certain solvay sites and functions the restructuring plan is further described below in september 2010 abbott completed the acquisition of piramals healthcare solutions business propelling abbott to market leadership in the indian pharmaceutical market and further accelerating the companys growth in emerging markets 

in 2007 abbotts nutritional products businesses were reorganized into a worldwide business to better leverage the opportunities available for strong nutritional brands significant efforts have been focused on capturing those opportunities particularly in developing markets where growth has been strong 

in 2008 abbott received fda approval to market the xience v drug eluting stent in the us and in 2006 received european union approval xience v became the marketleading drug eluting stent in the us in the fourth quarter of 2008 in june 2009 xience prime  abbotts next generation drug eluting stent received ce mark approval and was launched in europe in august 2009 abbott received approval to market xience v in japan in january 2010 and xience v became the marketleading drug eluting stent in japan in the second quarter of 2010 

in 2010 the us government passed health care reform legislation which included an increase in medicaid rebate rates and the extension of the rebate to drugs provided through medicaid managed care 

organizations beginning in 2010 the legislation also imposes annual fees to be paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device companies beginning in 2011 and 2013 respectively as well as additional rebates related to the medicare part d donut hole beginning in 2011 in addition to a onetime charge of approximately 60 million to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy the legislation negatively impacted abbotts performance by more than 200 million in 2010 and that is expected to increase to more than 400 million in 2011 

abbotts short and longterm debt totaled 189 billion at december 31 2010 largely incurred to finance acquisitions operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years at december 31 2010 abbotts longterm debt rating was aa by standard and poors corporation and a1 by moodys investors service 

in april 2008 abbott and takeda concluded their tap pharmaceutical products inc tap joint venture evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture in a taxfree exchange abbott received taps lupron business in exchange for abbotts 50 percent ownership in tap luprons us results are included in the pharmaceutical products segment beginning in may 2008 abbott also receives payments based on specified development approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by takeda and payments from takeda based on sales of products retained by takeda 

in 2011 abbott will focus on several key initiatives in the pharmaceutical business abbott will continue to build its global presence expand its presence in emerging markets and diversify its sources of growth with the solvay pharmaceuticals and piramal healthcare solutions acquisitions abbott will also continue maximizing the market potential for humira  pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus a significant portion of expenditures on compounds for immunology oncology neuroscience pain management hcv chronic kidney disease and womens health such compounds include one phase iii compound for multiple sclerosis one phase iii compound and three phase ii compounds in oncology three phase ii compounds targeting hcv three phase ii compounds targeting alzheimers disease or cognitive disorders of schizophrenia two phase ii compounds targeting chronic kidney disease and one phase ii compound each in womens health and pain management in the vascular business abbott will continue to focus on marketing xience prime in europe and other markets obtaining regulatory review of xience nano  xience prime  and the mitraclip device in the us and a limited european rollout as well as further clinical development of absorb  its bioresorbable vascular scaffold bvs device in the other business segments abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets 

critical accounting policies 

sales rebates — approximately 50 percent of abbotts consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances are in the pharmaceutical products segment and the nutritional products segment abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies state agencies that administer the federal medicaid program insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to 24 months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks 

charged against gross sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 amounted to approximately 49 billion 44 billion and 38 billion respectively or 231 percent 238 percent and 228 percent respectively based on gross sales of approximately 211 billion 184 billion and 168 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately 211 million in 2010 abbott considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 415 million 414 million and 362 million for cash discounts in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and 537 million 456 million and 439 million for returns in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbotts historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management has access to several large customers inventory management data and for other customers utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data in addition internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the states and internally administered market research the usda has been making its data available for many years internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data at december 31 2010 abbott had the exclusive wic business in 23 states 

in the domestic pharmaceutical business the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data to estimate the price rebate percentage systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant and abbott believes they are reliable 

the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals which comprise approximately 69 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2010 remaining rebate 

provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings  dollars in millions  



historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for medicaid medicare and other government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items are often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment in the us abbotts federal income tax returns through 2005 are settled and the income tax returns for years after 2005 are open abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 

pension and postemployment benefits — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates discount rates and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits the health care cost trend rates represent abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for decades can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs negative asset returns in 2008 due to poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2010 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of 29 billion and 307 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan 

assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period note 4 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 

valuation of intangible assets — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk the cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles abbott reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs at december 31 2010 goodwill and intangibles amounted to 159 billion and 122 billion respectively and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to 14 billion in 2010 there were no impairments of goodwill in 2010 2009 or 2008 

litigation — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 450 contingencies under asc no 450 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 75 million to 115 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures reserves of approximately 95 million have been recorded at december 31 2010 for these proceedings and exposures these reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss as defined by fasb asc no 450 contingencies 

stock compensation — abbott records the fair value of stock options in its results of operations since there is no market for trading employee stock options management must use a fair value method there is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash fair value methods require management to make several assumptions the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model stock price volatility and the average life of an option abbott has readily available grantbygrant historical activity for several years in its option administration system that it uses in developing some of its assumptions abbott uses the blackscholes model to value stock options abbott uses both historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of traded options to develop the volatility assumptions abbott uses the historical grant activity combined with expectations about future exercise activity to develop the average life assumptions abbott has also used the historical grant data to evaluate whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and has not found any differentiating pattern among holders 

results of operations 

sales 

the following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last three years 



worldwide sales growth in 2010 reflects the acquisition of solvays pharmaceuticals business on february 15 2010 unit growth and the positive effect of the relatively weaker us dollar worldwide sales growth in 2009 reflects unit growth and the acquisition of advanced medical optics inc on february 25 2009 partially offset by the negative effect of the relatively stronger us dollar worldwide us and pharmaceutical products segment sales also reflect decreased sales of depakote due to generic competition in 2009 excluding us depakote sales worldwide sales increased 77 percent us sales increased 76 percent and pharmaceutical products segment sales increased 43 percent from 2008 to 2009 

worldwide 2008 sales growth reflects unit growth and the positive effect of the relatively weaker us dollar 

a comparison of significant product group sales is as follows percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 



decreased sales of depakote due to generic competition impacted us specialty product sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 and lower sales of zemplar  kaletra and lupron affected us specialty product sales in 2010 these were partially offset by increased sales of humira in all three years and the addition of lupron sales from the conclusion of the tap joint venture in april 2008 which increased us specialty product sales in 2009 and 2008 us sales of humira were 28 billion 25 billion and 22 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and us sales of depakote were 161 million 331 million and 13 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively us primary care sales were impacted by the discontinuation of azmacort and generic competition for cardizem la in 2010 by decreased sales of synthroid in 2009 and 2008 and by decreased sales of omnicef and biaxin in 2008 due to generic competition these were partially offset in all three years by increased sales of niaspan and in 2010 and 2008 by higher tricortrilipix franchise sales increased sales volume of humira in 2010 2009 and 2008 favorably impacted international pharmaceuticals sales partially offset by decreased sales of clarithromycin international sales of humira were 37 billion 30 billion and 23 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the relatively weaker dollar increased international pharmaceutical sales in 2010 and 2008 by 19 percent and 73 percent respectively the relatively stronger us dollar decreased international pharmaceutical sales in 2009 by 86 percent international pediatric nutritionals sales increases were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries us pediatric nutritionals sales in 2010 were affected by the voluntary recall of certain similacbrand powder infant formulas in september 2010 international adult nutritionals sales and immunochemistry sales in 2010 and 2008 were positively impacted by the effect of the relatively weaker us dollar and were negatively impacted in 2009 by the effect of the relatively stronger us dollar abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were approximately 58 million 120 million and 111 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the expiration of licenses patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott there are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years under a license agreement for tricor 145 mg generic competition could begin as early as march 2011 but is not expected until july 2012 under an agreement relating to abbotts niacin products 

and acquired with the kos pharmaceuticals acquisition niaspan may become subject to generic competition in september 2013 

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 583 percent of net sales in 2010 571 percent in 2009 and 573 percent in 2008 the increase in the gross profit margin in 2010 was due in part to improved margins in the pharmaceutical vascular diabetes and diagnostics businesses and the favorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio the decrease in the gross profit margin in 2009 was due in part to the negative impact from lower sales of depakote and the unfavorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio partially offset by improved margins in the vascular and diagnostics businesses the increase in the gross profit margin in 2008 was due in part to favorable product mix and the favorable impact of foreign exchange 

in the us states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional and pharmaceutical products segments 

research and development expense was 3724 billion in 2010 2744 billion in 2009 and 2689 billion in 2008 and represented increases of 357 percent in 2010 20 percent in 2009 and 73 percent in 2008 excluding charges related to the solvay restructurings announced in september 2010 research and development expenses in 2010 increased 294 percent this increase exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges reflects the acquisitions of solvays pharmaceuticals business in february 2010 and facet biotech in april 2010 the increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009 excluding the effect of exchange research and development expenses increased 34 percent in 2009 the increases in 2010 2009 and 2008 also reflect continued pipeline spending including programs in vascular devices biologics neuroscience oncology and hepatitis c the majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 234 percent in 2010 decreased 04 percent in 2009 and increased 139 percent in 2008 excluding charges related to the solvay restructuring and integration charges selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 182 percent this increase exclusive of the effects of the restructuring and integration charges reflects the acquisitions of solvays pharmaceuticals business in 2010 and advanced medical optics inc in 2009 and higher provisions for litigation in 2010 the 2009 decrease reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which was offset by expenses relating to the acquisition of advanced medical optics inc and the settlement of litigation excluding the effects of the charges and exchange selling general and administrative expenses increased 09 percent in 2009 the 2008 increase reflects the settlement of litigation relating to tricor  which increased selling general and administration expenses by 31 percentage points the remaining increases in selling general and administrative expenses were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products including continued spending for humira and xience v  and inflation 

conclusion of tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture and sale of abbotts spine business 

on april 30 2008 abbott and takeda concluded their tap pharmaceutical products inc tap joint venture evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture abbott exchanged its 50 percent equity interest in tap for the assets liabilities and employees related to taps lupron business subsequent to the conclusion of the joint venture tap was merged into two takeda entities the exchange of abbotts investment in tap for taps lupron business resulted in a gain at closing of approximately 94 million the internal revenue service has issued a private letter ruling that the transaction qualifies as taxfree for us income tax purposes 

beginning on may 1 2008 abbott began recording us lupron net sales and costs in its operating results and no longer records income from the tap joint venture taps sales of lupron were 182 million for the four months ended april 30 2008 abbott also receives payments based on specified development approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by takeda and payments from takeda based on sales of products retained by takeda which are recorded by abbott as other income expense net when the specified event is achieved or as the applicable sales are made 

the exchange transaction was accounted for as a sale of abbotts equity interest in tap and as an acquisition of taps lupron business the sale of abbotts equity interest in tap resulted in the recording of net assets related to the lupron business primarily cash receivables inventory and other assets net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities offset by a credit to abbotts investment in tap in the amount of approximately 280 million 

for the acquired lupron business abbott recorded intangible assets primarily lupron product rights of approximately 700 million goodwill of approximately 350 million and deferred tax liabilities related primarily to the intangible assets of approximately 260 million the intangible assets are being amortized over 15 years abbott agreed to remit cash to takeda if certain research and development events were not achieved on the development assets retained by takeda these amounts were recorded as a liability at closing in the amount of approximately 11 billion related deferred tax assets of approximately 410 million were also recorded of the 11 billion abbott made taxdeductible payments of 36 million 83 million and 200 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 in 2009 events occurred resulting in the remaining payments not being required and the remaining liability in the amount of 797 million was derecognized and recorded as income in other income expense net 

in 2008 abbott sold its spine business for approximately 360 million in cash resulting in an aftertax gain of approximately 147 million which is presented as gain on sale of discontinued operations net of taxes in the accompanying statement of income the operations and financial position of the spine business are not presented as discontinued operations because the effects would not be significant 

restructurings 

in 2010 abbott management approved a restructuring plan primarily related to the acquisition of solvays pharmaceuticals business this plan streamlines operations improves efficiencies and reduces costs in certain solvay sites and functions as well as in certain abbott and solvay commercial organizations in various countries action plans have been identified and most are expected to be implemented within the next two years this plan will result in pretax charges of approximately 810 million to 970 million over the life of the plan these charges include employeerelated costs of approximately 650 million accelerated depreciation and asset writedowns of approximately 105 million and other related exit costs of up to approximately 215 million mainly related to discontinuation of certain research and development programs and product transfers under this plan abbott recorded charges to cost of products sold research and development and selling general and administrative of approximately 99 million 152 million and 272 million respectively additional charges of 12 million were subsequently recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation the following summarizes the activity for this restructuring dollars in millions 



in 2010 and prior years abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs in 2010 2009 and 2008 abbott recorded charges of approximately 56 million 114 million and 36 million respectively reflecting the impairment of 

manufacturing facilities and other assets employee severance and other related charges approximately 56 million in 2010 is classified as cost of products sold and 114 million and 36 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively are classified as selling general and administrative an additional 13 million 47 million and 81 million were subsequently recorded in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively relating to these restructurings primarily for accelerated depreciation the following summarizes the activity for these restructurings dollars in millions 



in 2008 abbott management approved a plan to streamline global manufacturing operations reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in abbotts core diagnostic business in 2008 abbott recorded a charge to cost of products sold of approximately 129 million under the plan additional charges of approximately 60 million 54 million and 16 million were recorded in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively relating to this restructuring primarily for accelerated depreciation and product transfer costs additional charges will be incurred through 2011 as a result of product reregistration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries and product transition timelines the following summarizes the activity for this restructuring dollars in millions 



interest expense and interest income 

in 2010 interest expense increased due primarily to increased debt levels in 2009 and 2008 interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower interest rates partially offset by increased debt levels in 2009 related to the acquisition of advanced medical optics inc interest income decreased in 2010 due to lower investment balances decreased in 2009 due to lower interest rates and increased in 2008 due to higher interest rates 

other income expense net 

other income expense net for 2009 includes the derecognition of a contingent liability of 797 million associated with the conclusion of the tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture as discussed above a 287 million gain from the settlement reached between abbott and medtronic inc resolving all outstanding intellectual property litigation between the two parties and income from the recording of certain investments at fair value in connection with business acquisitions other income 

expense net for 2010 2009 and 2008 also includes ongoing contractual payments from takeda associated with the conclusion of the tap joint venture and a gain in 2008 on the sale of an equity investment accounted for as an availableforsale investment in addition abbott recorded a gain of approximately 94 million in connection with the dissolution of the tap joint venture in 2008 

taxes on earnings 

the income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 190 percent in 2010 201 percent in 2009 and 192 percent in 2008 as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act which were signed into law in 2010 abbott recorded a charge of approximately 60 million in 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy the tax rate in 2009 was affected by a higher tax rate applied to the derecognition of a contingent liability associated with the conclusion of the tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture and the medtronic intellectual property litigation settlement 

in october 2010 puerto rico enacted legislation that assesses a tax beginning in 2011 on certain products manufactured in puerto rico this excise tax will be recorded in cost of products sold although the tax is expected to be creditable for us income tax purposes 

research and development programs 

abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical medical and nutritional products in development the significant areas of therapeutic focus include the following 

pharmaceutical products — 

immunology — projects are ongoing to identify new mechanisms with the potential to treat an array of immunemediated diseases projects include early stage work in oral dmard therapies and a number of biologic candidates 

phase iii trials are ongoing for additional indications of humira including ulcerative colitis in japan ankylosing spondylitits in china pediatric crohns disease in the us and the european union eu uvetis in the us eu and japan and peripheral and axial spondyloarthritis in the us and eu global regulatory applications for ulcerative colitis were submitted in early 2011

given the diversity of abbotts business its intention to remain a broadbased healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project compound or device over the next year relative to abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbotts overall market position there were no delays in abbotts 2010 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical and medical device projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbotts ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development however abbott plans to continue to manage our portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 95 percent to 10 percent of sales each year

expires in october 2012 and a 37 billion facility expires in 2013 related compensating balances which are subject to withdrawal by abbott at its option and commitment fees are not material

working capital 

working capital was 51 billion at december 31 2010 103 billion at december 31 2009 and 55 billion at december 31 2008 the decrease in working capital in 2010 was due primarily to cash and investments used to acquire solvays pharmaceuticals business and piramal healthcare limiteds healthcare solutions business the increase in working capital in 2009 was due primarily to increased levels of cash and investments and the derecognition of a contingent liability associated with the conclusion of the tap joint venture partially offset by increased debt levels 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures of 10 billion in 2010 11 billion in 2009 and 13 billion in 2008 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing research and development investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments and for laboratory instruments placed with customers

contingent obligations 

abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business such as assignment of product rights with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these obligations based upon past experience the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote in addition abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events 

legislative issues 

in the first quarter 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively referred to herein as health care reform legislation were signed into law in the us health care reform legislation included an increase in the basic medicaid rebate rate from 151 percent to 231 percent and extended the rebate to drugs provided through medicaid managed care organizations these medicaid rebate changes will continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margin of the pharmaceutical products segment in future quarters 

beginning in 2013 health care reform legislation will eliminate the federal income tax deduction for prescription drug expenses of retirees for which abbott receives reimbursement under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program as a result abbott recorded a charge of approximately 60 million in the first quarter 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities 

in 2011 abbott will begin recording the annual fee imposed by health care reform legislation on companies that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs the amount of the annual fee will be based on the ratio of certain of abbotts sales as compared to the total such sales of all 

covered entities multiplied by a fixed dollar amount specified in the legislation by year in 2011 additional rebates will be incurred related to the medicare part d coverage gap donut hole beginning in 2013 abbott will record the 23 percent excise tax imposed by health care reform legislation on the sale of certain medical devices in the us 

abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors to the annual report on form 10k

in addition certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are markedtomarket with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the 

products are sold generally within the next twelve months at december 31 2010 and 2009 abbott held 13 billion and 20 billion respectively of such contracts which all mature in the following calendar year 

abbott has designated foreign denominated shortterm debt of approximately 650 million and approximately 575 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary accordingly changes in the fair value of this debt due to changes in exchange rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax

information with respect to abbott’s business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to abbott’s operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and abroad there have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages 

patents trademarks and licenses 

abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for abbott’s products in the united states and all countries of major marketing interest to abbott abbott owns and is licensed under a substantial number of patents and patent applications principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the narrative description of business on pages 1 through 5 these and various patents which expire during the period 2007 to 2026 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbott’s business abbott believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira® are material in relation to abbott’s business as a whole the united states composition of matter patents covering adalimumab will expire in 2016 in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant for abbott’s pharmaceutical products segment those related to clarithromycin which is sold under the trademarks biaxin® klacid® and klaricid® those related to divalproex sodium which is sold under the trademark depakote® those related to lansoprazole which is sold under the trademarks prevacid® and ogastro® those related to cefdinir which is sold under the trademark omnicef® those related to lopinavirritonavir which is sold under the trademark kaletra® those related to fenofibrate which is sold under the trademark tricor® and those related to sevoflurane which is sold under the trademarks sevorane® and ultane® the united states composition of matter patent covering clarithromycin is licensed from taisho pharmaceutical co ltd of tokyo japan and expired in 2005 the united states composition of matter patents covering divalproex sodium will expire in 2008 the united states composition of matter patent covering lansoprazole is licensed by tap from takeda and will expire in 2009 the united states composition of matter patent covering lopinavir will expire in 2015 the united states composition of matter patents covering ritonavir will expire in 2015 the united states composition of matter patent covering lopinavirritonavir will expire in 2016 the united states composition of matter patent covering cefdinir is licensed from astellas corporation and expires in 2007 the united states crystal form of cefdinir is licensed from astellas corporation and expires is 2011 the principal united states noncomposition of matter patents covering the fenofibrate products will expire in 2009 2011 2018 and 2020 the principal noncomposition of matter patents covering sevoflurane in the pharmaceutical products segment’s major markets will expire in 2018 litigation involving abbott’s patents covering adalimumab cefdinir clarithromycin divalproex sodium and sevoflurane as well as litigation involving patents used in the operation of abbott’s vascular products segment is discussed in legal proceedings on pages 16 and 17

although the expiration of a composition of matter patent may lead to increased competition in most cases abbott owns or has a license to other patents that expire after the composition of matter patent related to particular formulations uses or processes for manufacturing the pharmaceutical these noncomposition of matter patents and abbott’s other intellectual property along with such other factors as a competitor’s need to obtain regulatory approvals prior to marketing a competitive product and the nature of the market may allow abbott to continue to maintain exclusivity or have other commercial advantages after the expiration of the composition of matter patent 

seasonal aspects customers backlog and renegotiation 

there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbott’s business the incidence of certain infectious diseases which occur at various times in different areas of the world does however affect the demand for abbott’s antiinfective products orders for abbott’s products are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbott’s business abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on abbott no material portion of abbott’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

research and development 

abbott spent 2255271000 in 2006 1821175000 in 2005 and 1696753000 in 2004 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes the majority of research and development expenditures is concentrated on pharmaceutical products 

environmental matters 

abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbott’s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2006 were approximately 8 million and 58 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2007 are estimated to be 6 million and 62 million respectively 

abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency epa or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on abbott’s financial position cash flows or operations 

employees 

abbott employed approximately 66663 persons as of december 31 2006 

regulation 

the development manufacture sale and distribution of abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various federal state and local agencies which includes detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing marketing and promotion sampling distribution record keeping storage and disposal practices and achieving compliance with these regulations substantially increases the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products government regulatory actions can result in delay in the release of products seizure or recall of products suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions in addition governmental regulatory agencies require prescription drug and medical device manufacturers to pay fees such as application product and establishment fees 

abbott is a party to a consent decree entered in 1999 that requires abbott to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing processes in lake county illinois conform with the fda’s quality system regulation and restricts the sale in the united states of certain products in the diagnostics product segment in 2003 the fda concluded that those operations were in substantial conformity with that regulation abbott is introducing new diagnostics products manufactured at its lake county illinois facilities and continuing the process of reintroducing products removed from the market as a result of the consent decree 

international operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations many countries directly or indirectly through reimbursement limitations control the selling price of most health care products furthermore many countries limit the importation of raw materials and finished products 

continuing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components are being conducted by industry government agencies and others such studies which employ increasingly sophisticated methods and techniques can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of marketing of such products and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to and the cost of human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries in the united states most states have enacted generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer’s version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in 2006 a prescription drug benefit was implemented under the medicare program providing eligible individuals with greater access to prescription drugs increases in sales volume may be offset by federal government efforts to manage the costs of the medicare program in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on diagnosis rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products under federal law manufacturers must pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans in addition a majority of states are seeking additional rebates the veterans health care act of 1992 requires manufacturers to extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the department of veterans affairs department of defense public health service entities and institutions as well as certain other covered entities 

in the united states governmental cost containment efforts have extended to the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic all states are mandated to have in place a cost containment program for infant formula as a result states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program through competitive bidding 

abbott expects debate to continue during 2007 at both the federal and the state level over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbott believes that if legislation is enacted it could have the effect of reducing prices or reducing the rate of price increases for health care products and services 

efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector health care providers have responded by instituting various cost reduction and containment measures 

it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

international operations 

abbott markets products in approximately 130 countries through affiliates and distributors most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the united states in addition certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the united states international operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action

 item 1a   risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of abbott’s securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbott or risks abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect abbott’s actual results abbott’s business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbott may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbott’s credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

abbott holds a significant investment in boston scientific and is subject to market and credit risk 

on april 21 2006 in connection with abbott’s acquisition of the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses of guidant corporation abbott purchased 646 million shares of boston scientific stock for 14 billion and loaned bsc international holding limited a whollyowned subsidiary of boston scientific 900 million on a subordinated basis as long as abbott holds the shares abbott will have a substantial undiversified equity investment in boston scientific and therefore will be subject to the risk of changes in the market value of those shares until october 2007 abbott generally may not in any one month period sell more than approximately 54 million shares additionally abbott is required to dispose of these shares no later than october 31 2008 as long as the loan is outstanding abbott will be a general unsecured creditor of boston scientific with respect to the 900 million loan and as such is subject to credit risk 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect abbott’s future revenues and operating income 

many of abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection although most of the challenges to abbott’s intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property protections to the extent abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow abbott to compete effectively abbott’s business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbott’s intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced abbott’s principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in the sections captioned “patents trademarks and licenses” and “financial review” and litigation regarding these patents is described in the section captioned “legal proceedings” 

competitors’ intellectual property may prevent abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbott’s future profitability and financial condition 

competitors may claim that an abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbott to enter into royalty or license agreements if this should be necessary abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected abbott products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s profitability and financial condition 

abbott is subject to costcontainment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

in the united states and other countries abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing costcontainment efforts by the government and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “regulation” to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to healthcare or other factors abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced

abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration and numerous other national supranational federal and state authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that abbott will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns many of abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations possible regulatory actions could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of abbott’s products and criminal prosecution these actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to abbott’s business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbott’s products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbott’s facilities while abbott or abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues profitability and financial condition 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbott require abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

abbott’s industry is also subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations 

of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues profitability and financial condition 

if abbott does not introduce new products in a timely manner abbott’s products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy abbott’s products and abbott’s revenue and profitability may decline 

demand for abbott’s products may change in ways abbott does not anticipate this could occur for example due to changing customer needs the introduction by others of new products and technologies or changing industry standards without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements abbott’s products may become obsolete over time causing abbott’s revenue and operating results to suffer even if abbott succeeds in creating new product candidates these candidates may not become commercially successful products if abbott does not achieve positive clinical outcomes meet regulatory requirements or establish and maintain its intellectual property rights 

even if abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of abbott’s existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by abbott’s competitors of products embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement 

the manufacture of many of abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products abbott’s business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and profitability 

the international nature of abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally sales outside of the united states make up more than 45 of abbott’s net sales the risks associated with abbott’s operations outside the united states include 

·   changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs

·   multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict abbott’s ability to manufacture and sell its products

·   differing local product preferences and product requirements

·   trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements

·   difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations

·   differing labor regulations

·   potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws

·   political and economic instability

·   inflation recession and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates and

·   diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries

these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbott’s revenues and profitability

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial review 

abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under shortterm receivable arrangements patent protection and licenses technological and performance features and inclusion of abbott’s products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold price controls competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales abbott’s primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals nutritional products vascular products and diagnostic testing products abbott also owns 50 percent of tap pharmaceutical products inc that abbott accounts for on the equity method 

the worldwide launch of humira  the acquisition of guidant’s vascular business the amendment of the boehringer ingelheim agreement and the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products have impacted abbott’s sales costs and financial position over the last three years 

pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology oncology neuroscience metabolism and viral diseases in 2003 abbott began the worldwide launch of humira  which increased its worldwide sales to 20 billion in 2006 compared to 14 billion in 2005 substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of humira  in december 2006 abbott acquired kos pharmaceuticals which complements abbott’s existing franchise in the dyslipidemia market and strengthens the latestage and midterm pharmaceutical pipeline with opportunities in cholesterol management asthma and inhaled insulin in 2005 abbott and boehringer ingelheim bi amended their agreement whereby abbott distributed and promoted bi products effective january 1 2006 abbott no longer distributed or recorded sales for distribution activities for the bi products abbott’s gross margins for bi products from the prior agreement in effect through december 31 2005 were substantially lower than its average gross margins sales of bi products were 150 million and 23 billion in 2006 and 2005 respectively in addition increased generic competition resulted in worldwide sales of clarithromycin declining 23 percent in 2006 

in 2005 and 2006 abbott’s nutritional products businesses were reorganized into a worldwide business to better leverage the opportunities available for strong nutritional brands significant efforts have been focused on capturing those opportunities particularly in developing markets 

in april 2006 abbott acquired guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and began to integrate it with abbott’s vascular business the acquisition significantly improved abbott’s competitive position in this business that is characterized by rapid innovation in 2006 abbott received european union approval to market the xience v drug eluting stent 

abbott’s diagnostic segment is comprised of four separate divisions — immunoassayhematology diabetes care molecular and point of care in early 2004 abbott acquired therasense for 12 billion and began to integrate it with abbott’s diabetes care business in january 2007 abbott announced that it had agreed to sell its core laboratory diagnostics business including abbott point of care to ge for 813 billion in cash abbott expects the sale to close in the first half of 2007 abbott’s molecular diagnostics and diabetes care businesses are not part of this transaction and will remain part of abbott 

abbott’s short and longterm debt totaled 124 billion at december 31 2006 largely incurred to finance recent acquisitions operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have allowed abbott to fund acquisitions over the last three years at december 31 2006 abbott’s longterm debt rating was aa by standard and poor’s corporation and a1 by moody’s investors service 

in 2007 abbott will focus on several key initiatives in the pharmaceutical business abbott will continue the launch of newly approved indications for humira  and will also focus on the integration of kos pharmaceuticals into the pharmaceutical products segment pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus on the therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new humira indications abbott expects to submit additional pharmaceutical regulatory filings in 2007 in the vascular business abbott will continue the launch of the xience v drugeluting stent in europe and will launch in the us upon approval by the fda for diabetes care abbott anticipates the approval of freestyle navigator  effort will also be required for the sale and separation of abbott’s core laboratory and point of care diagnostics businesses in the other business segments abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets

sales rebates  — approximately 40 percent of abbott’s consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale most of these rebates and allowances are in the pharmaceutical products segment and the nutritional products segment abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies to state agencies that administer the federal medicaid and medicare programs and the special supplemental food program for women infants and children wic wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate using historical trends adjusted for current changes abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to 24 months after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 amounted to approximately 26 billion 25 billion and 24 billion respectively or 232 percent 229 percent and 256 percent respectively based on gross sales of approximately 110 billion 109 billion and 93 billion respectively subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales and operating earnings by approximately 110 million in 2006 other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately 247 million 284 million and 233 million for cash discounts in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively and 209 million 162 million and 163 million for returns in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated returns can be reliably estimated because abbott’s historical returns are low and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management internally estimates the inventory in the retail channel that is not on the retail shelf a third party continuously measures time on the retail shelf which is a relatively significant portion of the time inventory is in the distribution channel except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially management also estimates the states’ processing lag time based on claims data in addition internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably estimable estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the 

us department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the states and internally administered market surveys the usda has been making its data available for many years internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data at december 31 2006 abbott had the exclusive wic business in 11 states 

in the domestic pharmaceutical business the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances management uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data to estimate the price rebate percentage systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price abbott’s systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant and abbott believes they are reliable 

the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals  which comprise approximately 76 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2006 remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings  dollars in thousands  

 

  

adjustments for prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for medicaid medicare and other government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

income taxes  — abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit items are often very complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible as part of abbott’s calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits each quarter abbott reviews its exposures in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” in the us abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2003 are settled and the income tax returns for years after 2003 are open except for taxes on dividends that were remitted under the 

american jobs creation act of 2004 abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries on january 1 2007 abbott must adopt the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” which changes the measurement of tax contingencies under this interpretation in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit this interpretation will result in significantly more effort to assess tax uncertainties than was required under sfas no 5 and may result in initial recording of tax expense that exceeds the expected resolution of tax uncertainties the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on abbott’s january 1 2007 balance sheet or the 2007 provision for income taxes 

pension and postemployment benefits  — abbott offers pension benefits and postemployment health care to many of its employees abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs abbott must develop longterm assumptions the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate discount rate and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates used to measure liabilities as of december 31 2006 and 2005 were determined based on highquality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits prior to december 31 2005 the discount rate was determined by reference to a composite corporate aa bond index the health care cost trend rate represents abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates which will not be known for decades can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs recent low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans at december 31 2006 pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbott’s defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were 14 billion and 537 million respectively actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service periods of the employees under the corridor method in accordance with the rules for accounting for postemployment benefits differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period footnote 4 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a onepercentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point on december 31 2006 abbott adopted the provisions of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” the provisions of this statement require the immediate recognition of the deferrals on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss adoption of this statement on december 31 2006 resulted in a decrease in abbott’s shareholders’ equity of approximately 13 billion

valuation of intangible assets  — abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired inprocess research and development and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows risk the cost of capital and terminal values each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott’s critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to its fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or 

when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs at december 31 2006 goodwill and intangibles amounted to 94 billion and 64 billion respectively and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to 575 million in 2006 there were no impairments of goodwill in 2006 2005 or 2004 at december 31 2006 the valuations for the guidant and kos acquisitions have not been finalized 

litigation  — abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” under sfas no 5 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected except for one group of cases relating to pharmaceutical pricing for which abbott is unable to estimate a loss if any abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately 165 million to 295 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures reserves of approximately 200 million have been recorded at december 31 2006 for these proceedings and exposures these reserves represent management’s best estimate of probable loss as defined by sfas no 5

stock compensation  — through december 31 2005 abbott measured compensation cost using the intrinsic valuebased method of accounting for stock options granted to employees and disclosed the impact of the fair value method in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements on january 1 2006 abbott adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” which requires that fair value be recorded in the results of operations since there is no market for trading employee stock options management must use a fair value method there is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash fair value methods require management to make several assumptions the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model stock price volatility and the average life of an option abbott has readily available grantbygrant historical activity for several years in its option administration system that it uses in developing some of its assumptions abbott uses the blackscholes method to value stock options the results of the blackscholes model are periodically compared to the binomial model and the results have been comparable abbott uses both historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of currently traded options to develop the volatility assumptions abbott uses the historical grant activity combined with expectations about future exercise activity to develop the average life assumptions abbott has also used the historical grant data to evaluate whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and has not found any differentiating pattern among holders abbott quantified the additional paid in capital amount available for use in determining tax effects of early exercise for measurement of tax expense abbott used the modified prospective method of adoption under this method prior years’ financial results do not include the impact of recording stock options using fair value footnote 9 quantifies the effect in 2005 and 2004 had compensation cost been determined using the fair value method

results of operations 

sales 

the following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last three years 

 

  

a   the pharmaceutical products segment had an agreement with boehringer ingelheim bi to copromote and distribute three of its products in the us in 2005 abbott and bi amended the agreement and effective january 1 2006 abbott no longer distributed or recorded sales for distribution activities for the bi products the increases in sales for 2006 excluding bi products were 116 percent for total net sales 123 percent for total us sales and 78 percent for pharmaceutical products segment sales

a comparison of significant product group sales is as follows percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 

 

  

increased sales volume of humira and increased volume and price for kaletra and depakote favorably impacted us specialty sales increased sales volume for tricor and omnicef favorably impacted us primary care sales and were partially offset by lower us sales of biaxin due primarily to generic competition for the immediaterelease formulation us sales of biaxin were 151 million 306 million and 458 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively increased sales volume of humira favorably impacted international pharmaceuticals sales partially offset by decreased sales volume in 2006 due to generic competition for clarithromycin diabetes care product sales growth in 2005 and 2004 was favorably impacted by the acquisition of therasense in the second quarter of 2004 the decrease in sales of us pediatric nutritionals in 2005 was primarily due to overall infant nutritionals nonwic category decline and competitive share loss international pediatric nutritionals sales increases were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries us adult nutritionals sales in 2005 and 2004 were favorably impacted by the acquisition of eas in the fourth quarter of 2004 abbott has periodically sold product rights to nonstrategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott’s revenue recognition policies as discussed in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements related net sales were 199 million in 2006 177 million in 2005 and 144 million in 2004 

the expiration of licenses patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott significant ongoing generic activities and significant patent and license expirations in the next three years are as follows the us composition of matter patent for depakote expires in 2008 abbott holds noncomposition of matter patents on the extended release form of depakote  us sales of depakote in 2006 were 12 billion in 2004 the fda granted approval for generic competition to synthroid and generic competitors have entered the market us sales of synthroid were 470 million in 2006 and 498 million in 2005 clarithromycin is now subject to generic competition in most european markets european market sales of clarithromycin in 2006 and 2005 were 329 million and 416 million respectively in the us clarithromycin is marketed in two forms the immediate release and the extended release forms in may 2005 the composition of matter patent on clarithromycin expired and several immediate release generic products were launched by competitors abbott holds noncomposition of matter patents for the extended release form of clarithromycin in december 2006 an extended release generic product was launched by a competitor the us district court of the northern district of illinois has denied abbott’s request for grant of a temporary restraining order against the competitor there may 

be further generic competition for clarithromycin in other countries in 2007 depending on the results of legal proceedings related to the patents upon the december 2005 expiration of a court order related to licenses for sevoflurane baxter is now permitted to market a competitive form of sevoflurane in addition sevoflurane has been subject to generic competition from other competitors in isolated markets outside of the us and further generic competition in international markets is possible worldwide sales of sevoflurane in 2006 and 2005 were 799 million and 874 million respectively the composition of matter patent for omnicef expires in may 2007 abbott holds an additional noncomposition of matter patent for omnicef  sales of omnicef in 2006 and 2005 were 637 million and 495 million respectively the pharmaceutical products segment markets all of the above products the patent for prevacid  which is licensed by tap pharmaceuticals tap expires in 2009 abbott records tap’s results on the equity method 

operating earnings 

gross profit margins were 563 percent of net sales in 2006 524 percent in 2005 and 549 percent in 2004 the increase in the gross profit margin in 2006 was due to favorable product mix primarily as a result of decreased sales of boehringer ingelheim products that have lower margins than for other products in the pharmaceutical products segment and the decrease in the gross profit margin in 2005 was due to unfavorable product mix primarily as a result of increased sales of boehringer ingelheim products restructuring charges discussed below reduced the gross profit margins in 2006 and 2005 by 11 percentage points and 08 percentage points respectively the gross profit margin in 2004 was impacted by the favorable mix effect of exchange on the gross profit margin and by unfavorable product mix primarily increased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products in the pharmaceutical products segment gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements higher project expenses for new products higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth and the effects of inflation 

in the us states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental food program for women infants and children there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional and pharmaceutical products segments in addition pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the nutritional products segment in 2006 2005 and 2004 

the gross profit margins for the pharmaceutical products segment were favorably impacted in 2006 and unfavorably impacted in 2005 and 2004 by product mix the favorable product mix in 2006 was due to decreased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products and the unfavorable product mix in 2005 and 2004 was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products and higher other manufacturing costs 

research and development expense excluding acquired inprocess and collaborations research and development was 23 billion in 2006 18 billion in 2005 and 17 billion in 2004 and represented increases of 238 percent in 2006 73 percent in 2005 and 45 percent in 2004 the effect of recording compensation expense relating to sharebased awards and additional costs associated with abbott’s decision to discontinue the commercial development of the zomaxx drugeluting stent increased research and development expenses by 63 percentage points over 2005 the remaining increase was due to the acquisition of guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and increased spending to support pipeline programs including followon indications for humira  and other latestage clinical programs in pharmaceuticals diabetes care and vascular the majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products  

selling general and administrative expenses increased 155 percent in 2006 compared to increases of 117 percent in 2005 and 24 percent in 2004 2006 includes the effect of recording compensation expense 

relating to sharebased awards a philanthropic contribution to the abbott fund and the acquisition of guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses these items increased selling general and administrative expenses by 86 percentage points over 2005 the restructuring charges discussed below and an increase in a bad debt reserve associated with an unfavorable court ruling increased the percent change from 2004 by 27 percentage points in 2005 in 2003 abbott recorded in selling general and administrative expenses a pretax charge of 614 million related to a settlement this 2003 charge reduced the increase in selling general and administrative expenses by 150 percentage points for 2004 the remaining increases in selling general and administrative expenses were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products including continued spending for humira  as well as spending on other marketed pharmaceutical products these increases also reflect the effects of the acquisitions of therasense and eas in 2004 increases in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the pharmaceutical products segment 

restructurings 

dollars in millions 

in 2006 and 2005 abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs in 2006 and 2005 abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately 210 and 256 respectively reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets employee severance and other related charges approximately 181 and 174 respectively is classified as cost of products sold 29 and 10 respectively as research and development and 72 in 2005 as selling general and administrative an additional 70 and 14 were subsequently recorded in 2006 and 2005 respectively relating to these restructurings primarily for accelerated depreciation as a result of product reregistration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries manufacturing related realignments are expected to continue into 2007 

the following summarizes the activity for restructurings 

 

  

abbott expects to incur up to an additional 128 in future periods for restructuring plans primarily for accelerated depreciation 

net interest expense 

net interest expense increased in 2006 due primarily to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisition of guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and abbott’s investments in the common stock of boston scientific and a note receivable partially offset by higher interest income 

other income expense net 

the increase in other income expense in 2006 is primarily due to fairvalue gain adjustments to certain derivative financial instruments related to the investment in boston scientific common stock 

taxes on earnings 

the effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were 246 percent in 2006 270 percent in 2005 and 230 percent in 2004 taxes on earnings in 2006 reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired inprocess and collaborations research and development and the resolution of prior years’ income tax audits and the effect of discrete tax events for 2006 the tax rates applied to acquired inprocess and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by 66 percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and discrete tax events decreased the effective tax rate by 55 percentage points in 2005 abbott remitted 43 billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the american jobs creation act of 2004 and recorded additional tax expense of 245 million which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 53 percentage points this was partially offset by adjustments of prior years’ tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years’ accrual requirements which decreased the effective tax rate by 23 percentage points the effective tax rate for 2004 reflects adjustments of prior years’ tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years’ tax audits and the effect of nondeductible acquired inprocess research and development the effect of these items for 2004 was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately 12 percentage points abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of approximately 225 percent in 2007 

spinoff of abbott’s core hospital products business 

in 2004 abbott’s board of directors declared a special dividend distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of hospira inc payable on april 30 2004 hospira included the operations relating to the manufacture and sale of hospital products including specialty injectable pharmaceuticals medication delivery systems and critical care devices and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing hospira included abbott’s hospital products segment after that segment’s reorganization on january 1 2004 and portions of the former international segment the income and cash flows of hospira and the direct transaction costs of the spinoff have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings and statement of cash flows 

abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spinoff defined benefit postemployment medical and dental plan obligations and assets as of the spinoff for most of hospira’s us retired employees and us retirement eligible employees and certain potential liabilities if any related to alleged improper pricing practices prior to the spinoff in connection with federal state and private reimbursement for certain drugs 

business combinations technology acquisitions and related transactions

acquired intangible assets will be amortized over 3 to 15 years average of approximately 10 years tax deductible acquired inprocess research and development was charged to income in 2006 the net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately 530 million trade accounts receivable of approximately 250 million and inventories of approximately 120 million net of assumed liabilities primarily trade accounts payable litigation reserves and other liabilities 

in order to facilitate boston scientific’s acquisition of guidant abbott also acquired 646 million shares of boston scientific common stock directly from boston scientific and loaned 900 million to a whollyowned subsidiary of boston scientific abbott is required to dispose of the shares by october 2008 sales of the shares are limited to approximately 54 million shares per month until october 2007 the amount recorded upon the acquisition of the shares includes a discount to market based on an appraisal to reflect the value of the restrictions on sale on the date of acquisition half of the shares were recorded as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 115 and the remainder under the cost method in accordance with apb no 18 as of december 31 2006 all of the shares are recorded as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 115 the loan which is due in april 2011 is guaranteed by boston scientific and bears a favorable effective interest rate of 4 percent which is reflected in the valuation of the note receivable in connection with the acquisition of the shares boston scientific is entitled to certain aftertax gains upon abbott’s sale of the shares abbott would retain any gains on the sale of the boston scientific shares up to a sales price of 2383 boston scientific would receive any aftertax gains on the sale of the shares for the portion of the sales price in excess of 2383 but lower than 2600 and boston scientific would receive onehalf of any aftertax gain for the portion of the sales price in excess of 2599 based on an appraisal abbott recorded approximately 114 million for this gainsharing derivative financial instrument liability in addition boston scientific agreed to reimburse abbott for certain borrowing costs on debt incurred to acquire the boston scientific shares after abbott incurs the first 10 million of interest cost on debt incurred to acquire the shares boston scientific will reimburse abbott for the next 60 million of interest cost reimbursement for the incremental interest cost will be in the form of additional common stock of boston scientific payable 18 months after the acquisition abbott recorded 

approximately 55 million for this interest derivative financial instrument asset the effect of recording the shares the loan to boston scientific and the derivative financial instruments at fair value on the date of acquisition resulted in the recording of additional goodwill of approximately 204 million the financial assets and liability acquired from boston scientific were valued and recorded at acquisition as follows in millions of dollars  

 

  

in 2005 abbott acquired the remaining interest in a small medical products company that was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting and a less than 50 percent equity interest in a small medical products company the aggregate cash purchase price was approximately 25 million acquisition accounting resulted in the recording of nontax deductible goodwill of approximately 69 million intangible assets of approximately 22 million and a charge of approximately 17 million for acquired inprocess research and development in 2005 abbott acquired additional rights related to humira for approximately 270 million which are being amortized over 13 years

had the above acquisitions taken place on january 1 of the previous year consolidated net sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts 

subsequent event — announced sales of businesses 

on january 18 2007 abbott announced that it had agreed to sell its core laboratory diagnostics business including abbott point of care to ge for 813 billion in cash the sale is expected to close in the first half of 2007 and is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities included in the sale is estimated to be approximately 26 billion and net sales for these businesses were approximately 27 billion in 2006 abbott estimates tax expense of approximately 20 billion will be recorded on the gain

financial condition 

cash flow 

net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to 53 billion 50 billion and 43 billion in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in cash from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is due to higher net earnings adjusted for aftertax noncash charges for acquired inprocess research and development and sharebased compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in 2005 compared to 2006 partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2006 including tax payments related to the 2005 remittances of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act in 2006 2005 and 2004 200 million 641 million and 482 million respectively was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of 200 million annually the increased contribution in 2005 was due in part to the investment of cash remitted under the american jobs creation act of 2004 abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbott’s capital expenditures and cash dividends 

debt and capital

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbott’s estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

  

a   purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements

contingent obligations 

abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business such as assignment of product rights with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these obligations based upon past experience the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote in addition abbott periodically acquires small companies or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds 

in connection with the acquisition of the common shares of boston scientific boston scientific is entitled to certain aftertax gains if any upon abbott’s sales of the boston scientific shares in addition abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spinoff of hospira and certain potential liabilities if any related to alleged improper pricing practices in connection with federal state and private reimbursement for certain drugs 

recently issued accounting standards 

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” this interpretation requires that a recorded tax benefit must be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by tax authorities based upon its technical merits the amount of benefit recorded is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement upon adoption any adjustment will be recorded directly to beginning retained earnings the interpretation is effective for abbott beginning no later than january 1 2007 abbott has not yet adopted the provisions of this interpretation the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on abbott’s january 1 2007 balance sheet or the 2007 provision for income taxes 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” the new statement establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 adoption of the provisions of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of abbott 

legislative issues 

in august 2006 the president of the united states signed the pension protection act of 2006 among other things the act establishes new minimum funding requirements for plan years beginning in 2008 abbott does not expect this act to significantly impact future fundings of its domestic defined benefit pension plans 

abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation throughout the world abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbott believes that if legislation is enacted it could have the effect of reducing access to health care products and services or reducing prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors on form 10k 

private securities litigation reform act of 1995 — a caution concerning forwardlooking statements
