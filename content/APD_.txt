except as otherwise noted the description of our business below reflects our continuing operations refer to note 5 discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements for activity associated with discontinued operations 

during the fiscal year ended 30 september 2022 “fiscal year 2022” we reported our continuing operations in five reporting segments under which we managed our operations assessed performance and reported earnings americas asia europe middle east and india and corporate and other the discussion that follows is based on those operations refer to note 23 business segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments 

industrial gases business 

our industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally our industrial gases business produces and sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon process gases such as hydrogen helium carbon dioxide co 2  carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and specialty gases atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent while process gases are produced by methods other than air separation for example hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas are produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons for the production of hydrogen we purify byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries today we primarily produce hydrogen from hydrocarbons without carbon capture our newer energy transition projects are focused on producing clean hydrogen from hydrocarbons with carbon capture known as “blue hydrogen” as well as from renewable energy known as “green hydrogen” helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs primarily natural gas but also co 2 purified before resale the industrial gases business also develops builds and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators 

the regional segments supply gases related equipment and applications in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in refining chemicals metals electronics manufacturing medical and food hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels as well as in the developing hydrogenformobility markets we have hydrogen fueling stations that support commercial markets as well as demonstration projects across the globe the chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals the energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen is used for inerting in various fields including the metals chemical and semiconductor industries helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance 

industrial gases are generally produced at or near the point of use given the complexity and inefficiency with storing molecules at low temperatures helium however is generally sourced globally at long distances from point of sale as a result we maintain an inventory of helium stored in our fleet of iso containers as well as at the us bureau of land management underground storage facility in amarillo texas and our storage cavern near beaumont texas 

we distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors including the customers volume requirements and location our supply modes are as follows 

• liquid bulk —product is delivered in bulk in either liquid or gaseous form via tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment that we typically design and install at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

• packaged gases —small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars we operate packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states our packaged gas business sells products principally helium only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries 

• onsite gases —large quantities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and syngas are provided to customers principally in the energy production and refining chemical metals and electronics industries worldwide that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand gases are produced and supplied by large facilities we construct or acquire on or near the customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities these sale of gas contracts are generally governed by 15 to 20year contracts we also deliver smaller quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically via a 10 to 15year sale of gas contract 

electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas we mitigate electricity natural gas and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough and tolling arrangements during fiscal year 2022 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas 

we obtain helium from a number of sources globally including crude helium for purification from the us bureau of land managements helium reserve 

the regional industrial gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for under the equity method our share of our investees net earnings is primarily presented net of income taxes within “equity affiliates’ income on our consolidated income statements the largest of these joint ventures operate in china india italy mexico saudi arabia south africa and thailand the carrying value of our equity method investments is reflected as investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates on our consolidated balance sheets 

each of the regional industrial gases segments competes against three global industrial gas companies air liquide sa messer and linde plc as well as regional competitors competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications we derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers 

overall regional industrial gases sales constituted approximately 92 92 and 94 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 43 47 and 47 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively while sales of tonnage hydrogen syngas and related products constituted approximately 28 22 and 22 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

industrial gases equipment 

we design and manufacture equipment for air separation hydrocarbon recovery and purification natural gas liquefaction and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage the corporate and other segment includes activity related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation the equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing oil and gas recovery and processing and steel and primary metals processing the corporate and other segment also includes our lng equipment business our gardner cryogenics business fabricating helium and hydrogen transport and storage containers and our rotoflow business which manufactures turboexpanders and other precision rotating equipment steel aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents such as compressors are the principal raw materials in the manufacturing of equipment raw materials for individual projects typically are acquired under firm purchase agreements equipment is produced at our manufacturing sites with certain components being procured from subcontractors and vendors competition in the equipment business is based primarily on plant efficiency service technical knowhow and price as well as schedule and plant performance guarantees sale of equipment constituted approximately 8 8 and 6 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

international operations 

through our subsidiaries affiliates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method we conduct business in approximately 50 countries outside the united states our international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls tariffs trade sanctions import and export controls and other economic political and regulatory policies of local governments described in item 1a risk factors  below 

we have majority or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in canada and approximately 20 countries in europe including the netherlands poland spain and the countries of the united kingdom approximately 10 countries and regions in asia including china south korea and taiwan approximately 10 countries in latin america including brazil and chile approximately five countries in the middle east including saudi arabia and israel and approximately five countries in africa we also own lessthancontrolling interests in entities operating in europe asia latin america the middle east and africa 

financial information about our foreign operations and investments is included in note 7 equity affiliates  note 21 income taxes  and note 23 business segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 below information about foreign currency translation is included under “foreign currency” in note 1 basis of presentation and major accounting policies  and information on our exposure to currency fluctuations is included in note 12 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 below and in “foreign currency exchange rate risk” included under item 7a below 

technology development 

we pursue a marketoriented approach to technology development through research and development engineering and commercial development processes we conduct research and development principally in our laboratories located in the united states allentown pennsylvania the united kingdom basingstoke and carrington spain barcelona china shanghai and saudi arabia dhahran we also fund and cooperate in research and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertake research work funded by others including the united states government 

development of technology for use within the industrial gases business focuses primarily on new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and new or improved applications for industrial gas products 

during fiscal year 2022 we owned approximately 674 united states patents approximately 3245 foreign patents and were a licensee under certain patents owned by others while the patents and licenses are considered important we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent patent license or group of patents or licenses 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various environmental laws regulations and public policies in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these measures often results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 basis of presentation and major accounting policies  and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 below 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases “ghg” including co 2  these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading system the california capandtrade program china’s emission trading scheme and its nationwide expansion and south korea’s emission trading scheme in the netherlands a co 2 emissions tax was enacted on 1 january 2021 in canada alberta’s technology innovation and emission reduction system went into effect 1 january 2020 in ontario environment  climate change canada’s output based pricing system “obps” was replaced by the ghg emissions performance standards eps program beginning 1 january 2022 in singapore the carbon pricing tax act was implemented effective 1 january 2019 in taiwan greenhouse gases emissions registration and verification management act will be enforced beginning in 2023 in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg emissions although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we see significant opportunities for hydrogen for mobility and energy transition carbon capture technologies and gasification 

we estimate that we spent approximately 10 million 8 million and 4 million in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately 11 million in both fiscal years 2023 and 2024

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations are affected by various risks many of which are beyond our control in evaluating investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere from time to time you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities the risks described below are not all inclusive but are designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations in addition to such risks there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

risks related to economic conditions 

the covid19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 global pandemic including resurgences and variants of the virus that causes covid19 and efforts to reduce its spread have led and may continue to lead to significant changes in levels of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets these factors have led and may continue to lead to reduced demand for industrial gas products particularly in our merchant business in addition covid19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses lower returns for certain of our projects and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline these effects may be exacerbated by actions by health or other governmental authorities to attempt to reduce the transmission of covid19 

further to the extent covid19 adversely affects our business financial condition and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 

changes in global and regional economic conditions the markets we serve or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues operating results and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past including most recently due to covid19 and may do so in the future in addition our growth strategy is largely based on demand for technologies and projects that limit the impact of global climate change demand for our solutions could be negatively impacted if public and private actors reduce their focus on reducing carbon emissions reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings in addition reduced demand could depress sales reduce our margins constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits 

in addition our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or the inability to recover plant investments any of which may negatively impact our financial results 

weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming onstream when expected these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political security legal and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability 

in fiscal year 2022 over 60 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states and many of our operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations import and trade restrictions trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions strained relations between countries or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states particularly in markets such as china india indonesia and the middle east and involve significantly larger and more complex projects including gasification and largescale hydrogen projects some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions we are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources in some cases through joint ventures in developing markets which we believe to have high growth potential our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including political and economic instability project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting training and retaining qualified employees in addition our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation respectively without full compensation for loss successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of war sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time 

furthermore because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates we choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below 

risks related to our business 

risks related to the approval execution and operation of our projects particularly with respect to our largest projects may adversely affect our operations or financial results 

a significant and growing portion of our business involves clean hydrogen carbon capture gasification and other largescale projects that involve challenging engineering procurement and construction phases that may last several years and involve the investment of billions of dollars these projects are technically complex often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities and face significant financing development operational and reputational risks these projects may also be subject to complex government approvals as well as legal or regulatory challenges by government authorities or third parties delays in receiving required approvals or related to litigation could require us to delay or abandon certain projects which may result in the incurrence of additional expense the loss of invested proceeds and reputational damage 

we may encounter difficulties in engineering delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party equipment and materials delivery delays schedule changes customer scope changes delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rightsofway inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants weatherrelated delays delays by customers contractors in completing their portion of a project technical or transportation difficulties cost overruns supply difficulties geopolitical risks and other factors many of which are beyond our control that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule in some cases delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to cancel a project andor compensate the customer for the delay we may not be able to recover any of these costs in addition in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing these financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which if not met could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses all of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers suppliers and other third parties any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future 

the operation of our facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures vehicle accidents or cyber incidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows in addition our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements which depend in part on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets 

we are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business regulations addressing among other things importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to government regulation in the united states and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business the application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability if there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional unplanned capital expenditures export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred in addition we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities 

further we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire 

we may be unable to successfully identify execute or effectively integrate acquisitions manage our joint ventures or effectively disentangle divested businesses 

our ability to grow revenue earnings and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices and realize expected growth synergies and operating efficiencies we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance in addition we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations 

in addition some of our largest projects involve joint ventures these arrangements may involve significant risks and uncertainties including our ability to cooperate with our strategic partners our strategic partners having interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and the potential that our strategic partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations to the joint venture which may negatively impact the expected benefits of the joint venture and cause us to incur additional expense or suffer reputational damage in addition due to the nature of these arrangements we may have limited ability to direct or influence the management of the joint venture which may limit our ability to assist and oversee the design and implementation of the joint venture’s business as well as its accounting legal governance human resources information technology and other administrative systems this may expose us to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon and subject to liability losses or reputational damage relating to systems controls and personnel that are not under our control these risks may be augmented when the joint venture is operating outside the united states due to differences in language culture and regulation as well as the factors listed above that are relevant to our international operations 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts distract management and give rise to disputes with buyers in addition we have agreed and may in the future agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate safely and efficiently and interface with our customers as well as to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions property damage or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach in addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability 

as with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase to date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in defective products or services physical damage to facilities pipelines or delivery systems including those we own or operate for third parties legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our internal control environment and internal control over financial reporting each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements 

our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information we also from time to time export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of our business because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity inflation and energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions the covid19 pandemic natural events or other disruption could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results 

our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics supplier operating or transportation issues or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers 

we typically contract to passthrough cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers but such cost passthrough results in declining margins and cost variability can negatively impact our other operating results for example we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs in addition increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

we are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation we may face difficulties marketing products produced using new technologies including but not limited to green hydrogen which may adversely impact our sales and financial results in addition certain largescale projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations additionally there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights 

as we develop new technologies it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against thirdparty infringement we own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services as we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests we may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against thirdparty infringement it is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm 

legal and regulatory risks 

legislative regulatory societal and market efforts to address global climate change may impact our business and create financial risk 

we are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen the primary use of which is the production of ultralow sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health to make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers we use steam methane reforming which produces carbon dioxide in addition gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and valueadded products however our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing ghg emissions including co2 which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations furthermore some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg emissions or increased demand for technologies and projects to limit the impact of global climate change although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

our operations may present a safety risk to our employees 

notwithstanding our emphasis on the safety of our employees and contractors and the precautions we take related to health and safety we may be unable to avoid safety incidents relating to our operations that result in injuries or deaths certain safety incidents may result in legal or regulatory action that could result in increased expenses or reputational damage we maintain workers compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or at all which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths changes to federal state and local employee health and safety regulations and legislative regulatory or societal responses to safety incidents may result in heightened regulations or public scrutiny that may increase our compliance costs or result in reputational damage 

our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material while we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 

costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect our financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see item 1 business–environmental regulation  above 

a change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows various levels of government including the us federal government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue further changes in tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

general risk factors 

catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers having a negative impact on our business financial results and cash flows 

our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics pandemics acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact our suppliers customers and partners which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results 

the united kingdom’s “uk” exit from european union “eu” membership could adversely affect our european operations 

although the uk’s exit from eu membership on 31 january 2021 brexit did not result in material disruptions to customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers or our european business the ultimate effects of brexit on us are still difficult to predict adverse consequences from brexit may include greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu members and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business overall 

inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

we face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of our products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including commercial competition environmental intellectual property regulatory product liability and insurance matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if compensatory andor punitive damages are awarded however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

we are a party to proceedings under cercla rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are 30 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where we usually along with others have been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position additional information on our environmental exposure is included under item 1 business–environmental regulation and note 16 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 33 million at 30 september 2022 on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice following an investigation beginning in 2003 which alleged violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 with the brazilian courts on 6 may 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against air products brasil ltda was dismissed cade has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending we with advice of our outside legal counsel have assessed the status of this matter and have concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements in the event of an adverse final judgment we estimate the maximum possible loss to be the full amount of the fine of r1792 million approximately 33 million at 30 september 2022 plus interest accrued thereon until final disposition of the proceedings 

additionally winter storm uri a severe winter weather storm in the us gulf coast in february 2021 disrupted our operations and caused power and natural gas prices to spike significantly in texas we remain in litigation of a dispute regarding energy management services related to the impact of this event and other disputes may arise from such power price increases in addition legislative action may affect power supply and energy management charges while it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs related to power supply and energy management services in texas related to the winter storm it is too early to estimate potential losses if any given significant unknowns resulting from the unusual nature of this event 

other than the matters discussed above we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures 

millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated except for per share data 

we present certain financial measures other than in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap on an adjusted or nongaap basis on a consolidated basis these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share eps adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted effective tax rate and capital expenditures on a segment basis these measures include adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in addition to these measures we also present certain supplemental nongaap financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items or nongaap adjustments have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted eps for each nongaap financial measure we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

in many cases nongaap financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap measure to exclude certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance or nongaap adjustments for example we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions impairment charges and gains on disclosed transactions the reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future 

when applicable the tax impact of our pretax nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our nongaap adjustments these tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions 

we provide these nongaap financial measures to allow investors potential investors securities analysts and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management we believe these measures when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results however we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with gaap readers should also consider the limitations associated with these nongaap financial measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another 

adjusted diluted eps 

the table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations which we view as a key performance metric in periods that we have nongaap adjustments we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance per share impacts are calculated independently and may not sum to total diluted eps and total adjusted diluted eps due to rounding 







adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income less income loss from discontinued operations net of tax and excluding certain items that we do not believe are indicative of underlying business trends before interest expense other nonoperating income expense net income tax provision and depreciation and amortization expense adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding 

the tables below present consolidated sales and a reconciliation of net income on a gaap basis to adjusted ebitda and net income margin on a gaap basis to adjusted ebitda margin

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash balance and cash flows from operations are our primary sources of liquidity and are generally sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in addition we have the flexibility to access capital through a variety of financing activities including accessing the capital markets drawing upon our credit facility or alternatively accessing the commercial paper markets at this time we have not utilized nor do we expect to access our credit facility for additional liquidity 

as of 30 september 2022 we had 16111 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of 27110 we do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to us income tax upon repatriation to the us depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes however since we have significant current investment plans outside the us it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the us 

cash flows from operations 



for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2022 cash provided by operating activities was 31706 undistributed earnings of equity method investments reflects activity from the jigpc joint venture which began contributing to our results in late october 2021 we received cash distributions of approximately 155 from this joint venture during the fiscal year other adjustments of 3049 included adjustments for noncash currency impacts of intercompany balances deferred costs associated with new projects contributions to pension plans and payments made for leasing activities the working capital accounts were a use of cash of 1158 primarily driven by a use of cash of 4752 from trade receivables less allowances 943 from inventory and 770 from other working capital partially offset by a source of cash of 5325 from payables and accrued liabilities the use of cash within trade receivables includes the impacts of higher natural gas costs contractually passed through to customers and higher underlying sales the source of cash within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs and customer advances for sale of equipment projects the use of cash within other working capital primarily relates to contract fulfillment costs and the timing of income tax payments 

for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021 cash provided by operating activities was 33352 other adjustments of 1167 included pension plan contributions of 446 and pension income of 389 that did not have a cash impact the working capital accounts were a source of cash of 167 primarily driven by a 1879 source of cash from payables and accrued liabilities partially offset by a 1305 use of cash from trade receivables less allowances the source of cash within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs which also drove the use of cash within trade receivables as we contractually passed through these higher costs to customers 

cash flows from investing activities 



for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2022 cash used for investing activities was 38572 capital expenditures primarily included 29265 for additions to plant and equipment including longterm deposits and 16584 for investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates refer to the capital expenditures section below for further detail proceeds from investments of 23774 resulted from maturities of time deposits and treasury securities with terms greater than three months but less than one year and exceeded purchases of investments of 16378

a includes contributions from noncontrolling partners in consolidated subsidiaries as discussed below 

capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 totaled 46500 compared to 25507 in fiscal year 2021 the increase of 20993 was primarily driven by our initial investment of 16 billion in the new jigpc joint venture which included approximately 130 from a noncontrolling partner in one of our subsidiaries we expect to make an additional investment of approximately 1 billion which will also include a contribution from our noncontrolling partner for the second phase of the project which we expect to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 refer to note 7 equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

outlook for investing activities 

we expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately 5 to 55 billion 

it is not possible without unreasonable efforts to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions these decisions either individually or in the aggregate could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities 

we anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance cash generated from continuing operations and financing activities as needed in addition we intend to continue to evaluate 1 investments in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy cleaner energy and emerging market growth 2 purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create longterm contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee and 3 acquisitions of small and mediumsized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies

credit facilities 

on 31 march 2021 we entered into a fiveyear 2500 revolving credit agreement maturing 31 march 2026 with a syndicate of banks the “2021 credit agreement” under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries on 31 march 2022 we amended the 2021 credit agreement to exercise our option to increase the maximum borrowing capacity to 2750 and transition the benchmark rate from the london interbank offered rate libor to the secured overnight financing rate sofr all other terms remain unchanged from the original agreement

pension benefits 

we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans are the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan these plans were closed to new participants in 2005 after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions refer to note 15 retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

net periodic benefit 

the table below summarizes the components of net periodic benefit for our us and international defined benefit pension plans for the fiscal years ended 30 september 



net periodic benefit of 36 decreased from 373 in the prior year primarily due to lower nonservice related benefits we increased the percentage of fixed income investments within the plan asset portfolios which resulted in lower expected returns on plan assets for both the us salaried and the uk pension plans additionally a higher discount rate resulted in higher interest costs these two reductions in nonservice related benefits were only partially offset by lower actuarial loss amortization our nonservice related benefits are reflected within other nonoperating income expense net on our consolidated income statements 

service costs result from benefits earned by active employees and are reflected as operating expenses primarily within cost of sales and selling and administrative on our consolidated income statements the amount of service costs capitalized in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was not material 

the table below summarizes the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit for the fiscal years ended 30 september 



2023 outlook 

in fiscal year 2023 we expect to recognize pension expense of approximately 110 to 120 primarily driven by nonservice related costs including higher interest cost and lower estimated expected returns on plan assets due to a smaller beginning balance of plan assets 

in fiscal year 2022 we recognized net actuarial losses of 1435 in other comprehensive income actuarial gains and losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets could impact the actuarial gain or loss and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2023 

effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 management will review and disclose our adjusted results excluding the impact of nonservice related costs as they are not indicative of the plans’ future contribution needs due to the funded status of the plans nonservice related costs are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations such as recent changes to the allocation of our pension plan assets associated with derisking as well as volatility in equity and debt markets 

pension funding 

funded status 

the projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date including the effects of estimated future salary increases the plan funded status is calculated as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at the end of the period 

the table below summarizes the project benefit obligation the fair value of plan assets and the funded status for our us and international plans as of 30 september 



the net unfunded liability of 623 as of 30 september 2022 increased 61 from 562 as of 30 september 2021 primarily due to unfavorable asset experience partially offset by a lower liability due to increased discount rates 

company contributions 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of thirdparty actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2022 and 2021 our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 447 and 446 respectively 

funding outlook 

for fiscal year 2023 cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 25 to 35 the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans which are dependent upon the timing of retirements actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

refer to note 1 basis of presentation and major accounting policies  and note 2 new accounting guidance  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance 

the accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain these estimates reflect our best judgment about current andor future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements if conditions change actual results may differ materially from these estimates our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

plant and equipment net at 30 september 2022 totaled 141605 and depreciation expense totaled 13027 during fiscal year 2022 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially when business circumstances change for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products excessive wear and tear or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

our regional segments have numerous longterm customer supply contracts for which we construct an onsite plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset 

our regional segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and for smaller customers packaged gases the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc 

in addition we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets the remaining duration of longterm supply contracts served by the assets and our historical experience with similar assets management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

impairment of assets 

there were no triggering events in fiscal year 2022 that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups reporting units that contain goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles assets we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 we recorded a noncash charge of 148 for the otherthantemporary impairment of two small equity method investments in our asia segment 

refer to the “impairment of assets” subsections below for additional detail 

impairment of assets – plant and equipment 

plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign governmentimposed restrictions or expropriations plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances may include 

• a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping 

• a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition 

• an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the longlived asset 

• a reduction in revenues that is other than temporary 

• a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or 

• changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows 

the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

in fiscal year 2022 there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of our asset groupings may not be recoverable 

impairment of assets – goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity goodwill was 8230 as of 30 september 2022 disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 9 goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 

we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly we have five reportable business segments seven operating segments and 11 reporting units eight of which include a goodwill balance refer to note 23 business segment and geographic information  for additional information reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value however we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we initially use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of estimated future cash flows our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capitalintensive nature the longterm contractual nature of our business and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates operating profit andor adjusted ebitda margins discount rate and exit multiple projected revenue growth rates and operating profit andor adjusted ebitda assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan andor revised forecasts and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate reflects expected longterm growth rates 

if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment when the market approach is utilized fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies andor regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects when both the income and market approach are utilized we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test noting no indications of impairment the fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value 

future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include but are not limited to longterm economic weakness decline in market share pricing pressures inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures increases to our cost of capital changes in the strategy of the reporting unit and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses negative changes in one or more of these factors among others could result in impairment charges 

impairment of assets – intangible assets 

intangible assets net with determinable lives at 30 september 2022 totaled 3144 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under  impairment of assets – plant and equipment  for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2022 totaled 331 and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss to determine fair value we utilize the royalty savings method a form of the income approach this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset 

disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in note 10 intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 

in the fourth quarter of 2022 we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangibles which resulted in no impairment 

impairment of assets – equity method investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 33538 at 30 september 2022 the majority of our investments are ventures with other industrial gas companies summarized financial information of our equity affiliates is included in note 7 equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements we review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

an impairment loss is recognized in the event that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs we estimate the fair value of our investments under the income approach which considers the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee andor the market approach which considers market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gas companies changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 we determined there was an otherthantemporary impairment of our investments in two small equity affiliates in the asia segment as a result we recorded a noncash charge of 148 111 aftertax or 005 per share to write down the full carrying value of the investments this charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “equity affiliates income” and was not recorded in segment results there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of our other investments may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition – cost incurred input method 

revenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use we use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations costs incurred include material labor and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer 

accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance schedule delays technical issues cost inflation labor productivity the complexity of work performed the availability of materials and performance of subcontractors when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inceptiontodate effect of such change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities our sale of equipment projects within our corporate and other segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule geography and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract 

changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately 30 in fiscal year 2022 and 19 in fiscal year 2021 our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years 

we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

revenue recognition – onsite customer contracts 

for customers who require large volumes of gases on a longterm basis we produce and supply gases under longterm contracts from large facilities that we build own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities certain of these onsite contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements minimum payment requirements variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled as of 30 september 2022 accrued income taxes including the amount recorded as noncurrent was 2698 and net deferred tax liabilities were 11117 tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2022 were 1035 excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2022 was 5008 disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 21 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in income tax expense 

a 1 increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income respectively of approximately 28 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions expense and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 15 retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the us and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates mortality rates are based on the most recent us and international mortality tables we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans we measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows the rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date these rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense with respect to impacts on pension benefit obligations a 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase respectively to pension expense of approximately 20 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the longterm average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations in determining estimated asset class returns we take into account historical and future expected longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase respectively to pension expense of approximately 23 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur and reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for nonequity investments equals the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense respectively of approximately 7 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1 basis of presentation and major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and details are provided in note 16 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased a different remediation alternative is identified or our proportionate share of the liability increases similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies refer to note 1 basis of presentation and major accounting policies  and note 12 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 13 fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements our net financial instrument position decreased from a liability of 78503 at 30 september 2021 to a liability of 68986 at 30 september 2022 the decrease was primarily due to the effect of higher interest rates on the fair value of us dollar and eurodenominated fixedrate debt and the effect of a stronger us dollar on foreign currencydenominated debt 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date such as interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatility 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2022 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 79 fixedrate debt and 21 variablerate debt our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2021 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 89 fixedrate debt and 11 variablerate debt the increase in variablerate debt is primarily the result of a 600 million increase in the outstanding notional of fixedtovariable interest rate swaps 

the sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2022 with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 364 and 587 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2022 and 2021 respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 425 and 692 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2022 and 2021 respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 16 and 8 of interest incurred per year at 30 september 2022 and 2021 respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 16 and 8 per year at 30 september 2022 and 2021 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2022 and 2021 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 165 and 343 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2022 and 2021 respectively the lower decrease or increase from a 10 strengthening or weakening respectively was primarily due to the origination of project cost hedges that generate losses and increase the net liability position when the functional currency strengthens or generate gains and decrease the net liability position when the functional currency weakens 

the primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the euro and us dollar and chinese renminbi and us dollar foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

the majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the united states therefore financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the chinese renminbi and the euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings we estimate that a 10 reduction in either the chinese renminbi or the euro versus the us dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 45 and 25 respectively

as used in this report unless the context indicates otherwise the terms “we” “our” “us” the “company” air products or “registrant” include controlled subsidiaries affiliates and predecessors of air products and our controlled subsidiaries and affiliates 

except as otherwise noted the description of our business below reflects our continuing operations refer to note 5 discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements for activity associated with discontinued operations 

table of contents 

during the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021 “fiscal year 2021” we reported our continuing operations in five reporting segments under which we managed our operations assessed performance and reported earnings industrial gases – americas industrial gases – emea europe middle east and africa industrial gases – asia industrial gases – global and corporate and other the discussion that follows is based on those operations refer to note 23 business segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments 

on 4 november 2021 we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments effective 1 october 2021 refer to note 24 subsequent events  for additional information 

industrial gases business 

our industrial gases business produces atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon process gases such as hydrogen helium carbon dioxide co 2  carbon monoxide and syngas and specialty gases atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent process gases are produced by methods other than air separation for example hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas are produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons hydrogen is produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs primarily natural gas but also co 2 purified before resale the industrial gases business also develops builds and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators 

our industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally the regional industrial gases segments supply gases related equipment and applications in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in refining chemicals metals electronics manufacturing and food and beverage hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels as well as in the developing hydrogenformobility markets we have hydrogen fueling stations that support commercial markets in california and japan as well as demonstration projects in europe saudi arabia and other parts of asia the chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals the energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen is used for inerting in various fields including the metals chemical and semiconductor industries helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance 

industrial gases are generally produced at or near the point of use given the complexity and inefficiency with storing molecules at low temperatures helium however is generally sourced globally at long distances from point of sale as a result we maintain an inventory of helium stored in our fleet of iso containers as well as at the us bureau of land management underground storage facility in amarillo texas

we distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors including the customers volume requirements and location our supply modes are as follows 

• liquid bulk —product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment that we typically design and install at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

• packaged gases —small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars we operate packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states our packaged gas business sells products principally helium only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries 

• onsite gases —large quantities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are provided to customers principally in the energy production and refining chemical and metals industries worldwide that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand gases are produced and supplied by large facilities we construct or acquire on or near the customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities these sale of gas contracts are generally governed by 15 to 20year contracts we also deliver smaller quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically via a 10 to 15year sale of gas contract 

electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas we mitigate electricity natural gas and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough and tolling arrangements during fiscal year 2021 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas 

we obtain helium from a number of sources globally including crude helium for purification from the us bureau of land managements helium reserve 

the regional industrial gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method which we report in our financial statements as income from equity affiliates the largest of these joint ventures operate in china india italy mexico saudi arabia south africa and thailand 

each of the regional industrial gases segments competes against three global industrial gas companies air liquide sa messer and linde plc as well as regional competitors competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications we derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers 

overall regional industrial gases sales constituted approximately 92 94 and 96 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 47 47 and 46 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively while sales of tonnage hydrogen syngas and related products constituted approximately 22 22 and 26 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

our backlog of equipment orders was approximately 13 billion on 30 september 2021 as compared to a total backlog of approximately 16 billion on 30 september 2020 we estimate that approximately half of the total equipment sales backlog as of 30 september 2021 will be recognized as revenue during fiscal year 2022 dependent on execution schedules of the relevant projects 

international operations 

through our subsidiaries affiliates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method we conduct business in 53 countries outside the united states our international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls tariffs trade sanctions and import and export controls and other economic political and regulatory policies of local governments described in item 1a risk factors  below 

we have majority or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in canada 18 european countries including the netherlands spain and the united kingdom 11 asian countries including china south korea and taiwan seven latin american countries including brazil and chile six countries in the middle east including saudi arabia and three african countries we also own lessthancontrolling interests in entities operating in europe asia latin america the middle east and africa including china india italy mexico oman saudi arabia south africa and thailand 

financial information about our foreign operations and investments is included in note 7 summarized financial information of equity affiliates  note 21 income taxes  and note 23 business segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 below information about foreign currency translation is included under “foreign currency” in note 1 major accounting policies  and information on our exposure to currency fluctuations is included in note 12 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 below and in “foreign currency exchange rate risk” included under item 7a below 

technology development 

we pursue a marketoriented approach to technology development through research and development engineering and commercial development processes we conduct research and development principally in our laboratories located in the united states trexlertown pennsylvania the united kingdom basingstoke and carrington spain barcelona china shanghai and saudi arabia dhahran we also fund and cooperate in research and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertake research work funded by others including the united states government 

development of technology for use within the industrial gases business focuses primarily on new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and new or improved applications for industrial gas products 

during fiscal year 2021 we owned approximately 780 united states patents approximately 3480 foreign patents and were a licensee under certain patents owned by others while the patents and licenses are considered important we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent patent license or group of patents or licenses

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various environmental laws regulations and public policies in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these measures often results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies  and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 below 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases “ghg” including co 2  these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading system the california capandtrade program china’s emission trading scheme and its nationwide expansion and south korea’s emission trading scheme in the netherlands a co 2 emissions tax was enacted on 1 january 2021 in canada alberta’s technology innovation and emission reduction system went into effect 1 january 2020 in ontario environment  climate change canada’s output based pricing system “obps” is currently in effect however effective 1 january 2022 ontario’s ghg emissions performance standards program will be used in lieu of adherence to the obps in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg emissions although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we see significant opportunities for gasification carbon capture technologies and hydrogen for mobility and energy transition 

we estimate that we spent approximately 8 million 4 million and 5 million in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately 8 million in both fiscal years 2022 and 2023

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations are affected by various risks many of which are beyond our control in evaluating investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere from time to time you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities the risks described below are not all inclusive but are designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations in addition to such risks there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

risks related to economic conditions 

the covid19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 global pandemic including resurgences and variants of the virus that causes covid19 and efforts to reduce its spread have led and may continue to lead to significant changes in levels of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets these factors have led and may continue to lead to reduced demand for industrial gas products particularly in our merchant business in addition covid19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses lower returns for certain of our projects and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline 

in addition we are monitoring the health of our employees and many of our employees including those based at our headquarters are working remotely in accordance with health safety guidance and applicable governmental orders action by health or other governmental authorities requiring the closure of our facilities recommending other physical distancing measures or mandating vaccination against covid19 could negatively impact our business and those of our service providers and customers although we have business continuity and other safeguards in place we cannot be certain that they will be fully effective for extended periods of time 

table of contents 

as the pandemic and responses to it continue to evolve we may experience further adverse impacts on our operations and our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all may be impaired in addition we may face unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products when restrictions on business and travel end if demand for our products exceeds our capacity it could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships although the duration and ultimate impact of these factors is unknown at this time the decline in economic conditions due to covid19 or another diseasecausing similar impacts may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and such impact may be material 

further to the extent covid19 adversely affects our business financial condition and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 

changes in global and regional economic conditions the markets we serve or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues operating results and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past including most recently due to covid19 and may do so in the future reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings in addition reduced demand could depress sales reduce our margins constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits 

in addition our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or the inability to recover plant investments any of which may negatively impact our financial results 

weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming onstream when expected these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political security legal and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability 

in fiscal year 2021 over 60 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states and many of our operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations import and trade restrictions trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions strained relations between countries or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

table of contents 

our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states particularly in markets such as china india indonesia and the middle east and involve significantly larger and more complex projects including gasification and largescale hydrogen projects some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions we are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources in some cases through joint ventures in developing markets which we believe to have high growth potential our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including political and economic instability project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting training and retaining qualified employees in addition our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation respectively without full compensation for loss successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of war sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time 

furthermore because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates we choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below 

risks related to our business 

operational and project execution risks particularly with respect to our largest projects may adversely affect our operations or financial results 

a significant and growing portion of our business involves gasification and other largescale projects that involve challenging engineering procurement and construction phases that may last up to several years and involve the investment of billions of dollars these projects are technically complex often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities and face significant financing development operational and reputational risks we may encounter difficulties in engineering delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party equipment and materials delivery delays schedule changes customer scope changes delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rightsofway inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants weatherrelated delays delays by customers contractors in completing their portion of a project technical or transportation difficulties cost overruns supply difficulties geopolitical risks and other factors many of which are beyond our control that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule in some cases delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to cancel a project andor compensate the customer for the delay we may not be able to recover any of these costs in addition in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing these financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which if not met could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses all of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers suppliers and other third parties any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future 

the operation of our facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures vehicle accidents or cyber incidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows in addition our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements which depend in part on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets 

table of contents 

we are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business regulations addressing among other things importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to government regulation in the united states and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business the application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability if there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional unplanned capital expenditures export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred in addition we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities 

further we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire 

we may be unable to successfully identify execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or effectively disentangle divested businesses 

our ability to grow revenue earnings and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices and realize expected growth synergies and operating efficiencies we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance in addition we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts distract management and give rise to disputes with buyers in addition we have agreed and may in the future agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate safely and efficiently and interface with our customers as well as to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions property damage or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach in addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability 

as with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase to date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in defective products or services physical damage to facilities pipelines or delivery systems including those we own or operate for third parties legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our internal control environment and internal control over financial reporting each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements 

our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information we also from time to time export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of our business because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity inflation and energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions the covid19 pandemic natural events or other disruption could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results 

our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics supplier operating or transportation issues or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers 

table of contents 

we typically contract to passthrough cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers but such cost passthrough results in declining margins and cost variability can negatively impact our other operating results for example we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs in addition increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

we are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation in addition gasification and other largescale projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations additionally there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts for gasification projects 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights 

as we develop new technologies it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against thirdparty infringement we own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services as we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests we may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against thirdparty infringement it is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm 

legal and regulatory risks 

legislative regulatory and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk 

we are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen the primary use of which is the production of ultralow sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health to make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers we use steam methane reforming which produces carbon dioxide in addition gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and valueadded products however our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing ghg emissions including co 2  which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations furthermore some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg emissions although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

table of contents 

our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material while we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 

costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect our financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see item 1 business–environmental regulation  above 

a change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows various levels of government including the us federal government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue further changes in tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including commercial competition environmental intellectual property regulatory product liability and insurance matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if compensatory andor punitive damages are awarded however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

we are a party to proceedings under cercla rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are 31 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where we along with others have been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position additional information on our environmental exposure is included under item 1 business–environmental regulation and note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 33 million at 30 september 2021 on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice following an investigation beginning in 2003 which alleged violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in brazil in 2003 

table of contents 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 with the brazilian courts on 6 may 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against air products brasil ltda was dismissed cade has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending we with advice of our outside legal counsel have assessed the status of this matter and have concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements in the event of an adverse final judgment we estimate the maximum possible loss to be the full amount of the fine of r1792 million approximately 33 million at 30 september 2021 plus interest accrued thereon until final disposition of the proceedings 

additionally winter storm uri a severe winter weather storm in the us gulf coast in february 2021 disrupted our operations and caused power and natural gas prices to spike significantly in texas we are currently in the early stages of litigation of a dispute regarding energy management services related to the impact of this unusual event and other disputes may arise from such power price increases in addition legislative action may affect power supply and energy management charges while it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs related to power supply and energy management services in texas related to the winter storm it is too early to estimate potential losses if any given significant unknowns resulting from the unusual nature of this event 

other than the matters discussed above we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

changes in diluted eps attributable to air products 

the per share impacts presented in the table below were calculated independently and may not sum to the total change in diluted eps due to rounding 



a despite higher sales volumes the volume impact on diluted eps was flat due to reduced contributions from our 60owned joint venture with luan clean energy company that we consolidate within our industrial gases – asia segment refer to the sales discussion below for additional detail the volume impact from the luan facility is partially offset by the positive impact of lower net income being attributed to our joint venture partner within noncontrolling interests

2022 outlook 

the guidance below should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements of this annual report on form 10k 

we believe our achievements in 2021 are just the beginning of our journey providing gasification carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility solutions to address the world’s most significant energy and environmental sustainability challenges for example we expect our worldscale jazan gasification project with aramco acwa power and air products qudra to begin contributing to our results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 we expect to continue to pursue new highreturn opportunities that are aligned with our growth strategy and to add the resources necessary for project development and execution we remain committed to creating shareholder value through capital deployment and delivering increased dividends as we have done for the past 39 consecutive years 

the duration and extent of ongoing global challenges such as rising energy costs energy consumption curtailment and supply chain disruptions remain uncertain for our merchant business we plan to continue pricing actions to recover higher energy costs we expect to add new projects to our onsite business model which has contractual protection from energy cost fluctuations and generates stable cash flow we expect higher costs from planned maintenance activities on our facilities in fiscal year 2022 and higher pension expense resulting from lower expected returns on assets 

additionally we expect the lu’an facility to continue operating under the interim agreement discussed below through fiscal year 2022 

in fiscal year 2022 we will also continue to focus on our other sustainability goals including our commitment to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions intensity and advance diversity and inclusion 

on 4 november 2021 we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments including the separation of our industrial gases – emea segment into two separate reporting segments industrial gases – europe and industrial gases – middle east the results of an affiliate formerly reflected in the industrial gases – asia segment will now be reported in the industrial gases – middle east segment additionally the results of our industrial gases – global operating segment will be reflected in the corporate and other segment beginning with our quarterly report on form 10q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 segment results will be presented on a retrospective basis to reflect the reorganization

lu’an clean energy company “lu’an” a longterm onsite customer in asia with which we have a consolidated joint venture restarted its facility in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 following successful completion of major maintenance work in september 2020 our facility resumed operations and the joint venture is supplying product at reduced charges as agreed upon with luan under a shortterm agreement reached in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 as a result of this agreement we recognized lower revenue in our industrial gases – asia segment in each quarter of fiscal year 2021 we expect this shortterm reduction in charges to extend through fiscal year 2022 

cost of sales and gross margin 

total cost of sales of 72093 including the facility closure discussed below increased 23 or 13512 the increase from the prior year was primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost passthrough to customers of 479 higher costs associated with sales volumes of 433 unfavorable currency impacts of 233 and higher costs including power and other cost inflation of 183 gross margin of 302 decreased 370 bp from 339 in the prior year primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost passthrough to customers higher costs and the reduced luan contribution partially offset by the positive impact of our pricing actions 

facility closure 

in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 we recorded a charge of 232 174 aftertax or 008 per share primarily for a noncash writedown of assets associated with a contract termination in the industrial gases – americas segment this charge is reflected as facility closure on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021 and was not recorded in segment results 

selling and administrative

other nonoperating income expense net 

other nonoperating income of 737 increased 430 we recorded higher nonservice pension income in 2021 due to lower interest costs and higher total assets primarily for our us pension plans the current year also included favorable currency impacts these factors were partially offset by lower interest income on cash and cash items due to lower interest rates

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 185 and 197 for the fiscal years ended 30 september 2021 and 2020 respectively the current year rate was lower primarily due to income tax benefits of 215 recorded upon expiration of the statute of limitations for tax reserves previously established for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years this included a benefit of 122 005 per share for release of reserves established in 2017 for a tax election related to a nonus subsidiary and other previously disclosed items tax election benefit and other refer to note 21 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures 

millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated except for per share data 

we present certain financial measures other than in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap on an adjusted or nongaap basis on a consolidated basis these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share eps adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted effective tax rate and capital expenditures on a segment basis these measures include adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in addition to these measures we also present certain supplemental nongaap financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items or nongaap adjustments have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted eps for each nongaap financial measure we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

our nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap we believe these nongaap financial measures provide investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our business because such measures when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results 

in many cases nongaap financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap measure to exclude nongaap adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance for example we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions impairment charges and gains on disclosed transactions the reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future readers should also consider the limitations associated with these nongaap financial measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another 

when applicable the tax impact of our pretax nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our nongaap adjustments these tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions

the table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations which we view as a key performance metric in periods that we have nongaap adjustments we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance the per share impact for each nongaap adjustment was calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted eps due to rounding

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income less income loss from discontinued operations net of tax and excluding nongaap adjustments which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends before interest expense other nonoperating income expense net income tax provision and depreciation and amortization expense adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding

reconciliations to consolidated results 

the table below reconciles consolidated operating income as reflected on our consolidated income statements to total operating income in the table above for the fiscal years ended 30 september 



the table below reconciles consolidated equity affiliates income as reflected on our consolidated income statements to total equity affiliates income in the table above for the fiscal years ended 30 september 



adjusted effective tax rate 

the effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes 

when applicable the tax impact of our pretax nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our nongaap adjustments these tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions

capital expenditures 

we define capital expenditures as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment acquisitions less cash acquired and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates a reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below 



liquidity and capital resources 

our cash balance and cash flows from operations are our primary sources of liquidity and are generally sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in addition we have the flexibility to access capital through a variety of financing activities including accessing the capital markets drawing upon our credit facility or alternatively accessing the commercial paper markets at this time we have not utilized nor do we expect to access our credit facility for additional liquidity in addition we have considered the impacts of covid19 on our liquidity and capital resources and do not expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs 

as of 30 september 2021 we had 15904 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of 44689 we do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to us income tax upon repatriation to the us depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes however since we have significant current investment plans outside the us it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the us 

cash flows from operations 



for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021 cash provided by operating activities was 33352 other adjustments of 1167 included pension plan contributions of 446 and pension income of 389 that did not have a cash impact the working capital accounts were a source of cash of 167 primarily driven by a 1879 source of cash from payables and accrued liabilities partially offset by a 1305 use of cash from trade receivables less allowances the source of cash within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs which also drove the use of cash within trade receivables as we contractually passed through these higher costs to customers 

table of contents 

for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020 cash provided by operating activities was 32647 we recorded a net benefit of 135 on our consolidated income statements related to a recently enacted tax law in india during the second quarter this net benefit which is further discussed in note 21 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements increased undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates by 338 and increased deferred income taxes by 203 the gain on sale of assets and investments of 458 includes a gain of 338 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters refer to note 22 supplemental information  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the working capital accounts were a use of cash of 401 primarily driven by other working capital uses of 1306 partially offset by a source of 844 from other receivables the use of cash within other working capital was primarily due to timing of tax payments and a tax benefit as a result of the assets acquired in april 2020 from pbf energy inc the source of cash within other receivables was primarily driven by maturities of forward exchange contracts 

cash flows from investing activities 



for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021 cash used for investing activities was 27329 capital expenditures for plant and equipment including longterm deposits were 24642 purchases of investments with terms greater than three months but less than one year of 21007 exceeded proceeds from investments of 18752 which resulted from maturities of time deposits and treasury securities 

for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020 cash used for investing activities was 35600 payments for additions to plant and equipment including longterm deposits were 25090 this includes the acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from pbf energy inc in delaware and california for approximately 580 additionally acquisitions less cash acquired includes 1833 for three businesses we acquired on 1 july 2020 the largest of which was a business in israel that primarily offers merchant gas products refer to note 3 acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information purchases of investments of 28655 related to time deposits and treasury securities with terms greater than three months and less than one year and exceeded proceeds from investments of 19380 proceeds from sale of assets and investments of 803 included net proceeds of 441 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures is a nongaap financial measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment including longterm deposits acquisitions less cash acquired and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates the components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below we present a reconciliation of our capital expenditures to cash used for investing activities on page 36 



capital expenditures in fiscal year 2021 totaled 25507 compared to 27167 in fiscal year 2020 the decrease of 1660 was primarily driven by the prior year acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from pbf partially offset by lower spending for acquisitions additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine ongoing nature including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements 

table of contents 

outlook for investing activities 

we expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 to be approximately 45 to 5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 we paid 16 billion including approximately 130 from a noncontrolling partner in one of our subsidiaries for the initial investment in the jazan gasification and power project we expect to make an additional investment of approximately 1 billion which includes contribution from our noncontrolling partner for phase ii of the project in 2023 refer to note 24 subsequent events  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

it is not possible without unreasonable efforts to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions these decisions either individually or in the aggregate could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities 

we anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations in addition we intend to continue to evaluate 1 acquisitions of small and mediumsized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies 2 purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create longterm contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee and 3 investment in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy cleaner energy and emerging market growth 

cash flows from financing activities 



in fiscal year 2021 cash used for financing activities was 14209 and primarily included dividend payments to shareholders of 12567 and payments on longterm debt of 4629 partially offset by longterm debt proceeds of 1789 and investments by noncontrolling interests of 1366 the payments on longterm debt included the repayment of a €3500 million eurobond 428 in june 2021 

in november 2021 we repaid our 30 senior note of 400 plus interest on its maturity date 

in fiscal year 2020 cash provided by financing activities was 32847 as we successfully accessed the debt markets in april 2020 to support opportunities for growth projects and repay upcoming debt maturities longterm debt proceeds of 48958 were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of 11036 and payments on longterm debt of 4066 primarily related to the repayment of a 20 eurobond of €3000 million 3539 that matured on 7 august 2020 other financing activities were a use of cash of 972 and included financing charges associated with the third quarter debt issuance 

financing and capital structure 

capital needs in fiscal year 2021 were satisfied with cash from operations total debt decreased from 79078 as of 30 september 2020 to 76372 as of 30 september 2021 primarily due to repayment of the €350 million eurobond partially offset by proceeds from longterm borrowings on our foreign commitments total debt includes related party debt of 3584 and 3385 as of 30 september 2021 and 30 september 2020 respectively primarily associated with the luan joint venture for additional detail refer to note 14 debt  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 

on 31 march 2021 we entered into a fiveyear 2500 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the “2021 credit agreement” under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries the 2021 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program the only financial covenant in the 2021 credit agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to capitalization equal to total debt plus total equity not to exceed 70 total debt as of 30 september 2021 and 30 september 2020 expressed as a percentage of total capitalization was 352 and 389 respectively no borrowings were outstanding under the 2021 credit agreement as of 30 september 2021 

the 2021 credit agreement replaced our previous fiveyear 23000 revolving credit agreement which was to have matured on 31 march 2022 no borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement as of 30 september 2020 or at the time of its termination no early termination penalties were incurred 

commitments of 2967 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries 1762 of which was borrowed and outstanding as of 30 september 2021 

as of 30 september 2021 we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 

on 15 september 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 of our outstanding common stock we did not purchase any of our outstanding shares in fiscal years 2021 or 2020 as of 30 september 2021 4853 in share repurchase authorization remains 

dividends 

cash dividends on our common stock are paid quarterly usually during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter we expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future at comparable or increased levels 

the board of directors determines whether to declare dividends and the timing and amount based on financial condition and other factors it deems relevant in 2021 the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on our common stock to 150 per share representing a 12 increase from the previous dividend of 134 per share this is the 39 th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment 

on 18 november 2021 the board of directors declared the first quarter 2022 dividend of 150 per share the dividend is payable on 14 february 2022 to shareholders of record as of 3 january 2022 

discontinued operations 

in fiscal year 2021 cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of 67 resulted from cash received as part of a state tax settlement related to the sale of pmd in fiscal year 2017 

pension benefits 

we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans are the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan these plans were closed to new participants in 2005 after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2021 measurement date increased to 52487 from 47751 at the end of fiscal year 2020 the projected benefit obligation for these plans was 53049 and 53735 at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively the net unfunded liability decreased 5422 from 5984 to 562 primarily due to favorable asset experience refer to note 15 retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

table of contents 

pension expense 



we recognized pension income of 373 in fiscal year 2021 versus expense of 70 in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to lower interest cost and higher total assets special items decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses 

2022 outlook 

in fiscal year 2022 we expect pension impacts to range from 5 million of income to 5 million of expense which includes potential settlement losses of 5 to 10 million depending on the timing of retirements this forecast reflects a lower expected estimated return on assets due to the increased percentage of fixed income investments within the plan asset portfolios and higher interest cost partially offset by lower forecasted actuarial loss amortization in fiscal year 2022 our expected range of pension impacts includes approximately 80 for amortization of actuarial losses 

in fiscal year 2021 pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of 978 net actuarial gains of 3608 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2021 actuarial gains and losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets could impact the actuarial gain or loss and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2022 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of thirdparty actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2021 and 2020 our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 446 and 375 respectively 

for fiscal year 2022 cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 40 to 50 the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans which are dependent upon the timing of retirements actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors we do not expect covid19 to impact our contribution forecast for fiscal year 2022

critical accounting policies and estimates 

refer to note 1 major accounting policies  and note 2 new accounting guidance  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance 

the accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain these estimates reflect our best judgment about current andor future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements if conditions change actual results may differ materially from these estimates our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

plant and equipment net at 30 september 2021 totaled 132546 and depreciation expense totaled 12841 during fiscal year 2021 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially when business circumstances change for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products excessive wear and tear or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

the regional industrial gases segments have numerous longterm customer supply contracts for which we construct an onsite plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset 

our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and for smaller customers packaged gases the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc 

in addition we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets the remaining duration of longterm supply contracts served by the assets and our historical experience with similar assets management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change

impairment of assets 

as discussed below there were no triggering events in fiscal year 2021 that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups reporting units that contain goodwill indefinitelived intangibles assets or equity method investments we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment 

impairment of assets – plant and equipment 

plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign governmentimposed restrictions or expropriations plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include 1 a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping 2 a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition 3 an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the longlived asset 4 a reduction in revenues that is other than temporary 5 a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or 6 changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows 

the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

in fiscal year 2021 there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of our asset groupings may not be recoverable 

impairment of assets – goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity goodwill was 9115 as of 30 september 2021 disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 9 goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 

we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly we have five reportable business segments seven operating segments and ten reporting units seven of which include a goodwill balance refer to note 23 business segment and geographic information  for additional information reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value however we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

table of contents 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we initially use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of estimated future cash flows our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capitalintensive nature the longterm contractual nature of our business and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates operating profit andor adjusted ebitda margins discount rate and exit multiple projected revenue growth rates and operating profit andor adjusted ebitda assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan andor revised forecasts and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate reflects expected longterm growth rates 

if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment when the market approach is utilized fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies andor regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects when both the income and market approach are utilized we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test noting no indications of impairment the fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value 

due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 october 2021 we conducted an additional impairment test on our existing reporting units as of 30 september 2021 the fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 september 2021 

future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include but are not limited to longterm economic weakness decline in market share pricing pressures inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures increases to our cost of capital changes in the strategy of the reporting unit and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses negative changes in one or more of these factors among others could result in impairment charges 

impairment of assets – intangible assets 

intangible assets net with determinable lives at 30 september 2021 totaled 3804 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under  impairment of assets – plant and equipment  for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2021 totaled 403 and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss to determine fair value we utilize the royalty savings method a form of the income approach this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset 

disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in note 10 intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangibles which resulted in no impairment 

table of contents 

impairment of assets – equity method investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 16493 at 30 september 2021 the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 7 summarized financial information of equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

an impairment loss is recognized in the event that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach andor market approach we utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach for the market approach we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

in fiscal year 2021 there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition – cost incurred input method 

revenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use we use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations costs incurred include material labor and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer 

accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance schedule delays technical issues labor productivity the complexity of work performed the cost and availability of materials and performance of subcontractors when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inceptiontodate effect of such change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities our sale of equipment projects within our industrial gases – global segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule geography and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract 

changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately 19 in fiscal year 2021 as compared to a favorable impact of 7 in fiscal year 2020 our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years 

we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

revenue recognition – onsite customer contracts 

for customers who require large volumes of gases on a longterm basis we produce and supply gases under longterm contracts from large facilities that we build own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities certain of these onsite contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements minimum payment requirements variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

table of contents 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled as of 30 september 2021 accrued income taxes including the amount recorded as noncurrent was 2510 and net deferred tax liabilities were 10807 tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2021 were 1403 excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021 was 4628 disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 21 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income respectively of approximately 25 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions expense and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 15 retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the us and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates mortality rates are based on the most recent us and international mortality tables we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans we measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows the rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date these rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense respectively of approximately 20 per year 

table of contents 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the longterm average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations in determining estimated asset class returns we take into account historical and future expected longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense respectively of approximately 23 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur and reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for nonequity investments equals the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense respectively of approximately 7 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and details are provided in note 16 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased a different remediation alternative is identified or our proportionate share of the liability increases similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies refer to note 1 major accounting policies  and note 12 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 13 fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 

our net financial instrument position decreased from a liability of 82207 at 30 september 2020 to a liability of 78503 at 30 september 2021 the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of a €3500 million eurobond 428 on its maturity date in june 2021 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date such as interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2021 and 2020 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 89 fixedrate debt and 11 variablerate debt 

the sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2021 with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 587 and 711 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2021 and 2020 respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 692 and 846 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2021 and 2020 respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 8 of interest incurred per year at 30 september 2021 and 2020 a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 8 per year at 30 september 2021 and 2020 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2021 and 2020 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 343 and 360 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the euro and us dollar and chinese renminbi and us dollar foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

the majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the united states therefore financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the chinese renminbi and the euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings we estimate that a 10 reduction in either the chinese renminbi or the euro versus the us dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 45 and 25 respectively

 item 1 business 

air products and chemicals inc a delaware corporation originally founded in 1940 serves customers globally with a unique portfolio of products services and solutions that include atmospheric gases process and specialty gases equipment and services we are the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and have built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and liquefied natural gas lng process technology and equipment we also develop engineer build own and operate some of the world’s largest industrial gas projects including gasification projects that sustainably convert abundant natural resources into syngas for the production of highvalue power fuels and chemicals carbon capture projects and worldscale carbonfree hydrogen projects supporting global transportation and the energy transition 

as used in this report unless the context indicates otherwise the terms “we” “our” “us” the “company” air products or “registrant” include controlled subsidiaries affiliates and predecessors of air products and our controlled subsidiaries and affiliates 

during the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020 “fiscal year 2020” we reported our continuing operations in five reporting segments under which we managed our operations assessed performance and reported earnings industrial gases – americas industrial gases – emea europe middle east and africa industrial gases – asia industrial gases – global and corporate and other 

except as otherwise noted the description of our business below reflects our continuing operations refer to note 6 discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements for activity associated with discontinued operations 

industrial gases business 

our industrial gases business produces atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon process gases such as hydrogen helium carbon dioxide co 2  carbon monoxide and syngas and specialty gases atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent process gases are produced by methods other than air separation for example hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas are produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons hydrogen is produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries and helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs primarily natural gas but also co 2 purified before resale the industrial gases business also develops builds and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators 

table of contents 

our industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally the regional industrial gases segments americas emea and asia supply gases and related equipment in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in refining chemical gasification metals electronics manufacturing and food and beverage hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels as well as in the developing mobility markets the chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals the energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the gasification steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen for inerting is used in various fields including the metals chemical and semiconductor industries helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance 

industrial gases are generally produced at or near the point of use given the complexity and inefficiency with storing molecules at low temperatures helium however is generally sourced globally at long distances from point of sale as a result we maintain an inventory of helium stored in our fleet of iso containers as well as the us bureau of land management underground storage facility in amarillo texas 

we distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors including the customers volume requirements and location our supply modes are as follows 

• liquid bulk — product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment that we typically design and install at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

• packaged gases — small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars we operate packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states our packaged gas business sells products principally helium only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries 

• onsite gases — large quantities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are provided to customers principally in the energy production and refining chemical gasification and metals industries worldwide that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by 15 to 20 year contracts we also deliver small quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically either via a 10 to 15 year sale of gas contract or through the sale of the equipment to the customer 

electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas we mitigate electricity natural gas and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough and tolling arrangements during fiscal year 2020 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas 

we obtain helium from a number of sources globally including crude helium for purification from the us bureau of land managements helium reserve 

the regional industrial gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method which are reported in our financial statements as income from equity affiliates the largest of these joint ventures operate in china india italy mexico saudi arabia south africa and thailand 

table of contents 

each of the regional industrial gases segments competes against three global industrial gas companies air liquide sa messer and linde plc the successor to praxair inc and linde ag pursuant to a combination that became effective on 31 october 2018 as well as regional competitors competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications we derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers 

overall regional industrial gases sales constituted approximately 94 96 and 94 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 47 46 and 46 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively while sales of tonnage hydrogen syngas and related products constituted approximately 22 26 and 25 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

industrial gases equipment 

we design and manufacture equipment for air separation hydrocarbon recovery and purification natural gas liquefaction and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage the industrial gases – global segment includes activity related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation the equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing oil and gas recovery and processing and steel and primary metals processing the corporate and other segment includes three global equipment businesses our lng equipment business our gardner cryogenics business fabricating helium and hydrogen transport and storage containers and our rotoflow business which manufactures turboexpanders and other precision rotating equipment steel aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents compressors etc are the principal raw materials in the manufacturing of equipment raw materials for individual projects typically are acquired under firm purchase agreements equipment is produced at our manufacturing sites with certain components being procured from subcontractors and vendors competition in the equipment business is based primarily on technological performance service technical knowhow price and performance guarantees sale of equipment constituted approximately 6 4 and 6 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the backlog of equipment orders was approximately 16 billion on 30 september 2020 as compared to a total backlog of approximately 09 billion on 30 september 2019 we estimate that approximately 50 of the total equipment sales backlog as of 30 september 2020 will be recognized as revenue during fiscal year 2021 dependent on execution schedules of the relevant projects 

international operations 

through our subsidiaries affiliates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method we conduct business in 53 countries outside the united states our international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls tariffs trade sanctions and import and export controls and other economic political and regulatory policies of local governments described in item 1a risk factors below 

we have majority or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in canada 18 european countries including the netherlands spain and the united kingdom 11 asian countries including china south korea and taiwan seven latin american countries including brazil and chile six countries in the middle east including saudi arabia and three african countries we also own lessthancontrolling interests in entities operating in europe asia latin america the middle east and africa including china germany india italy mexico oman saudi arabia south africa and thailand

technology development 

we pursue a marketoriented approach to technology development through research and development engineering and commercial development processes it conducts research and development principally in its laboratories located in the united states trexlertown pennsylvania the united kingdom basingstoke and carrington spain barcelona china shanghai and saudi arabia dhahran we also fund and cooperate in research and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertake research work funded by others including the united states government 

development of technology for use within the industrial gases business focuses primarily on new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and new or improved applications for industrial gas products 

during fiscal year 2020 we owned approximately 850 united states patents approximately 3600 foreign patents and were a licensee under certain patents owned by others while the patents and licenses are considered important we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent patent license or group of patents or licenses 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies  and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 below 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases “ghg” including co 2  these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading system the california cap and trade scheme china’s emission trading scheme and its nationwide expansion and south korea’s emission trading scheme in the netherlands a co 2 emissions tax will come into force on 1 january 2021 in canada alberta’s technology innovation and emission reduction “tier” system went into effect 1 january 2020 in ontario environment  climate change canada’s eccc” output based pricing system “obps” is currently in effect however on 20 september 2020 eccc granted approval of ontario’s ghg emissions performance standards program which will be used in lieu of adherence to the obps with the effective date to be determined in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg emissions although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we see significant opportunities for gasification carbon capture technologies and hydrogen for mobility and energy transition 

we estimate that we spent approximately 4 million 5 million and 3 million in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately 6 million in both fiscal years 2021 and 2022

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations are affected by various risks many of which are beyond our control in evaluating investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities in addition to the following risks there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

risks related to economic conditions 

the covid19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 global pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have led to a significant decline of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets these factors have led to reduced demand for industrial gas products particularly in our merchant business we expect demand to continue to be impacted as well as the timing of certain planned maintenance activities in addition covid19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses lower returns for certain of our projects and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline in addition we are monitoring the health of our employees and many of our employees including those based at our headquarters are working remotely in accordance with health safety guidance and applicable governmental orders action by health or other governmental authorities requiring the closure of our facilities or recommending other physical distancing measures could negatively impact our business and those of our service providers and customers although we have business continuity and other safeguards in place we cannot be certain that they will be fully effective for extended periods of time as the pandemic and responses to it continue to evolve we may experience further adverse impacts on our operations and our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all may be impaired in addition we may face unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products when restrictions on business and travel end if demand for our products exceeds our capacity it could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships although the duration and ultimate impact of these factors is unknown at this time the decline in economic conditions due to covid19 or another diseasecausing similar impacts may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and such impact may be material 

further to the extent covid19 adversely affects our business financial condition and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 

table of contents 

changes in global and regional economic conditions the markets we serve or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues operating results and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past including most recently due to covid19 and may do so in the future reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings in addition reduced demand could depress sales reduce our margins constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits 

in addition our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or the inability to recover plant investments any of which may negatively impact our financial results 

weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or other inabilities to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming onstream when expected these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political security legal and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability 

in fiscal year 2020 over 60 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states and many of our operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations import and trade restrictions trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions strained relations between countries or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states particularly in markets such as china india indonesia and the middle east and involve significantly larger and more complex projects including gasification projects some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions we are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources in some cases through joint ventures in developing markets which we believe to have high growth potential our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including political and economic instability project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting training and retaining qualified employees in addition our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation respectively without full compensation for loss successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of war sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time 

table of contents 

furthermore because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates we choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below

a significant and growing portion of our business involves gasification and other largescale projects that involve challenging engineering procurement and construction phases that may last up to several years these projects are technically complex often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities and face significant financing development operational and reputational risks we may encounter difficulties in engineering delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party equipment and materials delivery delays schedule changes customer scope changes delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rightsofway inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants weatherrelated delays delays by customers contractors in completing their portion of a project technical or transportation difficulties cost overruns supply difficulties geopolitical risks and other factors many of which are beyond our control that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule in some cases delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to cancel a project andor compensate the customer for the delay we may not be able to recover any of these costs in addition in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing these financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which if not met could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses all of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers suppliers and other third parties any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future 

the operation of our facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows in addition our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements which depend in part on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets 

we are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business regulations addressing among other things importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to government regulation in the united states and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business the application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability if there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional unplanned capital expenditures export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred in addition we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities

further we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire 

we may be unable to successfully identify execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or effectively disentangle divested businesses  

our ability to grow revenue earnings and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices and realize expected growth synergies and operating efficiencies we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance in addition we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts distract management and give rise to disputes with buyers in addition we have agreed and may in the future agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain our internal controls environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach in addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability 

as with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase to date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our internal controls environment and internal controls over financial reporting each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements 

table of contents 

our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information we also from time to time export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of our business because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results 

our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics supplier operating or transportation issues or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers 

we typically contract to passthrough cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on our results we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

we are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation in addition large scale gasification projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations additionally there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts for gasification projects 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights 

as we develop new technologies it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against thirdparty infringement we own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services as we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests we may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against thirdparty infringement it is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm

legal and regulatory risks 

legislative regulatory and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk 

we are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen the primary use of which is the production of ultralow sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health to make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers we use steam methane reforming which releases carbon dioxide in addition although gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and valueadded products our gasification projects will increase our carbon footprint because the gasification process produces carbon dioxide some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing ghg emissions including co 2  which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations furthermore some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg emissions although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material while we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 

costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect our financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see item 1 business–environmental regulation  above

a change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in december 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which significantly revised the us federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on accumulated unremitted nonus earnings of foreign subsidiaries various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue further changes in tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff of versum qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from versum and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the spinoff is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

general risk factors 

catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers having a negative impact on our business financial results and cash flows 

our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics pandemics acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact our suppliers customers and partners which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results 

the united kingdom’s “uk” exit from european union “eu” membership could adversely affect our european operations 

the uk’s exit from eu membership may adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu members and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business overall 

inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

we face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of our products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including commercial competition environmental intellectual property regulatory product liability and insurance matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if compensatory andor punitive damages are awarded however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

we are a party to proceedings under cercla rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are 31 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where we along with others have been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position additional information on our environmental exposure is included under item 1 business–environmental regulation and note 17 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 32 million at 30 september 2020 on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts on 6 may 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against air products brasil ltda was dismissed cade has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending we with advice of our outside legal counsel have assessed the status of this matter and have concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

other than the cade matter discussed above we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

2021 outlook 

as covid19 continues we remain focused on the safety and wellbeing of our people we are committed to safely maintaining plant operations and ensuring business continuity including providing financial security for employees reliably supplying critical products and services to our customers and winning new opportunities for worldscale projects 

we expect lower volumes from covid19 to continue into fiscal year 2021 with recovery in demand depending on the duration of covid19 and measures implemented by governments public health authorities and businesses to mitigate its spread given the dynamic nature of these circumstances the future impact on our ongoing business results of operations and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated 

despite the uncertainty of the duration of covid19 we will continue to focus on pricing discipline in our merchant business and expect our onsite business model which represents approximately half of our business to continue generating stable cash flow this will allow us to execute our strategic focus on our industrial gas business and the creation of longterm shareholder value including the ongoing growth of our dividend continued execution of projects in our backlog and new investments in highreturn industrial gas projects 

a longterm onsite customer in asia delayed restarting their plant following a planned major maintenance turnaround completed in september 2020 while we expect the plant to restart in fiscal year 2021 we are negotiating with the customer regarding contract terms that could impact sales in our industrial gases – asia segment 

the above guidance should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements of this annual report on form 10k

sales 



a includes the impact from the modification of a hydrogen supply contract to a tolling arrangement in india in december 2018 the india contract modification 

sales of 88563 decreased 1 or 626 as higher pricing of 3 and favorable volumes of 2 were more than offset by lower energy and natural gas cost passthrough to customers of 4 unfavorable currency of 1 and the impact from the india contract modification of 1 the pricing improvement was attributable to our merchant business across the regional segments the volume growth exceeded the negative impacts from covid19 and was primarily driven by acquisitions new plants and higher sale of equipment project activity we estimate that covid19 negatively impacted overall sales by approximately 4 primarily driven by lower volumes in our merchant business across the regional segments as our onsite business remained stable unfavorable currency impacts were driven by the chilean peso chinese renminbi euro and south korean won 

cost of sales and gross margin 

cost of sales of 58581 decreased 2 or 1464 from total cost of sales of 60045 in the prior year which included the facility closure further discussed below the decrease from the prior year was driven by lower energy and natural gas cost passthrough to customers of 314 positive currency impacts of 73 the favorable impact from the india contract modification of 41 and the prior year facility closure of 29 partially offset by higher costs attributable to sales volumes of 250 and higher other costs including planned maintenance of 61 gross margin of 339 increased 120 bp from 327 in the prior year primarily due to positive pricing lower energy and natural gas cost passthrough to customers and the prior year facility closure partially offset by unfavorable volume mix and net operating costs 

facility closure 

in fiscal year 2019 one of our customers was subject to a government enforced shutdown due to environmental reasons as a result we recognized a charge of 290 221 aftertax or 010 per share primarily related to the writeoff of onsite assets this charge was reflected as “facility closure” on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2019 and was not recorded in segment results

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures 

millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated except for per share data 

we present certain financial measures other than in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap on an adjusted or nongaap basis on a consolidated basis these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share eps adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted effective tax rate on a segment basis these measures include adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in addition to these measures we also include certain supplemental nongaap financial measures that are presented below to help the reader understand the impact that our nongaap adjustments have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted eps for each nongaap financial measure we present below a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

our nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap we believe these nongaap financial measures provide investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our business because such measures when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results 

in many cases nongaap financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap measure to exclude certain disclosed items or “nongaap adjustments” that we believe are not representative of underlying business performance for example we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions impairment charges and gains on disclosed transactions the reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future readers should also consider the limitations associated with these nongaap financial measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another 

the tax impact on our pretax nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our nongaap adjustments these tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions

adjusted diluted eps 

the table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations which we view as a key performance metric we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of our nongaap adjustments as management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance the per share impact for each nongaap adjustment was calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted eps due to rounding 



a beforetax impact of 50 is reflected on the consolidated income statements within “other nonoperating income expense net”

pension benefits 

we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans are the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan these plans were closed to new participants in 2005 after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2020 measurement date increased to 47751 from 45048 at the end of fiscal year 2019 the projected benefit obligation for these plans was 53735 and 51456 at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively the net unfunded liability decreased 424 from 6408 to 5984 primarily due to favorable asset experience refer to note 16 retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

pension expense 



pension expense decreased from the prior year due to lower interest cost and higher total assets partially offset by higher actuarial loss amortization due to the impact of lower discount rates special items settlements termination benefits and curtailments decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses in fiscal year 2020 special items of 52 included pension settlement losses of 50 related to lump sum payouts from the us supplementary pension plan these amounts are reflected within other nonoperating income expense net on the consolidated income statements in fiscal year 2019 special items of 72 included pension settlement losses of 64 related to lump sum payouts from the us supplementary pension plan and 08 of termination benefits 

uk lloyds equalization ruling 

on 26 october 2018 the united kingdom high court issued a ruling related to the equalization of pension plan participants’ benefits for the gender effects of guaranteed minimum pensions as a result of this ruling we estimated the impact of retroactively increasing benefits in our uk plan in accordance with the high court ruling we treated the additional benefits as a prior service cost which resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss of 47 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 we are amortizing this cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the uk participants 

2021 outlook 

in fiscal year 2021 we expect pension income of approximately 25 to 35 which includes expected pension settlement losses of 0 to 5 depending on the timing of retirements the expected income range reflects lower expected interest cost and higher total assets in fiscal year 2021 we expect our net pension income to include approximately 100 for amortization of actuarial losses 

in fiscal year 2020 pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of 1032 net actuarial losses of 835 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2020 actuarial gains losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains losses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2021 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of thirdparty actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2020 and 2019 our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 375 and 402 respectively 

for fiscal year 2021 cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 45 to 55 the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans which are dependent upon the timing of retirements actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors we do not expect covid19 to impact our contribution forecast for fiscal year 2021 refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 38 for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

as discussed above in item 1 “ business–environmental regulation ” we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations which results in higher capital expenditures and costs the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 183 and 142 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet our internal standards we estimate that we spent approximately 4 and 5 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution we expect that our capital expenditures to control pollution will be approximately 6 in both fiscal years 2021 and 2022 

our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in addition we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

see note 23 supplemental information  to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning activity with our related parties 

inflation 

we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

table of contents 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2020 totaled 119647 and depreciation expense totaled 11505 during fiscal year 2020 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially when business circumstances change for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products excessive wear and tear or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

the regional industrial gases segments have numerous longterm customer supply contracts for which we construct an onsite plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm supply contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset 

our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and for smaller customers packaged gases the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc 

in addition we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets the remaining duration of longterm supply contracts served by the assets and our historical experience with similar assets management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change

impairment of assets 

while our results of operations have been negatively affected by covid19 as of and for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020 there have been no triggering events that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups reporting units that contain goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or equity method investments as further discussed below we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded there were no indications of impairment we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of covid19 impacts on our business and any impact they may have on managements estimates particularly those for our latin america business the duration and severity of the covid19 outbreak and its longterm impact on our business is uncertain 

impairment of assets – plant and equipment 

plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign governmentimposed restrictions or expropriations plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the longlived asset a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows 

the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

in fiscal year 2020 there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset groupings may not be recoverable 

impairment of assets – goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity goodwill was 8915 as of 30 september 2020 disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10 goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 

we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly we have five reportable business segments seven operating segments and ten reporting units seven of which include a goodwill balance refer to note 25 business segment and geographic information  for additional information reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments 

table of contents 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value however we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we initially use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of estimated future cash flows our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capitalintensive nature the longterm contractual nature of our business and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates operating profit andor adjusted ebitda margins discount rate and exit multiple projected revenue growth rates and operating profit andor adjusted ebitda assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan andor revised forecasts and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate reflects expected longterm growth rates 

if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment when the market approach is utilized fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies andor regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects when both the income and market approach are utilized we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except for our latin america reporting unit lasa which is further discussed below substantially all of the remaining goodwill balance related to reporting units in which the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 100 

the fair value of lasa exceeded its carrying value by 10 revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value we determined that with other assumptions held constant a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 320 basis points or a decrease in adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 290 basis points would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being equal to its carrying value as of 30 september 2020 the carrying value of lasa goodwill was 561 or less than 1 of consolidated total assets the carrying value of lasas other material assets at 30 september 2020 included plant and equipment net of 3092 customer relationships of 1121 and trade names and trademarks of 382 the trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets 

future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include but are not limited to longterm economic weakness decline in market share pricing pressures inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures increases to our cost of capital changes in the strategy of the reporting unit and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses negative changes in one or more of these factors among others could result in impairment charges

impairment of assets – intangible assets 

intangible assets net with determinable lives at 30 september 2020 totaled 3948 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under  impairment of assets – plant and equipment  for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2020 totaled 410 and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss to determine fair value we utilize the royalty savings method a form of the income approach this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset 

disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in note 11 intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangibles which resulted in no impairment 

impairment of assets – equity method investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 14322 at 30 september 2020 the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8 summarized financial information of equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

an impairment loss is recognized in the event that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach andor market approach we utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach for the market approach we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

in fiscal year 2020 there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition – cost incurred input method 

revenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use we use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations costs incurred include material labor and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer 

accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance schedule and technical issues labor productivity the complexity of work performed the cost and availability of materials and performance of subcontractors when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inceptiontodate effect of such change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

table of contents 

in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities our sale of equipment projects within our industrial gases – global segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule geography and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract 

changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method including the jazan project favorably impacted operating income by approximately 7 and 37 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years 

we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

revenue recognition – onsite customer contracts 

for customers who require large volumes of gases on a longterm basis we produce and supply gases under longterm contracts from large facilities that we build own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities certain of these onsite contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements minimum payment requirements variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled as of 30 september 2020 accrued income taxes including the amount recorded as noncurrent was 2967 and net deferred tax liabilities were 8475 tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2020 were 2370 excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020 was 4784 disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 22 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income respectively of approximately 24

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 16 retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the us and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates mortality rates are based on the most recent us and international mortality tables we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans we measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows the rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date these rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense respectively of approximately 26 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the longterm average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations in determining estimated asset class returns we take into account historical and future expected longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense respectively of approximately 22 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets for equities this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur and reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for nonequity investments equals the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense respectively of approximately 12 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

table of contents 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and details are provided in note 17 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased a different remediation alternative is identified or our proportionate share of the liability increases similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies refer to note 1 major accounting policies  and note 13 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 14 fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements our net financial instrument position increased from a liability of 32391 at 30 september 2019 to a liability of 82207 at 30 september 2020 due to the issuance of the 38 billion us dollardenominated notes and €10 billion eurobonds in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 see note 15 debt  for additional information 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date such as interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2020 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 89 fixedrate debt and 11 variablerate debt our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2019 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 74 fixedrate debt and 26 variablerate debt the increase in fixed rate debt is the result of the us dollar and eurodenominated notes issued during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 

the sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2020 with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 711 and 75 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2020 and 2019 respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 846 and 80 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 

table of contents 

september 2020 and 2019 respectively the longer maturities and increased principal associated with the us dollar and eurodenominated notes issued during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 created a higher sensitivity to market interest rates 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 8 of interest incurred per year at 30 september 2020 and 2019 a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 8 per year at 30 september 2020 and 2019 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2020 and 2019 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 360 and 326 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the euro and us dollar and chinese renminbi and us dollar foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

the majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the united states therefore financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the chinese renminbi and the euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings we estimate that a 10 reduction in either the chinese renminbi or the euro versus the us dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 40 and 25 respectively

industrial gases business 

the company’s industrial gases business produces atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon process gases such as hydrogen helium carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and syngas and specialty gases atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent process gases are produced by methods other than air separation for example hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas are produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons hydrogen is produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries and helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs primarily natural gas but also carbon dioxide purified before resale the industrial gases business also develops builds and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators 

the company’s industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally the regional industrial gases segments americas emea and asia supply gases and related equipment in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in refining chemical gasification metals electronics manufacturing and food and beverage hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels the chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals the energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the gasification steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen for inerting is used in various fields including the metals chemical and semiconductor industries helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance 

we distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors including the customers volume requirements and location our supply modes are as follows 

liquid bulk— product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed typically by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases— small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states the company’s packaged gas business sells products principally helium only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries 

onsite gases— large quantities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are provided to customers principally in the energy production and refining chemical gasification and metals industries worldwide that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by 15 to 20 year contracts the company also delivers small quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically either via a 10 to 15 year sale of gas contract or through the sale of the equipment to the customer 

electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas we mitigate electricity natural gas and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough and tolling arrangements during fiscal year 2019  no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas 

the company obtains helium from a number of sources globally including crude helium for purification from the us bureau of land managements helium reserve 

the regional industrial gases segments also include our interests in the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method which are reported in our financial statements as income from equity affiliates the largest of these joint ventures operate in mexico italy south africa india saudi arabia and thailand 

each of the regional industrial gases segments competes against two global industrial gas companies air liquide sa and linde plc the successor to praxair inc and linde ag pursuant to a combination that became effective on 31 october 2018 as well as regional competitors competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications we derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers 

overall regional industrial gases sales constituted approximately 96  94  and 90 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 46  46  45 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively while sales of tonnage hydrogen syngas and related products constituted approximately 26  25  and 24 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations are affected by various risks many of which are beyond our control in evaluating investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should consider the following risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

changes in global and regional economic conditions the markets we serve or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues operating results and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings in addition reduced demand could depress sales reduce our margins constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to the company resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or inability to recover plant investments any of which may negatively impact our financial results 

weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or default or other inabilities to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming onstream these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end 

market product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political security legal and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability 

in fiscal year 2019  over 60 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states and many of our operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations import and trade restrictions trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions strained relations between countries or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states particularly in highergrowth markets such as china india russia and the middle east and involve significantly larger and more complex projects including gasification projects some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions we are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources in some cases through joint ventures in developing markets with high growth potential our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including political and economic instability project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting training and retaining qualified employees our contracts in these locations may be subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time 

because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates we choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below 

operational and project execution risks may adversely affect our operations or financial results 

gasification and other large projects involve challenging engineering procurement and construction phases that may occur in more risky locations and over extended time periods sometimes up to several years these projects are large scale and technically complex and as a result face greater development and operational risks we may encounter difficulties in engineering delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party equipment and materials delivery delays schedule changes customer scope changes delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rightsofway inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants weatherrelated delays delays by customers contractors in completing their portion of a project technical or transportation difficulties cost overruns and other factors many of which are beyond our control that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule in some cases delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to cancel a project andor compensate the customer for the delay we may not be able to recover any of these costs in addition in some cases we seek limited recourse financing for certain large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing these financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which if not met could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses all of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts in the future 

the operation of our facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows in addition our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements which depend in part on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets 

we are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business regulations addressing among other things importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to government regulation in the united states and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business the application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability if there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional capital expenditures export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred in addition we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities 

further we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents business partners or businesses that we acquire that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire 

we may be unable to successfully identify execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or effectively disentangle divested businesses 

our ability to grow revenue earnings and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices and realize expected growth synergies and operating efficiencies we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance in addition we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts distract management and give rise to disputes with buyers in addition we have agreed and may in the future agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnities 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach in addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability 

as with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase to date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our accounting for transactions each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements 

our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information we also from time to time export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of our business because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results 

our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics supplier operating or transportation issues or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers 

we typically contract to passthrough cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on our results we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers having a negative impact on our business financial results and cash flows 

our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact our suppliers or customers which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results 

new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

we are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation in addition large scale gasification projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts for gasification projects 

legislative regulatory and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk 

we are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen the primary use of which is the production of ultralow sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health to make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers we use steam methane reforming which releases carbon dioxide in addition although gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and valueadded products our gasification projects will increase our carbon footprint because the gasification process produces carbon dioxide some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs including carbon dioxide these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading system the california cap and trade scheme china’s emission trading scheme and its nationwide expansion and south korea’s emission trading scheme in canada alberta and ontario are both in the developmentapproval process for new ghg regulations alberta’s carbon competitiveness incentive regulation will end december 31 2019 and will be replaced by the proposed technology innovation and emission reduction tier system or environment  climate change canadas output based pricing system obps in lieu of adherence to the obps ontario seeks approval from environment  climate change canada to implement their proposed ghg emissions performance standards program in addition the us environmental protection agency epa requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material while we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 

costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see item 1 business–environmental controls  above 

implementation of the united kingdom’s “uk” exit from european union “eu” membership could adversely affect our european operations 

the uk’s exit from eu membership may adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu members and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business 

inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

we face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of our business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of our products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share 

a change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in december 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which significantly revised the us federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on unremitted cumulative nonus earnings of foreign subsidiaries various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue further changes in tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff of versum qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from versum and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the spinoff is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including commercial competition environmental intellectual property regulatory product liability and insurance matters  although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if compensatory andor punitive damages are awarded however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

the company is a party to proceedings under cercla rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are 31 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under item 1 business–environmental controls  

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 43 million at 30 september 2019  on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts on 6 may 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against air products brasil ltda was dismissed cade has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

in november 2019 the company finalized a consent order with the city of santa clara ca “city” to address certain alleged administrative violations at its santa clara facility the consent order requires the company to pay the city approximately 6 million to settle the allegations which includes an enforcement penalty and funding for various supplemental environmental and training projects 

other than the cade matter discussed above we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures 

millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated except for per share data 

the company presents certain financial measures on a nongaap “adjusted” basis on a consolidated basis these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share eps adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted effective tax rate on a segment basis these measures include adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in addition to these measures which are presented above we also include certain supplemental nongaap financial measures that are presented below to help the reader understand the impact that our nongaap adjustments have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted eps for each nongaap financial measure we present below a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

the companys nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap the company believes these nongaap measures provide investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the companys historical financial performance and projected future results 

in many cases nongaap measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap measure to exclude certain disclosed items or “nongaap adjustments” that the company believes are not representative of underlying business performance for example the company previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions impairment charges and gains on disclosed transactions the reader should be aware that the company may recognize similar losses or gains in the future readers should also consider the limitations associated with these nongaap measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another 

the tax impact on our pretax nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of the transactions these tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions 

consolidated results 

the tables below provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted eps which the company views as a key performance metric we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of our nongaap adjustments as management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance the measures presented are based on continuing operations 



 the table below provides a reconciliation of adjusted diluted eps to gaap diluted eps for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 



adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income less income loss from discontinued operations net of tax and excluding certain non‑gaap adjustments which the company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends before interest expense other non‑operating income expense net income tax provision and depreciation and amortization expense adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance margin is calculated for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period 

below is a presentation of consolidated sales and a reconciliation of net income on a gaap basis to adjusted ebitda and net income margin on a gaap basis to adjusted ebitda margin 







below is reconciliation of operating income and operating margin by segment to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin by segment 



 

 

income taxes 

the tax impact of our pretax nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense associated with each adjustment and is primarily dependent upon the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions for additional discussion on the impact of the us tax cuts and jobs act  refer to note 23  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 



liquidity and capital resources 

we maintained a strong financial position throughout fiscal year 2019  as of 30 september 2019  our consolidated balance sheet included cash and cash items of 22487  we continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets and cash flows from operating and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 

as of 30 september 2019  we had 9715 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of 22487  as a result of the tax act we do not expect that a significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates earnings will be subject to us income tax upon subsequent repatriation to the united states the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside however because we have significant current investment plans outside the us it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the us refer to note 23  income taxes  for additional information 

the table below summarizes our cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities from continuing operations as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows

for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2018 cash provided by operating activities was 25472 including income from continuing operations of 14556  other adjustments of 1316 include a 549 net impact from the remeasurement of intercompany transactions the related hedging instruments that eliminate the earnings impact are included as a working capital adjustment in other receivables or payables and accrued liabilities in addition other adjustments were impacted by cash received from the early termination of a cross currency swap of 544 as well as the excess of pension expense over pension contributions of 235 the working capital accounts were a use of cash of 2654 primarily driven by payables and accrued liabilities inventories and trade receivables partially offset by other receivables the use of cash in payables and accrued liabilities of 2777 includes a decrease in customer advances of 1457 primarily related to sale of equipment activity and 671 for maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures the use of cash in inventories primarily resulted from the purchase of helium molecules in addition inventories reflect the noncash impact of our change in accounting for us inventories from lifo to fifo the source of cash from other receivables of 1283 was primarily due to the maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures 

investing activities 

for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2019  cash used for investing activities was 21134  payments for additions to plant and equipment totaled 19897  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was  1232  refer to note 7  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for further details proceeds from investments of  1905 resulting from maturities of shortterm instruments with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year exceeded purchase of 1721

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures is a nongaap measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment acquisitions less cash acquired and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates a reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below 



the components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below 



capital expenditures in fiscal year 2019 totaled 21286 compared to 19138 in fiscal year 2018  the increase of 2148 was primarily due to major project spending including payment for gasification and syngas clean up assets from luan additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine ongoing nature including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements 

2020 outlook for investing activities 

capital expenditures in fiscal year 2020 are expected to be approximately 4 billion to 45 billion which primarily includes our initial expected equity affiliate investment in the jazan gas and power project as well as new plants that are currently under construction or expected to start construction it is not possible without unreasonable efforts to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions these decisions either individually or in the aggregate could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities 

we anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations in addition we intend to continue to evaluate 1 acquisitions of small and mediumsized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies 2 purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create longterm contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee and 3 investment in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy cleaner energy and emerging market growth 

financing activities 

for the fiscal year ended 2019  cash used for financing activities was 13705  this use of cash was largely attributable to dividend payments to shareholders of 9940 and payments on longterm debt of 4286 payments on longterm debt primarily related to the repayment of a 4375 us senior note of 4000 that matured on 21 august 2019

capital needs in fiscal year 2019 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations at the end of 2019  total debt outstanding was 33260 compared to 38126 at the end of 2018  and cash and cash items were 22487 compared to 27913 at the end of 2018  total debt as of 30 september 2019 includes related party debt 3579 associated with the luan joint venture 

on 31 march 2017  we entered into a five year 25000 revolving credit agreement maturing 31 march 2022 with a syndicate of banks the “2017 credit agreement” under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries on 28 september 2018 we amended the 2017 credit agreement to reduce the maximum borrowing capacity to 23000  no other terms were impacted by the amendment 

the 2017 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity for the company and supports its commercial paper program the company’s only financial covenant under the 2017 credit agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization total debt plus total equity no greater than 70  total debt at 30 september 2019 and 2018 expressed as a percentage of total capitalization was 226 and 254  respectively no borrowings were outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement as of 30 september 2019  

as of 30 september 2019 we classified our 2000 eurobond of €300 million 3270 maturing in august 2020 as longterm debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under the 2017 credit agreement our current intent is to refinance this debt via the us or european public or private placement markets 

commitments totaling 23 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries all of which was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2019  

as of 30 september 2019  we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 

on 15 september 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 of our outstanding common stock we did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2019 or 2018  as of 30 september 2019  4853 in share repurchase authorization remains 

dividends 

dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter during 2019  the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from 110 per share to 116 per share or 464 per share annually 

on 26 november 2019 the board of directors declared the first quarter 2020 dividend of 116 per share the dividend is payable on 10 february 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 2 january 2020 

contractual obligations 

we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations the following table summarizes our obligations on a continuing operations basis as of 30 september 2019  



debt obligations 

our debt obligations include the maturity payments of the principal amount of longterm debt including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties and the related contractual interest obligations refer to note 16  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debt obligations 

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest we had approximately 635 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2019  excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2019  variable interest rates are primarily determined by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates and by interbank offer rates 

leases 

refer to note 13  leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities for our us and international pension plans for additional information refer to note 17  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits may be impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

unconditional purchase obligations 

approximately 7100 of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium purchases the majority of these obligations occur after fiscal year 2024 helium purchases include crude feedstock supply to helium refining plants in north america as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world as a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector these helium sourcing agreements are medium to longterm and contain takeiftendered provisions the refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas primarily under mediumterm requirements contracts while contract terms in our helium sourcing contracts are generally longer than our customer sales contracts helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties 

approximately 160 of our longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations which are primarily passthrough contracts with our customers 

we estimate our maximum obligation for future purchases of plant and equipment to be approximately 890 based on open purchase orders as of 30 september 2019 this includes spending for the jiutai coaltosyngas project although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to reschedule cancel or otherwise modify based on our business needs we have disclosed this obligation in fiscal year 2020 however timing of actual satisfaction of the obligation may vary 

we also purchase materials energy capital equipment supplies and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy which are obtained under requirementstype contracts at market prices 

income tax liabilities 

tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2019 were 2317  these tax liabilities were excluded from the table above as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws tax rates and our operating results in addition there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities however the table above includes our accrued liability of approximately 215 for deemed repatriation tax that is payable through 2026 related to the tax act refer to note 23  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate 

on 19 april 2015 a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan saudi arabia we guarantee the repayment of our 25 share of an equity bridge loan to fund equity commitments to the joint venture in total we expect to invest approximately 100 in this joint venture as of 30 september 2019 payables and accrued liabilities included 944 for our obligation to make future equity contributions in 2020 based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan 

expected equity affiliate investment in jazan gas and power project 

on 12 august 2018 air products entered an agreement to form a gasificationpower joint venture jv with saudi aramco and acwa in jazan saudi arabia air products expects to own 51 of the jv with saudi aramco and acwa power owning the balance the jv will purchase the gasification assets power block and the associated utilities from saudi aramco for approximately 115 billion our expected equity affiliate investment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above pending financial closing which is currently expected in fiscal year 2020 

pension benefits 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans are the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan these plans were closed to new participants in 2005 after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2019 measurement date increased to 45048 from 42731 at the end of fiscal year 2018  the projected benefit obligation for these plans was 51456 and 45833 at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively the net unfunded liability increased 3306 from 3102 to 6408  primarily due to lower discount rates partially offset by favorable asset experience refer to note 17  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

pension expense 



pension expense decreased from the prior year due to lower pension settlements lower loss amortization primarily from favorable asset experience and the impact of higher discount rates partially offset by lower expected returns on assets special items settlements termination benefits and curtailments decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses in fiscal year 2019 special items of 72 included pension settlement losses of 64  of which 50 was recorded during the second quarter and related to the us supplementary pension plan and 8 of termination benefits these amounts are reflected within other nonoperating income expense net on the consolidated income statements in fiscal year 2018 special items of 489 included a pension settlement loss of 437 primarily in connection with the transfer of certain pension assets and payment obligations for our us salaried and hourly plans to an insurer during the fourth quarter 48 of pension settlement losses related to lump sum payouts from the us supplementary pension plan and 4 of termination benefits 

uk lloyds equalization ruling 

on 26 october 2018 the united kingdom high court issued a ruling related to the equalization of pension plan participants’ benefits for the gender effects of guaranteed minimum pensions as a result of this ruling we estimated the impact of retroactively increasing benefits in our uk plan in accordance with the high court ruling we treated the additional benefits as a prior service cost which resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss of 47   during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 we are amortizing this cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the uk participants 

2020 outlook 

in fiscal year 2020  we expect pension expense to be approximately 5 to 20  which includes expected pension settlement losses of 5 to 10  depending on the timing of retirements the expected range reflects lower expected interest cost and higher total assets partially offset by higher expected loss amortization primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates in fiscal year 2020 we expect pension expense to include approximately 105 for amortization of actuarial losses 

in fiscal year 2019  pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of 762  net actuarial losses of 4244 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2019  actuarial gains losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains losses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2020  

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of thirdparty actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2019 and 2018  our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 402 and 683  respectively 

for fiscal year 2020  cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 30 to 40  the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans which are dependent upon the timing of retirements actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 37 for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the cercla rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 18  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 142 and 128 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards refer to note 18  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine we estimate that we spent 5 and 3  in fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately 5 in both fiscal years 2020 and 2021  

we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 68 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 82 as of 30 september 2019  the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2019 and 2018 included an accrual of 689 and 768  respectively primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities the accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the pace florida piedmont south carolina and pasadena texas locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses refer to note 18  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs including carbon dioxide these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading system the california cap and trade scheme china’s emission trading scheme and its nationwide expansion and south korea’s emission trading scheme in canada alberta and ontario are both in the developmentapproval process for new ghg regulations alberta’s carbon competitiveness incentive regulation will end december 31 2019 and will be replaced by the proposed technology innovation and emission reduction tier system or environment  climate change canadas output based pricing system obps in lieu of adherence to the obps ontario seeks approval from environment  climate change canada to implement their proposed ghg emissions performance standards program in addition the us environmental protection agency epa requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we also have developed a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from steam methane reforming enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal could increase demand for oxygen one of our main products and our proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 18  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in addition we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

we have related party sales to some of our equity affiliates and joint venture partners as well as other income primarily from fees charged for use of air products patents and technology sales to and other income from related parties totaled approximately 410 and 360 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively sales agreements with related parties include terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party 

in addition we completed the formation of air products lu an changzhi co ltd a 60owned jv with luan clean energy company luan and the jv acquired gasification and syngas cleanup assets from luan during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 refer to note 7  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on outstanding liabilities associated with the acquisition 

inflation 

we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2019 totaled 103376  and depreciation expense totaled 10497 during fiscal year 2019  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

the regional industrial gases segments have numerous longterm customer supply contracts for which we construct an onsite plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years  depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset 

our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and for smaller customers packaged gases the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are 

generally 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc 

in addition we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on our historical experience with similar assets management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

impairment of assets – plant and equipment 

plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign governmentimposed restrictions or expropriations plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the longlived asset a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows 

the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

in fiscal year 2019 there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset groupings may not be recoverable however one of our customers was subject to a government enforced shutdown due to environmental reasons as a result we recognized a charge of 290 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 primarily related to the writeoff of related onsite assets refer to note 24 supplemental information  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

impairment of assets – goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity goodwill was 7971 as of 30 september 2019  disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 11  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 

we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly we have five business segments that are comprised of ten reporting units within seven operating segments refer to note 26  business segment and geographic information  for additional information reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a quantitative test is required we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we initially use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of estimated future cash flows our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capitalintensive nature the longterm contractual nature of our business and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates operating profit andor adjusted ebitda margins discount rate and exit multiple projected revenue growth rates and operating profit andor adjusted ebitda assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan andor revised forecasts and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate reflects expected longterm growth rates 

if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment when the market approach is utilized fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies andor regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects when both the income and market approach are utilized we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019  we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except lasa which is further discussed below substantially all of the remaining goodwill balance related to reporting units in which the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 100 

the fair value of lasa exceeded its carrying value by 11 revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value we determined that with other assumptions held constant a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 310 basis points or a decrease in adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 300 basis points would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being equal to its carrying value as of 30 september 2019 the carrying value of lasa goodwill was 598 or less than 1 of consolidated total assets the carrying value of lasas other material assets at 30 september 2019 included plant and equipment net of 3392 customer relationships of 1290 and trade names and trademarks of 413 the trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets 

future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include but are not limited to longterm economic weakness decline in market share pricing pressures inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures increases to our cost of capital and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses negative changes in one or more of these factors among others could result in impairment charges 

impairment of assets – intangible assets 

intangible assets net with determinable lives at 30 september 2019 totaled 3754 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2019 totaled 441 and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss to determine fair value we utilize the royalty savings method a form of the income approach this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset 

disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in note 12  intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangibles which resulted in no impairment 

impairment of assets – equity method investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 12762 at 30 september 2019  the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 9  summarized financial information of equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

an impairment loss is recognized in the event that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value of an investment occurs management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach andor market approach we utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach for the market approach we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

in fiscal year 2019 there was no need to test for impairment on any of our equity affiliate investments as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition – cost incurred input method 

revenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use we use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations costs incurred include material labor and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer 

accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance schedule and technical issues labor productivity the complexity of work performed the cost and availability of materials and performance of subcontractors when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inceptiontodate effect of such change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities our jazan large air separation unit sale of equipment project within our industrial gases – global segment requires monitoring of risks associated with schedule geography and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract 

changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method including the jazan project favorably impacted operating income by approximately 37 and 38 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years 

we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

revenue recognition – onsite customer contracts 

for customers who require large volumes of gases on a longterm basis we produce and supply gases under longterm contracts from large facilities that we build own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities certain of these onsite contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements minimum payment requirements variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled at 30 september 2019  accrued income taxes including the amount recorded in noncurrent was 3020 and net deferred tax liabilities was 6786  tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2019 were 2317  excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2019 was 4801 and includes a discrete net income tax expense of 438 related to the tax act disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 23  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 increasedecrease in our effective tax rate would decreaseincrease net income by approximately 23  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 17  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the us and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates mortality rates are based on the most recent us and international mortality tables we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans the company measures the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows the rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date these rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 18 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the longterm average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations in determining estimated asset class returns we take into account historical and future expected longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 20 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets for equities this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur and reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for nonequity investments equals the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 8 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the company we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and details are provided in note 18  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased a different remediation alternative is identified or our proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into 

transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1  major accounting policies  and note 14  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current and related party portions interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 15  fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements at 30 september 2019 and 2018  the net financial instrument position was a liability of 32391 and 37362 respectively the decrease in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to the repayment of longterm debt 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2019 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 74 fixedrate debt and 26 variablerate debt our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2018 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 66 fixedrate debt and 34 variablerate debt the decrease in variablerate debt was the result of the repayment and maturity of the 4375 senior note and related fixedtovariable interest rate swaps 

the sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2019  with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 75 and 96 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2019 and 2018  respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 80 and 101 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2019 and 2018  respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 8 and 13 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2019 and 2018 respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 8 and 13 per year at 30 september 2019 and 2018 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2019 and 2018  with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 326 and 329 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2019 and 2018  respectively 

the primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the euro and us dollar and chinese renminbi and us dollar foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

the majority of the company’s sales are derived from outside of the united states and denominated in foreign currencies financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the chinese renminbi and the euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings we estimate that a 10 reduction in either the chinese renminbi or the euro versus the us dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 40 and 25 respectively

 item 1 business 

air products and chemicals inc a delaware corporation originally founded in 1940 serves customers globally with a unique portfolio of products services and solutions that include atmospheric gases process and specialty gases equipment and services the company is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and has built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and natural gas liquefaction as used in this report unless the context indicates otherwise the terms “we” “our” “us” the “company” or “registrant” include controlled subsidiaries affiliates and predecessors of air products and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates 

during its fiscal year ended 30 september 2018 “fiscal year 2018 ” the company reported its continuing operations in five reporting segments under which it managed its operations assessed performance and reported earnings industrial gases – americas industrial gases – emea europe middle east and africa industrial gases – asia industrial gases – global and corporate and other 

except as otherwise noted the description of the companys business below reflects the companys continuing operations refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 25  business segment and geographic information  and note 3  discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments and our discontinued operations 

industrial gases business 

the company’s industrial gases business produces atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gases process gases hydrogen helium carbon dioxide carbon monoxide syngas and specialty gases and equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent process gases are produced by methods other than air separation for example hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas are produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons hydrogen is also produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries and helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs primarily natural gas but also carbon dioxide purified before resale 

the company’s industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally the regional industrial gases segments americas emea and asia supply gases and related equipment in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in refining chemical gasification metals electronics manufacturing and food and beverage hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels the chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals the energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the gasification steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen for inerting is used in various fields including the metals chemical and semiconductor industries helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance 

we distribute gases to our customers through a variety of supply modes 

liquid bulk— product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed typically by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases— small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states the company’s packaged gas business sells products principally helium only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries 

onsite gases— large quantities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are provided to customers principally the energy production and refining chemical gasification and metals industries worldwide that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by 15 to 20 year contracts the company also delivers small quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically either via a 10 to 15 year sale of gas contract or through the sale of the equipment to the customer 

electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas we mitigate electricity natural gas and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough and tolling arrangements during fiscal year 2018  no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas 

the company obtains helium from a number of sources globally including crude helium for purification from the us bureau of land managements helium reserve 

the regional industrial gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method the largest of these joint ventures operate in mexico italy south africa india saudi arabia and thailand 

each of the regional industrial gases segments competes against two global industrial gas companies air liquide sa and linde plc the successor to praxair inc and linde ag pursuant to a combination that became effective on 31 october 2018 as well as regional competitors competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications in locations where we have pipeline networks which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers we derive a competitive advantage

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations are affected by various risks many of which are beyond our control in evaluating investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should consider the following risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

changes in global and regional economic conditions the markets we serve or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues operating results and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings in addition reduced demand could depress sales reduce our margins constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to the company resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or inability to recover plant investments any of which may negatively impact our financial results 

weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or default or other inabilities to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming onstream these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political security legal and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability 

in fiscal year 2018 over 60 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states and many of our operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations import and trade restrictions trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions strained relations between countries or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states particularly in highergrowth markets and involve larger and more complex projects including worldscale gasification projects in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions including russia the middle east and china we are actively investing significant capital and other resources in some cases through joint ventures in developing or high growth markets which present special risks our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including political and economic instability project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and talent risks our contracts in these locations may be subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time 

because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates we choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 

operational and project execution risks may adversely affect our operations or financial results 

some of our projects including some of our largest growth projects involve challenging engineering procurement and construction phases that may occur in more risky locations and over extended time periods sometimes up to several years we may encounter difficulties in engineering delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party equipment and materials delivery delays schedule changes customer scope changes delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rightsofway inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants weatherrelated delays delays by customers contractors in completing their portion of a project technical or transportation difficulties and other factors some of which are beyond our control but which may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule in some cases delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to cancel a project andor compensate the customer for the delay we may not be able to recover any of these costs these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts in the future and these risks are more significant as we take on larger and more complex projects including gasification projects as part of our growth strategy 

the operation of our facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows in addition our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements which depend in part on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets 

we are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to government regulation in the united states and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business the application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability if there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional capital expenditures export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred in addition we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities 

further we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents business partners or businesses that we acquire that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire 

we may be unable to successfully identify execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or effectively disentangle divested businesses 

our ability to grow revenue earnings and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices and realize expected growth synergies and operating efficiencies we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance in addition we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts distract management and give rise to disputes with buyers in addition we have agreed and may in the future agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnities 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach in addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability 

as with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase to date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our accounting for transactions each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements 

our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information we also from time to time export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of our business because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results 

our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics supplier operating or transportation issues or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers 

we typically contract to passthrough cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on our results we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers having a negative impact on our business financial results and cash flows 

our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact our suppliers or customers which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results 

new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

we are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation large scale gasification projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations 

legislative regulatory and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk 

we are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen the primary use of which is the production of ultralow sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health to make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers we use steam methane reforming which releases carbon dioxide some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg including carbon dioxide these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading system the california cap and trade schemes alberta’s carbon competitiveness incentive regulation china’s emission trading scheme south korea’s emission trading scheme nationwide expansion of the china emission trading scheme revisions to the alberta regulation and environment canadas developing output based pricing system in addition the us environmental protection agency epa requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and hydrogen production we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material while we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 

costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see item 1  business environmental controls above 

implementation of the united kingdom’s “uk” exit from european union “eu” membership could adversely affect our european operations 

the uk’s exit from eu membership may adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu members and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business 

inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

we face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of our business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of our products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share 

a change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in december 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which significantly revised the us federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on unremitted cumulative nonus earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax act we recorded a discrete net tax expense of 1806 for fiscal 2018 including a reduction in the deemed repatriation tax related to the taxation of deemed foreign dividends that may be eliminated by future legislation various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue further changes in tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff of versum qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from versum and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the spinoff is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including contract product liability intellectual property insurance and regulatory matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if compensatory andor punitive damages are awarded however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

the company is a party to proceedings under cercla the rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are 32 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under item 1 business environmental controls 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 44 million at 30 september 2018  on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts on 6 may 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against air products brasil ltda was dismissed cade has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

other than this matter we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

effective tax rate 

the effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes refer to note 22  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate 

2018 vs 2017 

the effective tax rate was 260 and 184 in fiscal years 2018 and 2017  respectively the current year rate was higher primarily due to the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act the tax act in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 which significantly changed existing us tax laws including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 that became effective 1 january 2018 a deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings as well as other changes as a result of the tax act our income tax provision for fiscal year 2018 reflects a discrete net income tax expense of 1806  this included a deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and adjustments to the future cost of repatriation from foreign investments of 4486  partially offset by a benefit of 562 related to the us taxation of deemed foreign dividends under the tax act this benefit may be eliminated by future legislation fiscal year 2018 tax expense also includes a benefit of 2118  primarily from the remeasurement of our net us deferred tax liabilities at the lower corporate tax rate in fiscal year 2018 we also recorded a tax benefit of 357 from the restructuring of foreign subsidiaries 

the income tax provision in fiscal year 2017 included a net income tax benefit of 1114 resulting from a tax election related to a nonus subsidiary the effective tax rate in the prior year was also impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of 1453 in our latin america reporting unit and an impairment of 795 of an equity method investment for which no tax benefits were available 

on a nongaap basis the adjusted effective tax rate decreased from 232 in fiscal year 2017 to 186 in fiscal year 2018  we estimate that the lower us federal statutory rate and other impacts of the tax act reduced our fiscal year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate by approximately 35 the current year rate was also lower due to a benefit of 91 related to a final foreign tax audit settlement 

we are reporting the impacts of the tax act provisionally based upon reasonable estimates as of 30 september 2018  the impacts are not yet finalized as they are dependent on factors and analysis not yet known or fully completed including but not limited to further book to us tax adjustments for the earnings of foreign entities the issuance of additional guidance as well as our ongoing analysis of the tax act 

as a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the tax act became effective in our fiscal year 2018 while other provisions do not become effective until fiscal year 2019 the corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of 1 january 2018 and accordingly reduces our 2018 fiscal year us federal statutory rate to a blended rate of approximately 245 

2017 vs 2016 

the effective tax rate was 184 and 278 in fiscal years 2017 and 2016  respectively the 2017 rate included an impact of approximately 700 bp from a net income tax benefit resulting from a tax election related to a nonus subsidiary and an impact of approximately 100 bp from excess tax benefits on sharebased compensation resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 these impacts were partially offset by an increase of approximately 200 bp due to both a goodwill impairment charge in our latin america reporting unit and an impairment of an equity method investment for which no tax benefits were available the 2016 rate included a 330 bp impact from tax costs associated with business separation primarily resulting from a dividend declared in 2016 to repatriate cash from a foreign subsidiary as discussed above under business separation costs the remaining change was primarily due to the impact of business separation costs for which a tax benefit was estimated to not be available on a nongaap basis the adjusted effective tax rate decreased from 242 in fiscal year 2016 to 232 in fiscal year 2017  primarily due to excess tax benefits on sharebased compensation 

discontinued operations 

in fiscal year 2018 income from discontinued operations net of tax of 422 includes an income tax benefit of 256 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions taken in conjunction with the disposition of our former european homecare business in fiscal year 2012 in addition we recorded an aftertax benefit of 176 resulting from the resolution of certain postclosing adjustments associated with the sale of pmd refer to note 22  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information these benefits were partially offset by an aftertax loss of 10 related to efw project exit activities which were completed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

in fiscal year 2017 income from discontinued operations net of tax of 18660 includes a gain of 2870  1828 aftertax or 832 per share for the sale of pmd to evonik the sale closed on 3 january 2017 for 38 billion in cash in addition we recorded a loss on the disposal of efw of 593   471 aftertax during the first quarter of 2017 primarily for land lease obligations and to update our estimate of the net realizable value of the plant assets 

in fiscal year 2016 the loss from discontinued operations net of tax of 4605 includes a loss of 9457  8466 aftertax from the write down of efw plant assets to their estimated net realizable value and a liability recorded for plant disposition and other costs this loss was partially offset by the results of pmd and emd

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated except for per share data 

the company has presented certain financial measures on a nongaap “adjusted” basis and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap these financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap the company believes these nongaap measures provide investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results 

in many cases our nongaap measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to exclude certain disclosed items “nongaap adjustments” that we believe are not representative of the underlying business performance for example in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 we restructured the company to focus on its core industrial gases business this resulted in significant cost reduction and asset actions that we believe were important for investors to understand separately from the performance of the underlying business additionally in fiscal year 2018 we recorded discrete impacts associated with the tax act  the reader should be aware that we may incur similar expenses in the future 

the tax impact on our pretax nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions investors should also consider the limitations associated with these nongaap measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 we adopted accounting guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2018 presentation refer to note 2  new accounting guidance  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

presented below are reconciliations of the reported gaap results to the nongaap measures

income taxes 

the tax impact of our pretax nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions for additional discussion on the fiscal year 2018 nongaap tax adjustments including the impact of the us tax cuts and jobs act  refer to note 22  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements

as of 30 september 2018  we had 9951 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of 27913  as a result of the tax act we currently do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to us income tax upon subsequent repatriation to the united states depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes however since we have significant current investment plans outside the us it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the us refer to note 22  income taxes for additional information

for the year ended 2017 cash used for financing activities was 20409 this consisted primarily of repayments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings of 7986 dividend payments to shareholders of 7879 and payments on longterm debt of 4839 payments on longterm debt primarily consisted of the repayment of a 4625 eurobond of €300 million 3172 that matured on 15 march 2017 and 1380 for the repayment of industrial revenue bonds 

for the year ended 2016 cash used for financing activities was 8602 our borrowings short and longterm proceeds net of repayments were a net use of cash of 2377 and included the repayment of the 20 senior note of 3500 million on 2 august 2016 and a 1442 use of cash for net commercial paper and other shortterm debt borrowings which were partially offset by debt proceeds from the issuance of a 375 eurobond of €350 million 3869 on 1 june 2016 versum distributed inkind notes with an aggregate principal amount of 4250 to air products however since air products exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for 4183 of air products’ outstanding commercial paper this noncash debt for debt exchange was excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows refer to note 4 materials technologies separation to the consolidated financial statements for additional details we also used cash to pay dividends of 7212 and received proceeds from stock option exercises of 1413 

discontinued operations 

for the year ended 2018 cash flows of discontinued operations were not material 

for the year ended 2017 cash flows of discontinued operations primarily included impacts associated with the spinoff of emd as versum on 1 october 2016 and the sale of pmd to evonik on 3 january 2017 cash used for operating activities of 9662 was primarily driven by taxes paid on the gain on the sale of pmd cash provided by investing activities of 37506 primarily resulted from the proceeds on the sale of pmd cash provided by financing activities resulted from a 695 receipt of cash from versum related to finalization of the spinoff 

for the year ended 2016 discontinued operations primarily includes the energyfromwaste business which the company decided to exit in the second quarter of 2016 and the materials technologies business which contained two divisions emd and pmd cash provided by discontinued operations was 7536 primarily driven by income from operations of discontinued operations which excludes the noncash impairment charge of 3861 and longterm debt proceeds from versums term loan b of 5750 partially offset by capital expenditures for plant and equipment of 2451 refer to note 3 discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financing and capital structure 

capital needs in fiscal year 2018 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations at the end of 2018  total debt outstanding was 38126 compared to 39628 at the end of 2017  and cash and cash items were 27913 compared to 32736 at the end of 2017  total debt as of 30 september 2018 includes related party debt of 26 billion rmb  384  associated with the luan joint venture 

on 31 march 2017  we entered into a five year 25000 revolving credit agreement maturing 31 march 2022 with a syndicate of banks the “2017 credit agreement” under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries on 28 september 2018 we amended the 2017 credit agreement to reduce the maximum borrowing capacity to 23000  no other terms were impacted by the amendment 

the 2017 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity for the company and supports its commercial paper program the company’s only financial covenant under the 2017 credit agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization total debt plus total equity no greater than 70  total debt at 30 september 2018 and 2017 expressed as a percentage of total capitalization was 254 and 280  respectively no borrowings were outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement as of 30 september 2018  

commitments totaling 70 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries all of which was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2018  

as of 30 september 2018  we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 

on 15 september 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 of our outstanding common stock we did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2018  2017 or 2016  at 30 september 2018 4853 in share repurchase authorization remains 

2019 outlook 

cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future and our working capital balance was 27439 at 30 september 2018  we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants 

dividends 

dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter during 2018  the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from 95 per share to 110 per share or 440 per share annually 

contractual obligations 

we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations the following table summarizes our obligations on a continuing operations basis as of 30 september 2018  



debt obligations 

our debt obligations include the maturity payments of the principal amount of longterm debt including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties and the related contractual interest obligations refer to note 15  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debt obligations 

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest we had approximately 640 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2018  excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2018  variable interest rates are primarily determined by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates and by interbank offer rates 

leases 

refer to note 12  leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities for our us and international pension plans for additional information refer to note 16  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits may be impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

unconditional purchase obligations 

approximately 6800 of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium purchases the majority of these obligations occur after fiscal year 2023 helium purchases include crude feedstock supply to multiple helium refining plants in north america as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world as a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector these helium sourcing agreements are medium to longterm and contain takeiftendered provisions the refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas primarily under mediumterm requirements contracts while contract terms in the energy sector are longer than those in merchant helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties 

approximately 210 of our longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations which are primarily passthrough contracts with our customers 

purchase commitments to spend approximately 455 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2019  

we also purchase materials energy capital equipment supplies and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy which are obtained under requirementstype contracts at market prices 

income tax liabilities 

tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2018 were 2336  these tax liabilities were excluded from the contractual obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws tax rates and our operating results in addition there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities however the contractual obligations table above includes our accrued liability of approximately 184 for deemed repatriation tax that is payable over eight years related to the tax act refer to note 22  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate 

on 19 april 2015 a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan saudi arabia air products owns 25 of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan in total we expect to invest approximately 100 in this joint venture as of 30 september 2018  we recorded a noncurrent liability of 944 for our obligation to make future equity contributions in 2020 based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan 

expected investment in joint venture 

on 12 august 2018 air products entered an agreement to form a gasificationpower joint venture jv with saudi aramco and acwa in jazan saudi arabia air products will own at least 55 of the jv with saudi aramco and acwa power owning the balance the jv will purchase the gasification assets power block and the associated utilities from saudi aramco for approximately 8 billion our expected investment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above pending closing which is currently expected in fiscal year 2020 

the jv will own and operate the facility under a 25year contract for a fixed monthly fee saudi aramco will supply feedstock to the jv and the jv will produce power hydrogen and other utilities for saudi aramco 

pension benefits 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans are the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan these plans were closed to new participants in 2005 after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2018 measurement date decreased to 42731 from 44092 at the end of fiscal year 2017  the projected benefit obligation for these plans was 45833 and 51072 at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017  respectively the net unfunded liability decreased 3878 from 6980 to 3102  primarily due to higher discount rates and favorable asset experience refer to note 16  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

pension expense 



2018 vs 2017 

pension expense excluding settlements termination benefits and curtailments special items decreased from the prior year primarily due to recognition of favorable asset experience partially offset by lower expected returns on assets in fiscal year 2018 special items of 489 included a pension settlement loss of 437 primarily resulting from the transfer of certain us pension payment obligations to an insurer during the fourth quarter 48 of pension settlement losses related to lump sum payouts from the us supplemental pension plan and 4 of termination benefits all of which are reflected in other nonoperating income expense net on the consolidated income statements 

2017 vs 2016 

pension expense excluding special items increased from fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate offset by favorable asset experience special items of 150 included pension settlement losses of 105 related to the us supplementary pension plan as well as curtailment and termination benefits of 45 

2019 outlook 

in fiscal year 2019  pension expense excluding special items is expected to be approximately 20 to 30 this results from lower loss amortization primarily due to favorable asset experience and the impact of higher discount rates partially offset by lower expected returns on assets pension settlement losses of 10 to 15 are expected depending on the timing of retirements in fiscal year 2019 we expect pension expense to include approximately 75 for amortization of actuarial losses in fiscal year 2018  pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of 128 net actuarial gains of 232 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2018  actuarial gainslosses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gainslosses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2019  

subsequent event – gmp equalization 

on 26 october 2018 the united kingdom high court issued a ruling in a case relating to equalization of pension plan participants’ benefits for the gender effects of guaranteed minimum pensions gmp equalization the ruling relates to the lloyds banking group pension plans but impacts other uk defined benefit pension plans we are still assessing the impact of this ruling if we determine that the ruling impacts our uk pension plan the approach to achieve gmp equalization may retroactively increase our benefit obligation for some participants in the plan and may impact funding requirements 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of third party actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2018 and 2017  our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 683 and 641 respectively 

for fiscal year 2019  cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 45 to 65 the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans which are dependent upon the timing of retirements actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on pages 4344 for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 128  114  and 122 in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards refer to note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine we estimate that we spent 3  7  and 3 in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately 4 in both fiscal years 2019 and 2020  

we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 76 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 90 as of 30 september 2018  the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2018 and 2017 included an accrual of 768 and 836  respectively primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities the accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the pace florida piedmont south carolina and pasadena texas locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses refer to note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg including carbon dioxide these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading system the california cap and trade schemes alberta’s carbon competitiveness incentive regulation china’s emission trading scheme south korea’s emission trading scheme nationwide expansion of the china emission trading scheme revisions to the alberta regulation and environment canadas developing output based pricing system in addition the us environmental protection agency epa requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and hydrogen production we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we also have developed a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from steam methane reforming enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal could increase demand for oxygen one of our main products and our proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in addition we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

we have related party sales to some of our equity affiliates and joint venture partners sales to related parties totaled approximately 340  580  and 320 during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively and primarily related to jazan sale of equipment activity agreements with related parties include terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party 

in addition we completed the formation of air products lu an changzhi co ltd a 60owned jv with luan clean energy company luan and the jv acquired gasification and syngas cleanup assets from luan during the third quarter of 2018 in connection with the acquisition luan made a loan of 26 billion rmb to the jv and we established a liability of 23 billion rmb for cash payments expected to be made to or on behalf of luan in fiscal year 2019 as of 30 september 2018 longterm debt payable to luan of 26 billion rmb  384  is presented on the consolidated balance sheets as  longterm debt – related party  and our expected remaining cash payments of approximately 22 billion rmb  330  are presented within payables and accrued liabilities 

inflation 

we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2018 totaled 99237  and depreciation expense totaled 9407 during fiscal year 2018  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

the regional industrial gases segments have numerous longterm customer supply contracts for which we construct an onsite plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset 

our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and for smaller customers packaged gases the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are 

generally 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc 

in addition we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on our historical experience with similar assets management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional industrial gases segments would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 



impairment of assets 

plant and equipment 

plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the longlived asset a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows 

the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

in fiscal year 2018 there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset groupings may not be recoverable 

in fiscal year 2017 we performed interim impairment testing of our latin america reporting unit lasa longlived assets and indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill as of 30 june 2017 see the 2017 impairment testing discussions under the goodwill and intangible assets sections below  we also tested the recoverability of lasas longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets subject to amortization and concluded that they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows 

in fiscal year 2016 the board of directors approved the company’s exit of its efw business we assessed the recoverability of capital costs for the two projects associated with this business and recorded an impairment charge of 9135 to reduce the carrying values of plant assets to their estimated net realizable value we estimated the net realizable value of the projects assuming an orderly liquidation of assets capable of being marketed on a secondary equipment market based on market quotes and our experience with selling similar equipment an asset’s orderly liquidation value is the amount that could be realized from a liquidation sale given a reasonable period of time to find a buyer selling the asset in the existing condition where it is located and assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants the loss was measured as the difference between the orderly liquidation value of the assets and the net book value of the assets the loss was recorded in the results of discontinued operations 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we recorded an additional loss of 63 to update our estimate of the net realizable value of the plant assets the loss was recorded in the results of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2017 we also recorded a charge of 457 to writedown the air separation unit in the industrials gases – emea segment that was constructed mainly to provide oxygen to one of the efw plants to its net realizable value of 14  the charge was recorded in the results of continuing operations the remaining assets associated with efw were liquidated during fiscal year 2018 with no value remaining as of 30 september 2018 

refer to note 3  discontinued operations  and note 5  cost reduction and asset actions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity goodwill was 7889 as of 30 september 2018  disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 

we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly we have five business segments that are comprised of ten reporting units within seven operating segments refer to note 25  business segment and geographic information  for additional information reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a quantitative test is required we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we initially use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of estimated future cash flows our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capitalintensive nature the longterm contractual nature of our business and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates operating profit andor ebitda margins discount rate and exit multiple projected revenue growth rates and operating profit andor ebitda assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan andor revised forecasts and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate reflects expected longterm growth rates 

if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment when the market approach is utilized fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies andor regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects when both the income and market approach are utilized we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

2018 impairment testing 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018  we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except lasa for which the fair value exceeded the carrying value by 8 

the excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units other than lasa ranged from approximately 110 to approximately 280 management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of these reporting units in this scenario the fair value of our reporting units other than lasa continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 90 to 240 

as of 30 september 2018 the carrying value of lasa goodwill was 656 or less than 1 of consolidated total assets further events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to a decline in market share pricing pressures and further economic weakening in the markets we serve revenue growth and ebitda margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value of lasa we determined that with other assumptions held constant a decrease in revenue rates of approximately 230 basis points or a decrease in ebitda margin of approximately 210 basis points would result in an impairment of the remaining goodwill balance the carrying value of lasas other material assets at 30 september 2018 included plant and equipment net of 3411 customer relationships of 1521 and trade names and trademarks of 484 the trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets 

future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include but are not limited to longterm economic weakness decline in market share pricing pressures inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures increases to our cost of capital and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses negative changes in one or more of these factors among others could result in impairment charges 

2017 impairment testing 

for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 volumes declined in our lasa reporting unit and overall revenue growth did not meet expectations due to weak economic conditions in latin america and expectations for continued volume weakness in the latin american countries and markets in which we operate we lowered our longterm growth projections for lasa by more than 200 basis points which also unfavorably impacted our ebitda margin management considered the revised projections for lasa to be indicators of potential impairment and accordingly performed interim impairment testing of our longlived assets and indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill as of 30 june 2017 utilizing the revised projections lasa represented approximately 6 of the company’s total revenue in 2017 with business units in chile colombia and other latin america countries 

we estimated the fair value of lasa as of 30 june 2017 based on two valuation approaches the income approach and the market approach as described above we reviewed relevant facts and circumstances in determining the weighting of the approaches under the income approach we estimated the fair value of lasa based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and ebitda margins taking into consideration business and market conditions for the latin american countries and markets in which we operate these estimates were consistent with our revised forecast and longterm financial planning processes which included a reduction in sales growth by more than 200 basis points from that previously identified we calculated the discount rate based on a marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which considers industryspecific rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure adjusted for risks associated with business size and geography under the market approach we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publiclytraded industrial gases companies and regional manufacturing companies adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects 

based on the results of the valuations we determined that the goodwill associated with lasa was impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 1453 the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value during the third quarter of 2017 this impairment is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge” this charge was not deductible for tax purposes and is excluded from segment operating income 

intangible assets 

intangible assets net with determinable lives at 30 september 2018 totaled 3873 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2018 totaled 512 and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss to determine fair value we utilize the royalty savings method a form of the income approach this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset 

disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in note 11  intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 

2018 impairment testing 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangibles which resulted in no impairment 

2017 impairment testing 

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 we conducted an interim impairment test of the indefinitelived intangible assets associated with lasa we determined that the carrying value of trade names and trademarks was in excess of fair value and as a result we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 168 to reduce these indefinitelived intangible assets to their fair value this impairment charge has been excluded from segment operating income and is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 12772 at 30 september 2018  the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8  summarized financial information of equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

an impairment loss is recognized in the event that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value of an investment occurs management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach andor market approach we utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach for the market approach we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 abdullah hashim industrial gases  equipment co ltd ahg a 25 ‑owned equity affiliate in our industrial gases – emea segment completed a review of its business plan and outlook as a result of the revised business plan we determined there was an otherthantemporary impairment of our investment in ahg and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 795 to reduce the carrying value of our investment the impairment charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “equity affiliates income” this charge was not deductible for tax purposes and has been excluded from segment results 

the decline in value resulted from expectations for lower future cash flows to be generated by ahg primarily due to challenging economic conditions in saudi arabia including the impacts of lower prices in the oil and gas industry increased competition and capital project growth opportunities not materializing as anticipated 

the ahg investment was valued based on the results of the income and market valuation approaches the income approach utilized a discount rate based on a marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which considers industry required rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure adjusted for risks associated with size and geography other significant estimates and assumptions that drove our updated valuation of ahg included revenue growth rates and profit margins that were lower than those upon acquisition and our assessment of ahgs business improvement plan effectiveness under the market approach we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publiclytraded industrial gases companies engaged in similar lines of business adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects 

revenue recognition – percentageofcompletion method 

revenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the percentageofcompletion method under this method revenue from the sale of major equipment such as lng heat exchangers and large air separation units is primarily recognized based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs to be incurred we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete the contract and recognize the profit over the life of the contract 

accounting for contracts using the percentageofcompletion method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance schedule and technical issues labor productivity the complexity of work performed the cost and availability of materials and performance of subcontractors when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inceptiontodate effect of such change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities our jazan large air separation unit sale of equipment project within our industrial gases – global segment requires monitoring of risks associated with schedule geography and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract 

changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method including the jazan project favorably impacted operating income by approximately 38  27  and 20 in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years 

we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled at 30 september 2018  accrued income taxes including the amount recorded in noncurrent was 2440 and net deferred tax liabilities was 6537  tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2018 were 2336  excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2018 was 5243 and includes a discrete net income tax expense of 1806 related to the tax act the net expense was recorded based on provisional estimates pursuant to the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 subsequent adjustments if any will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 22  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in our effective tax rate would decreaseincrease net income by approximately 20  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 16  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the us and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates mortality rates are based on the most recent us and international mortality tables we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans the company measures the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows the rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date these rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 32 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated longterm returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets in determining estimated asset class returns we take into account historical and future expected longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 21 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets for equities this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur and reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 11 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the company we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within 

this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and details are provided in note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased a different remediation alternative is identified or our proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into 

transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1  major accounting policies  and note 13  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current and related party portions interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 14 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements at 30 september 2018 and 2017  the net financial instrument position was a liability of 37362 and 38323 respectively 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2018 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 66 fixedrate debt and 34 variablerate debt our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2017 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 65 fixedrate debt and 35 variablerate debt 

the sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2018  with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 96 and 112 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2018 and 2017  respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 101 and 119 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2018 and 2017  respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 13 and 14 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2018 and 2017 respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 13 and 14 per year at 30 september 2018 and 2017 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2018 and 2017  with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 329 and 312 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2018 and 2017  respectively 

the primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the euro and us dollar and chinese renminbi and us dollar foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

the majority of the company’s sales are derived from outside of the united states and denominated in foreign currencies financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the chinese renminbi and the euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings we estimate that a 10 reduction in either the chinese renminbi or the euro versus the us dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 30 and 25 respectively

air products and chemicals inc “we” “our” “us” the “company” “air products” or “registrant” a delaware corporation originally founded in 1940 serves energy electronics chemicals metals and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products services and solutions that include atmospheric gases process and specialty gases equipment and services the company is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and has built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and natural gas liquefaction as used in this report unless the context indicates otherwise the terms “we” “our” “us” the “company” or “registrant” include controlled subsidiaries affiliates and predecessors of air products and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates 

on 1 october 2016 the company completed the spinoff of its former electronic materials business by distributing to air products shareholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding stock of versum materials inc versum the entity air products incorporated to hold this business which established versum as an independent publicly traded corporation on 3 january 2017 air products completed the sale of its performance materials business to evonik industries ag the results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the electronic materials and performance materials businesses are presented herein as discontinued operations on 29 march 2016 the board of directors approved the companys exit of its energyfromwaste efw business and efforts to start up and operate the two efw projects located in tees valley united kingdom were discontinued since that time the efw segment has been presented as a discontinued operation 

during its fiscal year ended 30 september 2017  “fiscal year 2017 ” the company reported its continuing operations in five reporting segments under which it managed its operations assessed performance and reported earnings industrial gases – americas industrial gases – emea europe middle east and africa industrial gases – asia industrial gases – global and corporate and other 

except as otherwise noted the description of the companys business below reflects the companys continuing operations which excludes the electronic materials performance materials and efw businesses refer to note 25  business segment and geographic information  and note 3  discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments and our discontinued operations 

industrial gases business 

the company’s industrial gases business produces atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gases process gases hydrogen helium carbon dioxide carbon monoxide syngas and specialty gases and equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent process gases are produced by methods other than air separation for example hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas or by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries and helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs primarily natural gas but also carbon dioxide purified before resale 

the company’s industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally the regional industrial gases segments americas emea and asia supply gases and related equipment in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in metals glass chemical processing electronics energy production and refining food processing medical and general manufacturing hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels the chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals the energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen for inerting is used in various fields including the metals chemical and semiconductor industries helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance 

we distribute gases to our customers through a variety of supply modes 

liquid bulk— product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed typically by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases— small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states the company’s packaged gas business sells products principally helium only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries 

onsite gases— large quantities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are provided to customers principally the energy production and refining chemical and metals industries worldwide who require large volumes of gases that have relatively constant demand gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by 15 to 20 year contracts the company also delivers small quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically either via a 10 to 15 year sale of gas contract or through the sale of the equipment to the customer 

electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases and natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas production we mitigate electricity and natural gas price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough arrangements during fiscal year 2017  no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas 

the company obtains helium from a number of sources globally including crude helium for purification from the us bureau of land managements helium reserve qatar is a significant supplier of helium globally providing over 25 of the worlds supply during 2017 multiple arab states cut diplomatic ties with and closed their borders to qatar disrupting helium production and transportation for several weeks air products helium business was not materially affected during this initial phase of the embargo due to its diverse sourcing of crude helium but customer demand exceeded supply during this period and supply challenges may recur prior to resolution of the embargo 

the regional industrial gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method the largest of these joint ventures operate in mexico italy south africa india saudi arabia and thailand 

each of the regional industrial gases segments competes against three global industrial gas companies air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc as well as regional competitors competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications in locations where we have pipeline networks which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers we derive a competitive advantage 

overall regional industrial gases sales constituted approximately 90  of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2017  90  in fiscal year 2016  and 92  in fiscal year 2015  sales of tonnage hydrogen and related products constituted approximately 24  of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2017  21  in fiscal year 2016  and 24  in fiscal year 2015  sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 45   of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2017  46  in fiscal year 2016  and 45  in fiscal year 2015

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations are affected by various risks many of which are beyond our control in evaluating investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should consider the following risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

unfavorable conditions in the global economy the markets we serve or the financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues operating results and cash flows 

demand for the company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which the company does business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in markets served by the company have impacted in the past and may impact in the future demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings unfavorable conditions can depress sales affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility impact efficient utilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities can decrease the company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to the company resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or inability to recover plant investments negatively impacting our financial results 

weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or default or other inabilities to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming onstream these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political security legal risks and currency translation that could decrease profitability 

in 2017 over 60 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states and many of our operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states particularly in highgrowth markets our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations import and trade restrictions and trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions strained relations between countries or imposition of international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are actively investing significant capital and other resources in developing markets which present special risks including through joint ventures our developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including political and economic instability project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and talent risks our contractual relationship within these jurisdictions may be subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates we choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 

operational and project execution risks may adversely affect our operations or financial results 

the operation of our facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows in addition our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements which depends in part on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets 

some of our projects involve challenging engineering procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods sometimes up to several years we may encounter difficulties in engineering delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party equipment and materials delivery delays schedule changes delays from customer failure to timely obtain regulatory permits and rightsofway inability to find adequate sources of labor in the geographies where we are building new plants weatherrelated delays delays by subcontractors in completing their portion of the project and other factors some of which are beyond our control but which may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule in some cases delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to cancel a project andor compensate the customer for the delay we may not be able to recover any of these costs these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts 

we are subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which we do business regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conducts our business the application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs in addition we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities 

further we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or our business partners or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or effectively disentangle divested businesses 

our ability to grow revenue earnings and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices and realize expected synergies and operating efficiencies we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack contractual protections or insurance we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have agreed and may in the future agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities our financial results could be impacted by claims under these indemnities 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information or multiple site impact through a security breach in addition these systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers 

as with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase to date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as our information is critical to us the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information we also from time to time export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of our business because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments harming our business and financial results 

our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics supplier operating or transportation issues such as the qatar embargo or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers 

we typically contract to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on our results we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact our revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers having a negative impact on our business financial results and cash flows 

our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact our suppliers or customers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to us or our customers may be unable to purchase or accept our products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results 

new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

we are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputations large scale gasification projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others such technologies or processes may be new to us 

our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material while we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable at law also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 

costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of our products future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see item 1  business environmental controls above 

legislative regulatory and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk 

we are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen the primary use of which is the production of ultralow sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health to make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers we use steam methane reforming which releases carbon dioxide some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg including carbon dioxide these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading scheme california and ontario cap and trade schemes alberta’s specified gas emitters regulation china’s emission trading scheme pilots south korea’s emission trading scheme and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions under an ontario cap and trade scheme nationwide expansion of the china emission trading scheme and revisions to the alberta regulation in addition the us environmental protection agency epa requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs   

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and hydrogen production we believe it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products   

implementation of the united kingdom’s “uk” exit from european union “eu” membership or recent political instability in spain could adversely affect our european operations 

the uk’s exit from eu membership may adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu members and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business 

in addition there has been recent political instability in catalonia spain we maintain an administrative office in catalonia which provides transactional accounting and other support services for our entire european business and fiscal year 2017 sales of approximately us320 million were attributable to spain these operations could be impacted by the outcome of the current unrest 

inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

we face strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of our business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of our products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation for example the united states congress is considering comprehensive tax reform which among other things may significantly reduce the corporate tax rate and change certain us tax rules impacting the way us based multinationals are taxed on foreign income changes to the tax system in the united states particularly a proposed mandatory deemed repatriation tax could have a material impact to our financial statements the cumulative undistributed earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures on the consolidated balance sheets amounted to 60325 as of 30 september 2017 the potential impact of the mandatory deemed repatriation proposal and other proposals is uncertain at this time especially as the outcome of us tax reform discussions is unknown at this time we are properly reflecting the provision for taxes on income using all current enacted global tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate 

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff of versum qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from versum and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the spinoff is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including contract product liability intellectual property insurance and regulatory matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if compensatory andor punitive damages are awarded however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

the company is a party to proceedings under cercla the rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are approximately 32  sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under item 1  business environmental controls 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million  approximately 57  million at 30 september 2017  on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts on 6 may 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against air products brasil ltda was dismissed cade has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

other than this matter we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

2017  in summary 

in 2017  we were able to focus on our core industrial gases business by completing the separation of emd through the spinoff of versum materials inc versum and the sale of pmd to evonik industries ag evonik sales of 82 billion increased nine percent over the prior year primarily due to volume growth from new project onstreams across our regional industrial gases businesses underlying growth in the base business and continued progress on the jazan project within our industrial gases – global segment partially offset by weaker liquefied natural gas lng equipment sales we delivered operating margin of 174  adjusted operating margin of 216  and adjusted ebitda margin of 341  as our productivity actions were offset by the impact of energy cost passthrough to customers diluted eps of 516   increased   2  from the prior year on a nongaap basis adjusted diluted eps of 631   increased   12

changes in diluted earnings per share attributable to air products 





2018  outlook 

in 2018  we intend to build on our strong fiscal year 2017 operating results through a combination of base business growth new project onstreams and productivity benefits we expect lower income from transition services agreements to be offset by cost reductions associated with these services our recent portfolio actions including the spinoff of versum and the sale pmd and improved operating results have positioned us with a strong balance sheet and the opportunity to invest in our core industrial gases business to drive future growth and create shareholder value

sales of 826   decreased   1534  primarily due to lower lng project activity we expect continued weakness in new lng project orders due to continued oversupply of lng in the market operating loss of 1706   increased   830  due to lower lng activity partially offset by productivity improvements and income from transition service agreements with versum and evonik 

2016  vs 2015   

sales of 2360 decreased 794 or 25 primarily due to lower lng sale of equipment activity operating loss of 876 increased 1 or 11 due to lower lng activity mostly offset by benefits from our recent cost reduction actions and lower foreign exchange losses 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated except for per share data 

the company has presented certain financial measures on a nongaap “adjusted” basis and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap these financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap the company believes these nongaap measures provide investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful supplemental information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results 

in many cases our nongaap measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to exclude certain disclosed items “nongaap adjustments” that we believe are not representative of the underlying business performance for example air products has executed its strategic plan to restructure the company to focus on its core industrial gases business this resulted in significant cost reduction and asset actions that we believe are important for investors to understand separately from the performance of the underlying business the reader should be aware that we may incur similar expenses in the future the tax impact of our nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions investors should also consider the limitations associated with these nongaap measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another   

presented below are reconciliations of the reported gaap results to the nongaap measures 

consolidated results 







adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as income from continuing operations including noncontrolling interests excluding certain disclosed items which the company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends before interest expense other nonoperating income expense net income tax provision and depreciation and amortization expense adjusted ebitda provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance

b  reflected on the consolidated income statements in “other income expense net” 

below is a summary of segment operating income 

below is a reconciliation of segment operating income to adjusted ebitda 

a  adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by sales 

income taxes 

the tax impact of our nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions 



liquidity and capital resources 

we maintained a strong financial position throughout 2017 and as of 30 september 2017 our consolidated balance sheet included cash and cash items of 32736  the cash and cash items balance is higher than our historical trend and primarily results from the sale of pmd to evonik on 3 january 2017 we continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets and cash flows from operating and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 

as of 30 september 2017 we had 15302 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of 32736  if the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the us or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes on a significant portion of these amounts however since we have significant current investment plans outside the us it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the us current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities from continuing operations as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized in the following table

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures are detailed in the following table 



 capital expenditures on a gaap basis in 2017  totaled 10560  compared to 9077  in 2016  the increase  of 1483  was primarily due to higher capital expenditures on facility improvement projects and major project spending additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine ongoing nature including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements spending in 2017  and 2016  included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen and nitrogen for coal to liquid fuel in china hydrogen to global markets oxygen to the steel industry and nitrogen for the electronics industry 

capital expenditures on a nongaap basis in 2017  totaled 10659  compared to 9349  in 2016  the increase  of 1310  was primarily due to higher capital expenditures on facility improvement projects and major project spending partially offset by lower capital lease expenditures 

on 19 april 2015 a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan saudi arabia air products owns 25 of the joint venture during 2016  and 2015 we recorded noncash transactions which resulted in an increase of 269  and 675  respectively to our investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates for our obligation to invest in the joint venture these noncash transactions were excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows and there was no impact in 2017 in total we expect to invest approximately 100  in this joint venture air products has also entered into a sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer procure and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply the gases to saudi aramco 

sales backlog represents our estimate of revenue to be recognized in the future on our share of air products’ sale of equipment orders and related process technology that are under firm contracts the sales backlog for the company at 30 september 2017  was 481 compared to 1057 at 30 september 2016  the decrease was primarily driven by progress on the jazan project 

2018  outlook 

capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2018  are expected to be approximately 1000 to 1200 this range excludes possible acquisitions and our previously announced agreement to form a joint venture air products lu’an changzhi co ltd with lu’an clean energy company that will build own and operate four large air separation units as discussed in the contractual obligations section on page 43  a majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants that are currently under construction or expected to start construction it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations in addition we intend to continue to evaluate acquisitions of small and medium size industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies the purchase of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create longterm contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee and investment in very large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy cleaner energy and emerging market growth 

financing activities 

for the year ended 2017  cash used for financing activities was 20409  this consisted primarily of repayments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings of 7986 dividend payments to shareholders of 7879 and payments on longterm debt of 4839 payments on longterm debt primarily consisted of the repayment of a 4625 eurobond of €300 million 3172 that matured on 15 march 2017 and 1380 for the repayment of industrial revenue bonds

financing and capital structure 

capital needs in 2017  were satisfied primarily with cash from operations at the end of 2017  total debt outstanding was 39628  compared to 52109  at the end of 2016  and cash and cash items were 32736  compared to 12932  at the end of 2016  

on 31 march 2017 we entered into a fiveyear 25000 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the “2017 credit agreement” under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries the 2017 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity for the company and supports its commercial paper program the company’s only financial covenant is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization total debt plus total equity no greater than 70 total debt at 30 september 2017  and 2016  expressed as a percentage of total capitalization total debt plus total equity was 280  and 419  respectively no borrowings were outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement as of 30 september 2017 

the 2017 credit agreement terminates and replaces our previous 26900 revolving credit agreement the “2013 credit agreement” which was to mature 30 april 2018 no borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement at the time of its termination and no early termination penalties were incurred 

commitments totaling 234  are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries all of which was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2017  

as of 30 september 2017  we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 

on 15 september 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000  of our outstanding common stock we did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2017  2016  or 2015  at 30 september 2017 4853  in share repurchase authorization remains 

  2018  outlook 

cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future and our working capital balance was 33877  at 30 september 2017  we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants 

on 16 october 2017 we repaid a 12 senior note of 400 that matured on 15 october 2017 as of 30 september 2017 this note was reflected in current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheets 

dividends 

dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter during 2017  the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from 86 per share to 95 per share 

contractual obligations 

we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations the following table summarizes our obligations on a continuing operations basis as of 30 september 2017  



longterm debt obligations 

the longterm debt obligations include the maturity payments of longterm debt including current portion and the related contractual interest obligations refer to note 15  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on longterm debt 

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the longterm debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest we had 655 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2017  excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2017  variable interest rates are primarily determined by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates and by interbank offer rates 

leases 

refer to note 12  leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities less the net pension liability transferred to discontinued operations refer to note 16  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

unconditional purchase obligations 

approximately 5600  of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium purchases which include crude feedstock supply to multiple helium refining plants in north america as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world as a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector these helium sourcing agreements are medium to longterm and contain takeorpay provisions the refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas primarily under mediumterm requirements contracts while contract terms in the energy sector are longer than those in merchant helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties 

approximately 280  of our longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations which are primarily passthrough contracts with our customers 

purchase commitments to spend approximately 300  for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2018  in addition we have purchase commitments totaling approximately 180  in 2018  relating to our longterm sale of equipment project for saudi aramco’s jazan oil refinery 

we also purchase materials energy capital equipment supplies and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy which are obtained under requirementstype contracts at market prices 

obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate 

on 19 april 2015 a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan saudi arabia air products owns 25 of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan in total we expect to invest approximately 100  in this joint venture as of 30 september 2017  and 2016  we recorded a noncurrent liability of 944  for our obligation to make future equity contributions in 2020 based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan 

investment in joint venture 

on 10 september 2017 air products signed an agreement to form a joint venture air products lu’an changzhi co ltd with lu’an clean energy company air products has already invested 300 million to build own and operate four large air separation units to supply the changzhi city site under the agreement air products will contribute the air separation units and invest an additional 500 air products will own 60 of the joint venture and will consolidate its financial results closing will occur upon the completion of initial operational startup and government and regulatory approvals due to the uncertainty of those milestones the additional investment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

income tax liabilities 

noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 september 2017  were 7784  tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2017  were 1464  these tax liabilities were excluded from the contractual obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws tax rates and our operating results in addition there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities refer to note 22  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pension benefits 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans are the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan these plans were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2017  measurement date increased to 44092 from 41164 at the end of fiscal year 2016  the projected benefit obligation for these plans was 51071 and 53273 at the end of fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively the net unfunded liability decreased by approximately 513 from 1211 to 698 primarily due to higher discount rates favorable asset experience and the effects of the versum spinoff and the sale of pmd to evonik refer to note 16  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

pension expense 



 2017 vs 2016   

pension expense excluding special items increased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate offset by favorable asset experience special items of 150 included pension settlement losses of 105 related to the us supplementary pension plan curtailment and special termination benefits of 45 25 of which was reflected in business separation costs and 20 reflected in business restructuring and cost reduction actions on the consolidated income statements 

2016 vs 2015 

pension expense excluding special items decreased from fiscal year 2015 due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost and the impacts from expected return on assets and demographic gains partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans special items of 60 included pension settlement losses of 51 special termination benefits of 20 and curtailment gains of 11 these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions  

2018  outlook 

in 2018  pension expense excluding special items is expected to be relatively flat compared to 2017 with a range of approximately 50 to 55 this results from lower loss amortization primarily due to favorable asset experience offset by the impact of lower discount rates and a lower expected return on assets pension settlement losses of 5 to 10 are expected depending on the timing of retirements in 2018 we expect pension expense to include approximately 128 for amortization of actuarial losses in 2017  total company pension expense which includes both continuing and discontinued operations included amortization of actuarial losses of 143 net actuarial losses of 352 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2017  actuarial gainslosses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gainslosses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2018  

as noted in note 2 new accounting guidance to the consolidated financial statements we expect to early adopt guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost in 2018 the amendments require that the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost be presented in the same line items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period the other components of net periodic benefit cost will be presented outside of operating income 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of third party actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2017  and 2016  our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 641 and 793 respectively 

for 2018  cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 50 to 70 the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans which 

are dependent upon the timing of retirements and future cost reduction actions actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on pages 4143  for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 114  122  and 118  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts refer to note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine we estimate that we spent 7  in 2017  3  in 2016  and 2  in 2015  on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately 3  in both 2018  and 2019  

we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 83  to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 97  as of 30 september 2017  the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2017  and 2016  included an accrual of 836  and 814  respectively the accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the pace florida piedmont south carolina 

and pasadena texas locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses refer to note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg including carbon dioxide these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading scheme california and ontario cap and trade schemes alberta’s specified gas emitters regulation china’s emission trading scheme pilots south korea’s emission trading scheme and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions under an ontario cap and trade scheme nationwide expansion of the china emission trading scheme and revisions to the alberta regulation in addition the us environmental protection agency epa requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs   

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and hydrogen production we believe it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products   

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from steam methane reforming enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal could increase demand for oxygen one of our main products and our proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating in the industrial gas business in 2015 we entered into a longterm sale of equipment contract to engineer procure and construct industrial gas facilities with a 25‑owned joint venture for saudi aramco’s jazan oil refinery and power plant in saudi arabia the agreement included terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party sales related to this contract are included in the results of our industrial gases – global segment and were approximately 540  and 300  during fiscal year 2017  and 2016  respectively sales related to this contract were not material during fiscal year 2015  

inflation 

we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2017  totaled 84402  and depreciation expense totaled 8432  during 2017 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

the regional industrial gases segments have numerous longterm customer supply contracts for which we construct an onsite plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset 

our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and for smaller customers packaged gases the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are 

generally 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional industrial gases segments would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 



impairment of assets 

plant and equipment 

plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the longlived asset a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

on 29 march 2016 the board of directors approved the company’s exit of its energyfromwaste business accordingly we assessed the recoverability of capital costs for the two projects associated with this business and recorded an impairment charge to the results of discontinued operations of 9135 to reduce the carrying values of plant assets to their estimated net realizable value we estimated the net realizable value of the projects assuming an orderly liquidation of assets capable of being marketed on a secondary equipment market based on market quotes and our experience with selling similar equipment an asset’s orderly liquidation value is the amount that could be realized from a liquidation sale given a reasonable period of time to find a buyer selling the asset in the existing condition where it is located and assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants the valuation includes inputs that are unobservable and therefore considered level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy the loss was measured as the difference between the orderly liquidation value of the assets and the net book value of the assets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we recorded an additional loss of 63 to update our estimate of the net realizable value of the plant assets as of 31 december 2016 of 110  in addition a charge of 457  was recorded to continuing operations to writedown the air separation unit in the industrials gases–emea segment that was constructed mainly to provide oxygen to one of the energyfromwaste plants to its net realizable value of 14  there have been no changes to our estimates during the remainder of 2017 refer to note 3  discontinued operations  and note 5  business restructuring and cost reduction actions  for additional information 

in the third quarter of 2017 we performed interim impairment testing of our latin america reporting unit lasa longlived assets and indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill as of 30 june 2017 see the discussions below under goodwill and intangible assets on 2017 impairment testing  we also tested the recoverability of lasas longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets subject to amortization and concluded that they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows 

goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity goodwill was 7215  as of 30 september 2017  disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 

we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for more frequent testing the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly we have five business segments and eleven reporting units reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each business segment the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the three regional industrial gases segments 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a quantitative test is required we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing as further described below 

as described in note 2 new accounting guidance to the consolidated financial statements we elected to early adopt the new accounting guidance which simplified the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating step 2 which measured the impairment loss based on the fair value of goodwill under the new guidance an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we initially use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of estimated future cash flows our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capitalintensive nature the longterm contractual nature of our business and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates operating profit andor ebitda margins discount rate and exit multiple projected revenue growth rates and operating profit andor ebitda assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan andor revised forecasts and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate reflects expected longterm growth rates 

if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment when the market approach is utilized fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies andor regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects when both the income and market approach are utilized we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

2017 impairment testing 

for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 volumes declined in our latin america reporting unit lasa and overall revenue growth did not meet expectations due to weak economic conditions in latin america and expectations for continued volume weakness in the latin american countries and markets in which we operate we lowered our longterm growth projections for lasa by more than 200 basis points which also unfavorably impacted our ebitda margin management considered the revised projections for lasa to be indicators of potential impairment and accordingly performed interim impairment testing of our longlived assets and indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill as of 30 june 2017 utilizing the revised projections lasa represents approximately 6 of the company’s total revenue with business units in chile colombia and other latin america countries 

we estimated the fair value of lasa as of 30 june 2017 based on two valuation approaches the income approach and the market approach as described above we reviewed relevant facts and circumstances in determining the weighting of the approaches under the income approach we estimated the fair value of lasa based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and ebitda margins taking into consideration business and market conditions for the latin american countries and markets in which we operate these estimates were consistent with our revised forecast and longterm financial planning processes which included a reduction in sales growth by more than 200 basis points from that previously identified we calculated the discount rate based on a marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which considers industryspecific rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure adjusted for risks associated with business size and geography under the market approach we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publiclytraded industrial gases companies and regional manufacturing companies adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects 

based on the results of the valuations we determined that the goodwill associated with lasa was impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 1453 the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value during the third quarter of 2017 this impairment is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge” this charge was not deductible for tax purposes and has been excluded from segment operating income 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing we determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except lasa for which the fair value equaled the carrying value 

the excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units other than lasa ranged from approximately 80 to approximately 350 management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of these reporting units in this scenario the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 60 to 300 

as of 30 september 2017 the carrying value of latin america goodwill was 673 or less than 1 of consolidated total assets further events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to a decline in market share pricing pressures and further economic weakening in the markets we serve revenue growth and ebitda margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value of lasa we determined that with other assumptions held constant a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 125 basis points or a decrease in ebitda margin of approximately 225 basis points would result in an impairment of the remaining goodwill balance the carrying value of lasas other material assets at 30 september 2017 included plant and equipment net of 3453 customer relationships of 1663 and trade names and trademarks of 469 the trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets 

future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include but are not limited to longterm economic weakness decline in market share pricing pressures inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures increases to our cost of capital and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses negative changes in one or more of these factors among others could result in impairment charges 

we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results or changes in management’s business outlook or strategy 

intangible assets 

intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 september 2017  totaled 3214  and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2017  totaled 469  and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss to determine fair value we utilize the royalty savings method a form of the income approach this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset 

2017 impairment testing 

in the third quarter of 2017 we conducted an interim impairment test and determined that the carrying value of the lasa indefinitelived intangible assets was impaired we determined that the carrying value of trade names and trademarks was in excess of fair value and as a result we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 168 to reduce these indefinitelived intangible assets to their fair value this impairment is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangibles and found no indications of impairment 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 12869  at 30 september 2017  the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8  summarized financial information of equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other‑than‑temporary an impairment loss would be recognized management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach andor market approach we utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach for the market approach we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 abdullah hashim industrial gases  equipment co ltd ahg a 25 ‑owned equity affiliate in our industrial gases – emea segment completed a review of its business plan and outlook as a result of the revised business plan we determined there was an otherthantemporary impairment of our investment in ahg and therefore recorded a noncash impairment charge of 795  to reduce the carrying value of our investment this charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “equity affiliates income” and was not deductible for tax purposes 

the decline in value results from expectations for lower future cash flows to be generated by ahg primarily due to challenging economic conditions in saudi arabia including the impacts of lower prices in the oil and gas industry increased competition and capital project growth opportunities not materializing as anticipated the ahg investment was valued based on the results of the income and market valuation approaches 

the income approach utilized a discount rate based on a marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which considers industry required rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure adjusted for risks associated with size and geography other significant estimates and assumptions that drive our updated valuation of ahg include revenue growth rates and profit margins that were lower than those upon acquisition and our assessment of ahgs business improvement plan effectiveness 

under the market approach we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publiclytraded industrial gases companies engaged in similar lines of business adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects 

as of 30 september 2017  the carrying value of our investment in ahg is 667  and is reflected in our industrial gases – emea segment the investment is reported in “investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates” on our consolidated balance sheets 

revenue recognition –   percentageofcompletion method 

revenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the percentageofcompletion method under this method revenue from the sale of major equipment such as liquefied natural gas lng heat exchangers and large air separation units is recognized based on costs or labor hours incurred to date compared with total estimated costs or labor hours to be incurred we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete the contract and recognize the profit over the life of the contract 

accounting for contracts using the percentageofcompletion method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance schedule and technical issues labor productivity the complexity of work performed the cost and availability of materials and performance of subcontractors when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs or labor hours are required any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inceptiontodate effect of such change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

our jazan large air separation unit sale of equipment project within our industrial gases – global segment spans several years in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and 

construction activities this project requires monitoring of risks associated with schedule geography and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract 

changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method including the jazan project favorably impacted operating income by approximately 27 in fiscal year 2017 and 20 in fiscal year 2016 our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years changes in estimates during fiscal year 2015 were not significant 

we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled at 30 september 2017  accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to 986  and 6039  respectively tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2017  were 1464  excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2017  was 2609  disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 22  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in our effective tax rate would decreaseincrease net income by approximately 14 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 16  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the domestic and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates mortality rates are based on the most recent society of actuaries tables we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans effective in 2016 the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs the company accounted for this as a change in accounting 

estimate and accordingly accounted for it on a prospective basis this change did not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date this rate changes from yeartoyear based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 36 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated longterm returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets in determining estimated asset class returns we take into account historical and future expected longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 19 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets for equities this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur and reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 15 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies ie situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within 

this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and particulars are provided in note 17  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased or our proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded 

new accounting guidance 

in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we adopted guidance requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt instead of as a separate deferred asset the guidance resulted in a reclassification adjustment that decreased other noncurrent assets by 170  with a corresponding decrease to longterm debt as of 30 september 2016 we have elected to continue to present debt issuance costs associated with a lineofcredit arrangement as a deferred asset regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings 

in addition during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we adopted guidance that simplified the accounting for employee sharebased payments the new guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be 

recognized in the income statement rather than in additional paidin capital on the balance sheet as a result of applying this change prospectively we recognized 176  of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes during fiscal year 2017 adoption of this guidance resulted in the presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than a financing activity we applied these presentation changes retrospectively to all periods presented 

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 we elected to early adopt guidance which simplified the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating step 2 which measured the impairment loss based on the fair value of goodwill under the new guidance an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit refer to note 10 goodwill for a discussion of our interim and annual goodwill impairment tests 

see note 2  new accounting guidance  to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into 

transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1  major accounting policies  and note 13  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 14 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 

at 30 september 2017  and 2016  the net financial instrument position was a liability of 38323 and 41956 respectively the decrease in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to the repayment of longterm debt 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2017 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 65 fixedrate debt and 35 variablerate debt our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2016 including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements was composed of 55 fixedrate debt and 45 variablerate debt the change in debt portfolio composition was due primarily to the repayment of commercial paper 

the sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2017  with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 112 and 137 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2017  and 2016  respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 119 and 148 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2017  and 2016  respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 14 and 24 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2017  and 2016  respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 14 and 24 per year at 30 september 2017  and 2016  respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2017  and 2016  with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 312 and 422 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2017  and 2016  respectively the change in exchange rate sensitivity from 30 september 2016 to 30 september 2017 was due primarily to a reduction in our portfolio of forward exchange contracts refer to note 13 financial instruments for additional information about our outstanding forward exchange contracts 

the primary currency pair for which we have exchange rate exposure is euros and us dollars foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

the majority of the company’s sales are derived from outside of the united states and denominated in foreign currencies financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the euro and the chinese renminbi represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings we estimate that a 10 reduction in either the euro or the chinese renminbi versus the us dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 25 and 20 respectively

 item 1a risk factors tableend in conjunction with evaluating an investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should carefully read the following risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

overall economic and supplydemand conditions customer vitality—a weakening economy or product supply versus demand imbalance in markets in which the company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues operating results and cash flows cyclical downturns in the industries served by our customers or adverse economic events or conditions affecting specific customers can in turn have an adverse effect on our business 

demand for the company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which the company does business in the past few years uncertain economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in markets served by the company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or to a particular customer affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility impact utilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to the company resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or inability to recover plant investments negatively impacting our financial results 

weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause elimination of product lines customer shutdowns or default or other inabilities to profitably operate facilities and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or projects not to reach onstream these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on its financial results 

operational economic political and legal risks of international operations—the company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability developing market operations present special risks 

the company has extensive international operations in addition the company is actively investing significant capital and other resources in emerging markets including joint ventures and other alliances the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to project delays due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability some of the company’s contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions nationalization and expropriation risk social unrest strained relations between countries or imposition of international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

our developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including geopolitical legal economic and talent risks our success will depend in part on our ability 

 

to manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market including unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets 

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law as well as us and international economic sanctions we have policies and procedures to foster compliance with these laws including compliance and training programs for our employees and established due diligence procedures with regard to third parties however these cannot eliminate the risk that violations could be committed by our employees agents or joint venture partners violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the company significant fines and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

currency fluctuations—changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

the majority of the company’s revenue is generated from sales outside the united states exposing it to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our industrial gases business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of its foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period our performance materials business is also significantly exposed to transactional currency impacts as many of its products are manufactured in one country and sold in another 

the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate some of these effects the company’s policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates the company chooses not to hedge the translation of its foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a below 

raw material and energy cost and availability—interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the company’s business because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent the company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results

the company’s supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production which may result from natural gas pricing or supplier operating issues or interruptions in sales from other crude helium suppliers can reduce the company’s supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to its customers

the company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results the company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

regulatory compliance—the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact the company’s financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business the application of laws and regulations to the company’s business is sometimes unclear 

 

compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so export restrictions continue to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the company’s businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject the company to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs 

environmental compliance—costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” above 

we may not be able to successfully control or reduce costs to improve productivity and streamline operations reorganization and cost reduction efforts can disrupt operations 

achieving our financial goals including continued profitability and margin growth depends significantly on our efforts to control or reduce our operating costs including our ability to eliminate stranded costs related to our divested businesses because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency and repositioning actions if we are not able to identify and execute efforts designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency our ability to attain our goals could be adversely impacted 

ongoing restructuring and cost reduction actions may reduce our available talent and other resources impact our ability to attract and retain key employees slow improvements in our products and services and adversely affect our ability to respond to customers failure to achieve targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions these circumstances could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

interest rate increases—the company’s earnings cash flows and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases and access to credit 

at 30 september 2016 the company had total consolidated debt of 62252 million including versum debt of 9972 million of which 13071 million including versum debt of 58 million will mature in the next twelve months the company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt although the company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates if interest rates increase the company’s interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes in addition changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing and weaken our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us for a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk see item 7a below 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions and divestitures may not occur as planned 

we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all in 

 

addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections or insurance with respect to divested businesses our results may be impacted by claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification 

catastrophic events—catastrophic events could disrupt the company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the company’s business financial results and cash flows 

the company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the company’s control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact the company’s suppliers or customers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the company’s products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

operational risks—operational and execution risks may adversely affect the company’s operations or financial results 

the company’s operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the company’s ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows in addition the company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements which depends in part on the company’s ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets operating results are also dependent on the company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements which depends in part on the availability of adequate sources of labor in the geographies where the company intends to build new plants failure to do so may expose the company to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

information security—the security of the company’s information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and services providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information or multiple site impact through a security breach as with all large systems our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information disrupting business processes or causing harm to persons or property the company’s systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to sophisticated cyber security threats to date the company is not aware of any significant impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business involves the use storage and transmission of information about its employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as the company’s information is critical to the company the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements the company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information the company also from time to time exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception 

 

could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

litigation and regulatory proceedings—the company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material while the company seeks to limit its liability in its commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable at law also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 

greenhouse gases—legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading scheme california’s cap and trade scheme alberta’s emission reduction program china’s emission trading scheme pilots south korea’s emission trading scheme and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions under an ontario cap and trade scheme nationwide expansion of the china emission trading scheme and federal emission performance standards in canada in addition the us environmental protection agency epa requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities moreover some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector eg us epa clean power plan to achieve emission reductions these reductions often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase the company’s costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could impact the company’s growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products 

the results of the united kingdom’s “uk” european union “eu” membership referendum could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements 

the results of the uk’s eu membership referendum advising for the exit of the uk from the eu has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty which could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements 

competition—inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of its business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the company’s products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could affect the company’s profitability or its market share 

 

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff of versum qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from versum and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the spinoff is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including contract product liability intellectual property insurance and regulatory matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

the company is a party to proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar 

 

state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are approximately 33 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 55 million at 30 september 2016 on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts on 6 may 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against air products brasil ltda was dismissed cade has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

other than this matter we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

changes in diluted earnings per share attributable to air products 

 

 2017 outlook 

for 2017 we intend to remain focused on key actions we can control to continue to drive earnings growth we intend to accomplish this by bringing new industrial gas plant investments onstream making progress on the jazan sale of equipment project and continuing to deliver on cost reduction actions we expect continued weakness in new lng equipment orders primarily driven by low oil and natural gas prices

business separation costs 

on 16 september 2015 the company announced plans to separate its materials technologies business which contains two divisions electronic materials emd and performance materials pmd into an independent publicly traded company and distribute to air products shareholders all of the shares of the new public company in a tax free distribution a “spinoff” versum materials llc or versum was formed as the new company to hold the materials technologies business subject to the spinoff on 6 may 2016 the company entered into an agreement to sell certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the pmd division to evonik industries ag for 38 billion in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities as a result the company moved forward with the planned spinoff of versum containing only the emd division 

on 1 october 2016 air products completed the separation of its emd division through the spinoff of versum as a result the historical results of emd will be presented as a discontinued operation beginning in fiscal year 2017 we continue to evaluate the progress of the sale of the pmd division to determine when it should be presented as a discontinued operation 

in fiscal year 2016 we incurred separation costs of 522 483 aftertax or 22 per share primarily related to legal advisory and indirect tax costs associated with these transactions the costs are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “business separation costs” a significant portion of these costs were not tax deductible because they were directly related to the plan for the taxfree spinoff of versum our income tax provision includes additional tax expense related to the separation of 518 24 per share of which 457 resulted from a dividend declared during the third quarter of 2016 to repatriate 4438 from a subsidiary in south korea to the us previously most of these foreign earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we expect to incur additional legal and advisory fees in fiscal 2017

interest expense 

 2016 vs 2015 

interest incurred decreased 42 the decrease primarily resulted from a stronger us dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest of 6 partially offset by a higher average debt balance of 2 the change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in the carrying value of projects under construction primarily as a result of our exit from the energyfromwaste business 

2015 vs 2014

effective tax rate 

the effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes refer to note 23 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate 

2016 vs 2015 

on a gaap basis the effective tax rate was 275 and 240 in 2016 and 2015 respectively the change included a 240 bp impact from tax costs associated with business separation primarily resulting from a dividend declared in 2016 to repatriate cash from a foreign subsidiary as discussed above in “business separation costs” the remaining 110 bp change was primarily due to the increase in mix of income in jurisdictions with a higher effective tax rate and the impact of business separation costs for which a tax benefit was not available on a nongaap basis the effective tax rate increased from 242 in 2015 to 248 in 2016 primarily due to the increase in and mix of income in jurisdictions with a higher effective tax rate 

 

2015 vs 2014 

on a gaap basis the effective tax rate was 240 and 271 in 2015 and 2014 respectively the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of 3052 which was not deductible for tax purposes and the chilean tax reform enacted in september 2014 which increased income tax expense by 206 these impacts were partially offset by an income tax benefit of 516 associated with losses from transactions and a tax election in a nonus subsidiary refer to note 10 goodwill and note 23 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on a nongaap basis the effective tax rate was 242 and 241 in 2015 and 2014 respectively

discontinued operations 

on 29 march 2016 the board of directors approved the company’s exit of its energyfromwaste efw business as a result efforts to start up and operate its two efw projects located in tees valley united kingdom have been discontinued the decision to exit the business and stop development of the projects was based on continued difficulties encountered and the company’s conclusion based on testing and analysis completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 that significant additional time and resources would be required to make the projects operational in addition the decision allows the company to execute its strategy of focusing resources on its core industrial gases business the efw segment has been presented as a discontinued operation prior year efw business segment information has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 

in fiscal 2016 our loss from discontinued operations net of tax of 8842 primarily resulted from the write down of assets to their estimated net realizable value and to record a liability for plant disposition and other costs income tax benefits related only to one of the projects as the other did not qualify for a local tax deduction the loss from discontinued operations also includes land lease costs commercial and administrative costs and costs incurred for ongoing project exit activities 

we expect additional exit costs of 50 to 100 to be recorded in future periods 

in fiscal 2015 our loss from discontinued operations net of tax related to efw was 68 this resulted from costs for land leases and commercial and administrative expenses 

in fiscal 2014 our loss from discontinued operations net of tax was 29 this included a loss net of tax of 75 for the cost of efw land leases and commercial and administrative expenses this loss was partially offset by a gain of 39 for the sale of the remaining homecare business and settlement of contingencies related to a sale of a separate portion of the business to the linde group in 2012

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated except for share data 

the company has presented certain financial measures on a nongaap “adjusted” basis and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap these financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap the company believes these nongaap measures provide investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results 

in many cases our nongaap measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to exclude certain disclosed items “nongaap adjustments” that we believe are not representative of the underlying business performance for example air products is currently executing its strategic plan to restructure the company and to focus on the company’s core industrial gases businesses which has and will continue to result in significant disclosed items that we believe are important for investors to understand separately from the performance of the underlying business the tax impact of our nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions in evaluating these financial measures the reader should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation in the future investors should also consider the limitations associated with these nongaap measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another 

presented below are reconciliations of the reported gaap results to the nongaap measures 

 

consolidated results 

 

  

  

     adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as income from continuing operations including noncontrolling interests excluding certain disclosed items which the company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends before interest expense income tax provision and depreciation and amortization expense adjusted ebitda provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance 

below is a reconciliation of income from continuing operations on a gaap basis to adjusted ebitda 

 

 a includes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

b reflected on the consolidated income statements in “other income expense net” 

 

below is a summary of segment operating income 

 

  

below is a reconciliation of segment operating income to adjusted ebitda 

 

 a adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by sales 

 

income taxes 

the tax impact of our nongaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions

for the year ended 2015 cash used by discontinued operations was 3578 the use of cash was primarily driven by expenditures for plant and equipment of 3492 related to the energyfromwaste facilities refer to note 4 discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for the year ended 2014 cash used by discontinued operations was 4718 the use of cash was driven by capital expenditures of 3215 for our energyfromwaste facilities and a payment made to the linde group for contingent proceeds we were obligated to return from the sale of our homecare business of 1571 refer to note 4 discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

financing and capital structure 

capital needs in 2016 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations at the end of 2016 total debt outstanding was 62252 compared to 58790 at the end of 2015 and cash and cash items were 15013 compared to 2064 at the end of 2015 total debt at 30 september 2016 and 2015 expressed as a percentage of total capitalization total debt plus total equity was 463 and 443 respectively 

during fiscal 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 25000 revolving credit agreement maturing 30 april 2018 with a syndicate of banks the “2013 credit agreement” under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries there have been subsequent amendments to the 2013 credit agreement and as of 30 september 2016 the maximum borrowing capacity was 26900 the 2013 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity for the company and supports its commercial paper program this credit facility includes a financial covenant for a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization no greater than 70 no borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement as of 30 september 2016 

during september 2016 in anticipation of the versum spinoff versum entered into certain financing transactions to allow for a cash distribution of 5500 and a distribution inkind of notes issued by versum with an aggregate principal amount of 4250 to air products air products then exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for 4183 of air products’ outstanding commercial paper since versum debt was issued in september but versum did not become a separate entity until 1 october 2016 air products’ consolidated balance sheet includes the versum debt the 5750 term loan and the 4250 of notes were included in the versum spinoff transaction and do not represent obligation of the company in the future in addition versum entered into a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility versum revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of 2000 that matures on 30 september 2021 lenders under the revolving facility have a maximum first lien net leverage ratio covenant total debt net of cash on hand to total adjusted ebitda of 325100 and certain other customary covenants no borrowings were outstanding on the versum revolving facility as of 30 september 2016 refer to note 3 materials technologies separation to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

commitments totaling 513 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries all of which was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2016 

as of 30 september 2016 we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 

on 15 september 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 of our outstanding common stock we did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2016 2015 or 2014 at 30 september 2016 4853 in share repurchase authorization remains 

2017 outlook 

cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future and our working capital balance was 10340 at 30 september 2016 we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants 

we expect to utilize the proceeds from the distribution from versum to pay down debt largely commercial paper in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 

dividends 

dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter during 2016 the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from 81 per share to 86 per share 

 

contractual obligations 

we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations the following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 september 2016 

 

 longterm debt obligations 

the longterm debt obligations include the maturity payments of longterm debt including current portion and the related contractual interest obligations refer to note 15 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on longterm debt 

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the longterm debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest we had 1396 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2016 excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2016 variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates 

consistent with the debt maturities table within note 15 debt the longterm debt obligations reflect financing entered into in anticipation of the spinoff of emd as versum materials inc the spinoff was completed on 1 october 2016 and the related debt of 9972 was maintained by versum 

leases 

refer to note 12 leases to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities refer to note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

unconditional purchase obligations 

approximately 4000 of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium purchases which include crude feedstock supply to multiple helium refining plants in north america as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world as a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector these helium sourcing agreements are medium to longterm and contain takeorpay provisions the refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas primarily under mediumterm requirements contracts while contract terms in the energy sector are longer than those in merchant helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties 

approximately 330 of our longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to 

 

the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations 

the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations which are primarily passthrough contracts with our customers 

purchase commitments to spend approximately 350 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2017 in addition we have purchase commitments totaling approximately 500 in 2017 and 2018 relating to our longterm sale of equipment project for saudi aramco’s jazan oil refinery 

we also purchase materials energy capital equipment supplies and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy which are obtained under requirementstype contracts at market prices 

obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate 

on 19 april 2015 a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan saudi arabia air products owns 25 of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan in total we expect to invest approximately 100 in this joint venture as of 30 september 2016 we recorded a noncurrent liability of 944 for our obligation to make future equity contributions based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan 

income tax liabilities 

noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 september 2016 were 7671 tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2016 were 1069 these tax liabilities were excluded from the contractual obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws tax rates and our operating results in addition there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities refer to note 23 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

p ension benefits 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans are the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan these plans were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans over the long run the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2016 measurement date increased to 41164 from 39164 at the end of fiscal year 2015 the projected benefit obligation for these plans was 53273 and 47878 at the end of the fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively the net unfunded liability increased by approximately 340 from 871 to 1211 due primarily to lower discount rates refer to note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

 

pension expense 

 

  2016 vs 2015 

pension expense excluding special items decreased from the prior year due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost the impact from expected return on assets and demographic gains partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans special items of 73 included pension settlement losses of 64 special termination benefits of 20 and curtailment gains of 11 these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions

2015 vs 2014 

the decrease in pension expense excluding special items was due to the impact from expected return on assets a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption and lower service cost and interest cost the decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate special items of 352 included pension settlement losses of 212 special termination benefits of 87 and curtailment losses of 53 these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions 

2017 outlook 

in 2017 pension expense excluding special items is estimated to be approximately 70 to 75 an increase of 10 to 15 from 2016 resulting primarily from a decrease in discount rates offset by favorable asset experience effects of the versum spinoff and the adoption of new mortality tables pension settlement losses of 10 to 15 are expected dependent on the timing of retirements in 2017 we expect pension expense to include approximately 164 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to 121 in 2016 net actuarial losses of 484 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2016 primarily attributable to lower discount rates and improved mortality projections actuarial gainslosses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gainslosses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2017 

during the first quarter of 2017 the company expects to record a curtailment loss estimated to be 5 to 10 related to employees transferring to versum the loss will be reflected in the results from discontinued operations on the consolidated income statements we continue to evaluate opportunities to manage the liabilities associated with our pension plans 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of third party actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2016 and 2015 our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 793 and 1375 respectively 

for 2017 cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 65 to 85 the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans which 

 

are dependent upon the timing of retirements and future cost reduction actions actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 45 for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 270 283 and 351 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine we estimate that we spent 7 and 4 in 2016 and 2015 respectively on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately 3 in both 2017 and 2018 

we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 81 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 95 as of 30 september 2016 the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2016 and 2015 included an accrual of 814 and 806 respectively the accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the pace florida piedmont south carolina and pasadena texas locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme california’s cap and trade scheme south korea’s emission trading scheme alberta’s specified gases emitter regulation and beginning in 2017 the ontario cap and trade scheme and china national emission trading scheme where these regulations impose compliance costs on our hydrogen production facilities california alberta and ontario we have been able to mitigate the majority of such costs through our contractual terms 

increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the longterm impact on us any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in 

 

addition the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen one of our main products and our proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating in the industrial gas business in 2015 we entered into a longterm sale of equipment contract to engineer procure and construct industrial gas facilities with a 25 owned joint venture for saudi aramco’s jazan oil refinery and power plant in saudi arabia the agreement included terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party sales related to this contract are included in the results of our industrial gases – global segment and were approximately 300 during fiscal year 2016 and were not material during fiscal year 2015 

inflation 

we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2016 totaled 88527 and depreciation expense totaled 8930 during 2016 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

the regional industrial gases segments have numerous longterm customer supply contracts for which we construct an onsite plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset 

our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and for smaller customers packaged gases the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are 

 

generally 15 years the depreciable lives of production facilities within the materials technologies segment where there is not an associated longterm supply agreement range from 10 to 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional industrial gases segments and materials technologies segment would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 

 

 impairment of assets 

plant and equipment 

plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the longlived asset a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

on 29 march 2016 the board of directors approved the company’s exit of its energyfromwaste business accordingly we assessed the recoverability of capital costs for the two projects associated with this business and recorded an impairment charge of 9135 to reduce the carrying values of plant assets to their estimated net realizable value of 20 we estimated the net realizable value of the projects assuming an orderly liquidation of assets capable of being marketed on a secondary equipment market based on market quotes and our experience with selling similar equipment an asset’s orderly liquidation value is the amount that could be realized from a liquidation sale given a reasonable period of time to find a buyer selling the asset in the existing condition where it is located and assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants the valuation includes inputs that are unobservable and therefore considered level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy the loss was measured as the difference between the orderly liquidation value of the assets and the net book value of the assets refer to note 4 discontinued operations for additional information there have been no significant changes in the estimated net realizable value as of 30 september 2016 

goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable 

 

intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity goodwill was 11502 as of 30 september 2016 disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10 goodwill to the consolidated financial statements 

we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for more frequent testing the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly as of 30 september 2016 we had six business segments and thirteen reporting units reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each business segment the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the three regional industrial gases segments and the materials technologies segment 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a twostep quantitative test is required we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing as further described below

the first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value including assigned goodwill to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we initially use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of estimated future cash flows our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capitalintensive nature the longterm contractual nature of our business and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates operating profit margins discount rate and exit multiple projected revenue growth rates and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate reflects expected longterm growth rates if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment when the market approach is utilized fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects when both the income and market approach are utilized we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in an analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

in 2014 we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing as of 1 july 2014 and concluded that the goodwill associated with the latin america reporting unit was impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 3052 the latin america reporting unit is composed predominately of our indura business with business units in chile colombia and other latin america countries which the company acquired in 2012 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing noting no indications of impairment the fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value 

the excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units ranged from approximately 30 to approximately 350 management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of 

 

these reporting units in this scenario the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 15 to 300 

future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include but are not limited to longterm economic weakness decline in market share pricing pressures inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures increases to our cost of capital and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses negative changes in one or more of these factors among others could result in impairment charges 

we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results or changes in management’s business outlook or strategy 

intangible assets 

intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 september 2016 totaled 4253 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2016 totaled 627 and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss to determine fair value we utilize the royalty savings method a form of the income approach this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we conducted our annual impairment test and determined that our indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired refer to note 11 intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangibles and found no indications of impairment 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 12881 at 30 september 2016 the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8 summarized financial information of equity affiliates to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary an impairment loss would be recognized management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

revenue recognition percentageofcompletion method 

revenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the percentageofcompletion method under this method revenue from the sale of major equipment such as liquefied natural gas lng heat exchangers and large air separation units is recognized based on labor hours or costs incurred to date compared with total estimated labor hours or costs to be incurred depending on the nature of the project and the best measure of progress toward completion we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete the contract and recognize the profit over the life of the contract 

accounting for contracts using the percentageofcompletion method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs our estimates are impacted by factors 

 

such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance schedule and technical issues labor productivity the complexity of work performed the cost and availability of materials and performance of subcontractors when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs or labor hours are required any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inceptiontodate effect of such change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

our jazan large air separation unit sale of equipment project within our industrial gases – global segment spans several years in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities this project requires monitoring of risks associated with schedule geography and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract given the revenue and cost uncertainties associated with these risks we recognized revenue and cost with no estimated profit through the third quarter of 2016 during the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of progress toward completion and a reassessment of revenue and cost risks we changed our estimated profit on the project and recognized the inceptiontodate effect of that change associated with approximately 300 of revenue 

changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method including the jazan project favorably impacted operating income by approximately 20 in fiscal year 2016 primarily during the fourth quarter our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years changes in estimates during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were not significant 

we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled at 30 september 2016 accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to 1466 and 5744 respectively tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2016 were 1069 excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2016 was 5865 disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 23 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in our effective tax rate would decreaseincrease net income by approximately 21 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the domestic and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover in fiscal year 2016 the beginningofyear projected benefit obligation and benefit costs for the us plans reflect the adoption of the new society of actuaries rp2014 mortality table projected with scale bb2d as of 30 september 2016 the projected benefit obligation reflects the adoption of the new mortality projection scale mp2016 for the us plans our mortality assumptions will differ from the irs mortality assumptions used to determine funding valuations as the irs is not expected to adopt the new tables until 2018 or later

one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans effective in 2016 the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs the company has accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly has accounted for it on a prospective basis this change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date this rate will change from yeartoyear based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 33 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated longterm returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets in determining estimated asset class returns we take into account historical and future expected longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 19 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets for equities this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur and reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 16 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies ie situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within 

 

this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and particulars are provided in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased or our proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded 

new accounting guidance 

as of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 we adopted guidance on the presentation of deferred income taxes that resulted in all deferred tax liabilities and assets being classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet accordingly prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation the guidance which did not change the existing requirement to net deferred tax assets and liabilities within a jurisdiction resulted in a reclassification adjustment that increased noncurrent deferred tax assets by 137 and decreased noncurrent deferred tax liabilities by 999 as of 30 september 2015 

see note 2 new accounting guidance to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into 

 

transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1 major accounting policies and note 13 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 14 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 

at 30 september 2016 and 2015 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 51877 and 44520 respectively the increase in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to the issuance of longterm debt by versum which included senior unsecured notes 4250 and a fully drawn term loan facility 5750 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2016 including the effect of currency swap agreements primarily comprised debt denominated in us dollars 37 and euros 33 this debt portfolio is composed of 53 fixedrate debt and 47 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

the sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2016 with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 161 and 139 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2016 and 2015 respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 178 and 151 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2016 and 2015 respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 29 and 30 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2016 and 2015 respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 29 and 30 per year at 30 september 2016 and 2015 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2016 and 2015 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 438 and 421 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2016 and 2015 respectively

the primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are euros and us dollars and british pound sterling and us dollars foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

 

the majority of the company’s sales are derived from outside of the united states and denominated in foreign currencies financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the euro and the chinese renminbi represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings we estimate that a 10 reduction in either the euro or the chinese renminbi versus the us dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 20 and 15 respectively

narrative description of business by segments 

industrial gases business 

the company’s industrial gases business produces atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gases process gases hydrogen helium carbon dioxide carbon monoxide syngas and specialty gases and equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent process gases are produced by methods other than air separation for example hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas or by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries and helium is produced mainly as a byproduct of natural gas production and purified before resale the company has recently pioneered new technology for extracting helium from a carbon dioxide steam 

the company’s industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally the regional industrial gases segments americas emea and asia include the results of our regional industrial gases businesses which supply gases and related equipment in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in metals glass chemical processing electronics energy production and refining food processing metallurgical industries medical and general manufacturing hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels the chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals the energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen for inerting is used in various fields including the metallurgical chemical and semiconductor industries helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance 

we distribute gases to our customers through a variety of supply modes 

liquid bulk —product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed typically by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases —small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states the company’s packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries 

onsite gases —large quantities of hydrogen carbon monoxide nitrogen oxygen and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are provided to customers principally the energy production and refining chemical and metallurgical industries worldwide who require large volumes of gases that have relatively constant demand gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by 15 to 20 year contracts the company also delivers small quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically either via a 10 to 15 year sale of gas contract or through the sale of the equipment to the customer 

electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases and natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas production we mitigate energy and natural gas price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough arrangements during fiscal year 2015 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas 

the regional industrial gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method the largest of these joint ventures operate in mexico italy south africa india saudi arabia and thailand

working capital 

due to the anticipated spinoff of our materials technologies business in 2016 our debt portfolio has a higher balance of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt due within the next 12 months which has resulted in negative working capital as of 30 september 2015 maintaining the shortterm borrowing balance at its current level provides flexibility in how we manage cash flows associated with the anticipated spinoff

 item 1a risk factors tableend in conjunction with evaluating an investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should carefully read the following risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

overall economic and supplydemand conditions—a weakening or reversal of economic recovery or product supply versus demand imbalance in certain markets in which the company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues operating results and cash flow 

demand for the company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business in the past few years uncertain economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in markets served by the company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility impact new project onstream timing or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment 

operational political and legal risks of international operations—the company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability developing market operations present special risks 

the company has extensive international operations in addition the company is actively investing significant capital and other resources in emerging markets the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to project delays due to unanticipated government actions and to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions social unrest or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition results of operation and cash flow 

our developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including geopolitical legal economic and talent risks our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market including unfamiliar regulatory environments new relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets 

currency fluctuations—changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

the majority of the company’s revenue is generated from sales outside the united states exposing it to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our industrial gases business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of its foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period our materials technologies business is also significantly exposed to transactional currency impacts as many of its products are manufactured in one country and sold in another 

the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate some of these effects the company’s policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates the company chooses not to hedge the translation of its foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows 

 

and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a below 

interest rate increases—the company’s earnings cash flow and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases and access to credit 

at 30 september 2015 the company had total consolidated debt of 58790 million of which 19299 million will mature in the next twelve months the company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt although the company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates if interest rates increase the company’s interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes in addition changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing and weaken our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us for a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk see item 7a below 

new technologies—new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

a number of new technologies and new product offerings are being developed or implemented by the company some of our existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties damage to our reputation or impairment of assets in particular the company has invested approximately 1 billion to date into two wastetoenergy projects in tees valley united kingdom which rely on technological processes that have not been commercialized to date at the same scale or in the same combination the company has experienced technical challenges and onstream delays in starting up the first of these projects and as a result additional capital investments are expected 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

we reorganized the company effective 1 october 2014 this reorganization and our cost reduction measures may reduce our available talent and other resources impact our ability to attract and retain key employees could slow improvements in our products and services and adversely affect our ability to respond to customers failure to achieve targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions these circumstances could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

raw material and energy cost and availability—interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the company’s business because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent the company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results 

the company’s supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production which may result from natural gas pricing or supplier operating issues or interruptions in sales from other crude helium suppliers can reduce the company’s supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to its customers 

the materials technologies segment uses a wide variety of raw materials including alcohols ethyleneamines cyclohexylamine acrylonitriles and glycols shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results 

the company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results the company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw material 

 

costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

regulatory compliance—the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact the company’s financial condition results of operation and cash flow 

the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business the application of laws and regulations to the company’s business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so export restrictions continue to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the company’s businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject the company to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs we have internal control policies and procedures to foster compliance with these laws including compliance and training programs for our employees and established due diligence procedures with regard to third parties however the foregoing cannot eliminate the risk that violations could be committed by our employees agents or joint venture partners 

greenhouse gases—legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading scheme california’s cap and trade scheme alberta’s emission reduction program china’s emission trading scheme pilots south korea’s emission trading scheme and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions under an ontario cap and trade scheme nationwide expansion of the china emission trading scheme and federal emission performance standards in canada in addition the us environmental protection agency epa requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities moreover some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector eg us epa clean power plan to achieve emission reductions these reductions often result in higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase the company’s costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could impact the company’s growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products 

environmental compliance—costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” above 

 

we may not be able to successfully control or reduce costs to improve productivity and streamline operations 

achieving our financial goals depends significantly on our efforts to control or reduce our operating costs because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency if we are not able to identify and execute efforts designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency our ability to attain our goals could be adversely impacted 

catastrophic events—catastrophic events could disrupt the company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the company’s business financial results and cash flow 

the company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the company’s control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact the company’s suppliers or customers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the company’s products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

operational risks—operational and execution risks may adversely affect the company’s operations or financial results 

the company’s operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the company’s ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flow in addition the company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements which depends in part on the company’s ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets operating results are also dependent on the company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements which depends in part on the availability of adequate sources of labor in the geographies where the company intends to build new plants failure to do so may expose the company to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

information security—the security of the company’s information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and services providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information or multiple site impact through a security breach as with all large systems our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information disrupting business processes or causing harm to persons or property the company’s systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to sophisticated cyber security threats to date the company is not aware of any significant impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business involves the use storage and transmission of information about its employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as the company’s information is critical to the company the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements the company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information the company also from time to time exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the 

 

potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

litigation and regulatory proceedings—the company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material while the company seeks to limit its liability in its commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable at law also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flow in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company see item 3 below 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws or fail to protect our confidential information any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and increased costs of compliance and damage our reputation 

asset impairments—the company may be required to record impairment on its longlived assets 

weak demand may cause underutilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines contract terminations customer shutdowns or default or other inability to profitably operate facilities may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or projects not to reach onstream and contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on its financial results if the company is unable to recover its investment in the tees valley wastetoenergy projects the company may record an impairment on those investments 

competition—inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of its business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the company’s products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could affect the company’s profitability or its market share 

the proposed spinoff of our materials technologies business may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

there can be no assurance that the spinoff of materials technologies will be completed in the contemplated manner or timeframe or at all if the spinoff transaction is not completed in the contemplated manner or timeframe or not completed at all among other things the price of the company’s stock may decline 

we cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the proposed transaction will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved if at all for example there can be no assurance that analysts and investors will place values on each of the independent companies that combined will equal the current trading value of the 

 

company in addition if the proposed spinoff is consummated our operational and financial profile will change and we will face new risks including the possibility of reduced financial resources and less diversification of our revenue sources which could adversely impact our future results also the changes in our operational and financial profile may not coincide with some of our shareholders’ investment strategies which could cause investors to sell their shares and otherwise decrease demand for the company’s common stock excess selling could cause the relative market price of our common stock to decrease and be subject to greater volatility following the consummation of the proposed spinoff 

if the spinoff of the materials technologies business together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the company and its shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

a condition to the spinoff of the materials technologies business is the receipt by us of an opinion of tax counsel substantively to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares to our shareholders will qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code notwithstanding receipt of an opinion of tax counsel the us internal revenue service could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the opinion are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion in addition we intend for certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment under federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes the company and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment we would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if we had sold the common stock of the new company in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the common stock received in the distribution in addition if certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law the company could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including contract product liability intellectual property and insurance matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

the company is a party to proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are approximately 37 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 45 million at 30 september 2015 on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts on 6 may 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against air products brasil ltda was dismissed cade has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these or any other legal proceeding would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or net cash flows a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated except for share data 

the discussion of our annual results includes comparisons to nongaap financial measures including adjusted ebitda the presentation of nongaap measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which management uses internally to evaluate our operating performance 

we use nongaap measures to assess our operating performance by excluding certain disclosed items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business we believe nongaap financial measures provide investors with meaningful information to understand our underlying operating results and to analyze financial and business trends nongaap financial measures including adjusted ebitda should not be viewed in isolation are not a substitute for gaap measures and have limitations which include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

 a reader may find any one or all of these items important in evaluating our performance management compensates for the limitations of using nongaap financial measures by using them only to supplement our gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business in evaluating these financial measures the reader should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation in the future 

in 2013 we had pension settlement losses of 124 78 aftertax or 04 per share these impacts were included in the nongaap operating performance measures for fiscal year 2013

  capital expenditures on a gaap basis in 2015 totaled 16536 compared to 16822 in 2014 the decrease of 286 was primarily due to a stronger us dollar which reduced the value of foreign currency capital expenditures partially offset by acquisitions in 2015 additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine ongoing nature including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements spending in 2015 and 2014 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification in china hydrogen to the global market and renewable energy in the uk 

in 2013 we completed three acquisitions with an aggregate cash use net of cash acquired of 2249 in the fourth quarter we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in guiyang china during the third quarter we acquired epco carbondioxide products inc the largest independent us producer of liquid carbon dioxide and wuxi chemgas company ltd refer to note 6 business combinations to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisitions 

capital expenditures on a nongaap basis in 2015 totaled 20276 compared to 18851 in 2014 this increase was primarily due to the purchase of the 305 equity interest in our indura sa subsidiary from the largest minority shareholder for 2779 refer to note 21 noncontrolling interests to the consolidated financial statements for additional details additionally capital lease expenditures of 956 decreased by 1068 reflecting lower project spending 

on 19 april 2015 a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan saudi arabia air products owns 25 of the joint venture and expects to invest approximately 100 air products has also entered into a sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer procure and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply the gases to saudi aramco 

sales backlog represents our estimate of revenue to be recognized in the future on sale of equipment orders and related process technology that are under firm contracts the sales backlog for the company at 30 september 2015 was 1931 compared to 520 at 30 september 2014 the increase in the sales backlog includes a new contract with one of our joint ventures in saudi arabia for the construction of an industrial gas facility that will supply gases to saudi aramco 

2016 outlook 

excluding acquisitions capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2016 are expected to be between 1500 and 1600 a majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations in addition we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates 

 

financing activities 

for the year ended 2015 cash used for financing activities was 9454 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of 6775 and payments for subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interest of 2784 which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of 1213 our borrowings short and longterm proceeds net of repayments were a net use of cash repayment of 859 and included 2840 of net commercial paper and other shortterm debt issuances debt proceeds from the issuance of a 10 eurobond of € 300 million 3353 repayment of a 3875 eurobond of € 300 million 3359 repayment of industrial revenue bonds totaling 1472 and repayment of 3000000 unidades de fomento “uf” series e 630 bonds totaling 1466 refer to note 15 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

for the year ended 2014 cash used for financing activities was 5043 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of 6277 which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of 1416 our borrowings short and longterm proceeds net of repayments were a net source of cash issuance of 11 and included 1487 of net commercial paper and other shortterm debt issuances debt proceeds from the issuance of a 400 senior fixedrate 335 note on 31 july 2014 and 610 of other primarily international debt issuances and debt repayments of a 375 eurobond of € 300 million 4010 in november 2013 and 2076 of other primarily international debt 

for the year ended 2013 cash provided by financing activities was 1154 our borrowings short and longterm proceeds net of repayments were a net source of cash issuance of 9274 and included 4377 of net commercial paper and other shortterm debt issuances and the issuances of a € 300 million 397 20 eurobond on 7 august 2013 and a 4000 senior fixedrate 275 note on 4 february 2013 which were partially offset by the repayment of a 3000 senior fixedrate 415 note on 1 february 2013 proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash of 2264 the primary uses of cash were to purchase 57 million shares of treasury stock for 4616 and to pay dividends of 5656 

discontinued operations 

for the year ended 2015 there were no discontinued operations 

for the year ended 2014 cash used for discontinued operations was 1466 and primarily included a payment made to the linde group for contingent proceeds we were obligated to return from the sale of our homecare business for the year ended 2013 cash provided by discontinued operations was 131 refer to note 4 discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financing and capital structure 

capital needs in 2015 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations at the end of 2015 total debt outstanding was 58790 compared to 61185 at the end of 2014 and cash and cash items were 2064 compared to 3366 at the end of 2014 total debt at 30 september 2015 and 2014 expressed as a percentage of total capitalization total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest was 443 and 439 respectively 

during fiscal 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 25000 revolving credit agreement maturing 30 april 2018 with a syndicate of banks the “2013 credit agreement” under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries there have been subsequent amendments to the 2013 credit agreement and as of 30 september 2015 the maximum borrowing capacity was 26900 the 2013 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity for the company and supports its commercial paper program this credit facility includes a financial covenant for a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest no greater than 70 no borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement as of 30 september 2015 

commitments totaling 1194 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries of which 1106 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2015 

as of 30 september 2015 we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 

on 15 september 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 of our outstanding common stock during fiscal year 2013 57 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of 4616 we did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 at 30 september 2015 4853 in share repurchase authorization remains 

 

2016 outlook 

cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we project a modest need to access the longterm debt markets in 2016 primarily to refinance maturing longterm debt we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants also we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other shortterm debt markets at 30 september our working capital balance was 737 primarily due to 19299 of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt due within the next 12 months maintaining the shortterm borrowings balance at its current level provides flexibility in how we manage cash flows associated with the anticipated spinoff of our materials technologies business in 2016 

dividends 

dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter during 2015 the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from 77 per share to 81 per share 

contractual obligations 

we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations the following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 september 2015 

 

 longterm debt obligations 

the longterm debt obligations include the maturity payments of longterm debt including current portion and the related contractual interest obligations refer to note 15 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on longterm debt 

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the longterm debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest we had 929 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2015 excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2015 variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates 

leases 

refer to note 12 leases to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities refer to note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

 

unconditional purchase obligations 

approximately 390 of our longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations 

the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations which are primarily passthrough contracts with our customers in addition purchase commitments to spend approximately 540 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2016 

we also purchase materials energy capital equipment supplies and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy which are obtained under requirementstype contracts at market prices 

obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate 

on 19 april 2015 a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan saudi arabia air products owns 25 of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan in total we expect to invest approximately 100 in this joint venture as of 30 september 2015 we recorded a noncurrent liability of 675 for our obligation to make future equity contributions based on advances received by the joint venture under the loan 

income tax liabilities 

noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 september 2015 were 9033 tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2015 were 975 these tax liabilities were excluded from the contractual obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws tax rates and our operating results in addition there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities refer to note 23 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pension benefits 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans—the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans over the long run the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2015 measurement date decreased to 39164 from 41146 at the end of fiscal year 2014 the projected benefit obligation for these plans was 47878 and 47386 at the end of the fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively refer to note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

pension expense 

 

  

2015 vs 2014 

pension expense excluding special items decreased from the prior year due to the impact from expected return on assets a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption and lower service cost and interest cost this was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate special items of 352 included pension settlement losses of 212 special termination benefits of 87 and curtailment losses of 53 these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions 

2014 vs 2013 

the decrease in pension expense excluding special items was primarily attributable to the 60 bp increase in weighted average discount rate which resulted in lower amortization of actuarial losses the decrease was partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality assumptions special items of 58 included 55 for pension settlement losses and 3 for special termination benefits a portion of which relates to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan 

2016 outlook 

in 2016 we will change the method utilized to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for our major defined benefit pension plans historically we estimated the service cost and interest cost components using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we will elect to use a spot rate approach for our major plans in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs we consider this a change in estimate and accordingly will account for it prospectively starting in 2016 this change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligation 

in 2015 we adopted the society of actuaries new mortality tables for the us supplementary pension plan when we remeasured the plan due to pension settlements and curtailment in 2016 we will adopt the new mortality tables for all major plans 

in 2016 pension expense is estimated to be approximately 80 to 100 excluding special items which would be flat to down versus 2015 and results from a reduction of the service cost and interest cost from adoption of the spot rate approach defined above and the impact of the expected return on plan assets partially offset by adoption of the new mortality tables pension settlement losses of 10 to 20 are expected dependent on the timing of retirements in 2016 we expect pension expense to include approximately 125 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to 120 in 2015 net actuarial losses of 431 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2015 primarily attributable to lower than expected actual returns on plan assets improved mortality projections and lower discount rates actuarial gainslosses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gainslosses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2016 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of third party actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2015 and 2014 our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 1375 and 782 respectively 

for 2016 cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 100 to 120 the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans which are dependent upon the timing of retirements and future cost reduction actions actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 42 for a projection of future contributions 

 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 283 351 and 371 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine we estimate that we spent 4 and 5 in 2015 and 2014 respectively on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately 4 in both 2016 and 2017 

we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 80 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 93 as of 30 september 2015 the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2015 and 2014 included an accrual of 806 and 862 respectively the accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the pace florida piedmont south carolina and pasadena texas locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme and california’s cap and trade scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario canada china and south korea in addition the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities at the us state level california’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began 1 january 2013 we have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms 

increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the longterm impact on us any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen one of our main products and our proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating in the industrial gas business during the third quarter of 2015 we entered into a longterm sale of equipment contract to engineer procure and construct industrial gas facilities for our 25 owned joint venture to serve saudi aramco’s jazan oil refinery and power plant in saudi arabia the principal terms of the agreement are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party sales related to this contract are included in the results of our industrial gases – global segment and were not material during fiscal year 2015 

inflation 

we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2015 totaled 96369 and depreciation expense totaled 9004 during 2015 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

the regional industrial gases segments have numerous longterm customer supply contracts for which we construct an onsite plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset 

our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and for smaller customers packaged gases the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years the depreciable lives of production facilities within the materials technologies segment where there is not an associated longterm supply agreement range from 10 to 15 years these depreciable lives 

 

have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional industrial gases segments and materials technologies segment would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 

 impairment of assets 

plant and equipment 

plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the longlived asset a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges in 2014 we tested the recoverability of latin america longlived assets and concluded they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows 

in 2015 due to continued technical challenges onstream delays and additional capital costs for the two projects associated with our energyfromwaste segment that are under construction in tees valley united kingdom the company evaluated different scenarios using undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine whether an indication of impairment exists factors specific to this asset grouping include estimating longterm efficiency output and onstream reliability of the projects the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows of the asset group exceeded the carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated in november 2015 the company suspended construction of the second project until certain design issues of the first project are understood remediated and can be efficiently integrated into the design of the second project it is reasonably possible that key assumptions or actual conditions may change and result in a future impairment charge 

goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity goodwill was 11313 as of 30 september 2015 disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10 goodwill to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for more frequent testing as a result of our reorganization effective 1 october 2014 we also reviewed goodwill for impairment in the first quarter of 2015 as further discussed below the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly as of 30 september 2015 we had seven business segments and thirteen reporting units reporting units are primarily based on products within each business segment the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the three regional industrial gases segments and the materials technologies segment 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a twostep quantitative test is required we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing as further described below 

the first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value including assigned goodwill to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we initially use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of estimated future cash flows our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capitalintensive nature the longterm contractual nature of our business and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates operating profit margins discount rate and exit multiple projected revenue growth rates and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate reflects expected longterm growth rates if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment when the market approach is utilized fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects when both the income and market approach are utilized we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in an analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

in 2014 we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing as of 1 july 2014 and concluded that the goodwill associated with the latin america reporting unit previously within the merchant gases segment was impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 3052 the latin america reporting unit is composed predominately of our indura business with business units in chile colombia and other latin america countries which the company acquired in 2012 

the acquisition price in 2012 reflected the company’s expectations for indura’s revenue growth in chile and across latin america at the time of the acquisition the indura business had approximately 480 in revenue and 21 ebitda margin we anticipated average revenue to grow at a multiple of up to two times longterm manufacturing growth which was projected at approximately 4 in addition we expected additional revenue growth from the company’s ability to fund increased onsite plant investment and its application technology capability we also expected ebitda margins to expand based on production distribution supply chain and overhead synergies revenue growth was also anticipated to drive expanding ebitda margins and increase future cash flows 

 

in 2014 economic conditions impacting our latin america reporting unit began to weaken including a decline in chilean manufacturing growth increasing inflation weaker export demand for many commodities and the enactment of higher tax rates in chile while we achieved expected cost synergies for the indura business we did not realize projected revenue growth primarily due to the weakening chilean economy additionally longterm manufacturing growth forecasts were reduced to 2 to 3 in chile and other countries in which indura operates as a result of these events we had lowered our growth projections to be in line with lower published growth rates reduced our expectations for ebitda margin expansion by approximately 600 basis points and determined that the associated goodwill was impaired 

in 2014 we conducted an additional impairment test on our reporting units that existed as of 30 september 2014 due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 october 2014 the fair value of all of the reporting units except latin america substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 september 2014 the fair value of our latin america reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 the fair value of the latin america reporting unit was estimated based on a similar outlook and assumptions as those used for the 1 july 2014 testing and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value primarily due to depreciation and amortization and the 206 impact of the chilean tax rate change 

during the first quarter of 2015 we conducted an impairment test based on our new reporting structure as of 1 october 2014 we determined that the fair value of all of our new reporting units except latin america substantially exceeded their carrying value and therefore there were no indications of impairment the latin america reporting unit now within the industrial gases – americas segment did not change as a result of the reorganization and its fair value was based on a similar longterm outlook and assumptions as those used in the 2014 impairment testing 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing noting no indications of impairment the fair value of all of our reporting units except for our latin america reporting unit continued to substantially exceed their carrying value the fair value of our latin america reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 

the excess of fair value over carrying value for our other reporting units ranged from approximately 70 to approximately 250 management judgement is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of these reporting units in this scenario the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 50 to 220 

as of 30 september 2015 the carrying value of the latin america goodwill was 2009 or approximately 1 of consolidated total assets the reporting unit represents approximately 5 of the company’s total consolidated sales revenue growth and ebitda margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value of our latin america reporting unit and these assumptions are underpinned by our expectations for longterm manufacturing growth in the region in the event of further declines in longterm manufacturing growth projections we may need to perform additional impairment analysis we determined that with other assumptions held constant a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 300 basis points or a decrease in ebitda margins of approximately 200 basis points would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being equal to its carrying value which would require that we perform step 2 of the impairment analysis to assess the need for additional goodwill impairment 

the latin america reporting unit has other material assets that include plant and equipment net of 3635 customer relationships of 1725 and trade names and trademarks of 601 the trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets see impairment considerations for these assets within the plant and equipment and intangible assets sections of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include but are not limited to longerterm economic weakness decline in market share pricing pressures inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures increases to our cost of capital and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses negative changes in one or more of these factors among others could result in additional impairment charges 

we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results or changes in management’s business outlook or strategy 

 

intangible assets 

intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 september 2015 totaled 4482 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2015 totaled 601 and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss to determine fair value we utilize the royalty savings method a form of the income approach this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we conducted our annual impairment test and determined that our indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired refer to note 11 intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangibles and found no indications of impairment 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 12657 at 30 september 2015 the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8 summarized financial information of equity affiliates to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary an impairment loss would be recognized management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate at 30 september 2015 accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to 558 and 7207 respectively tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2015 were 975 excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2015 was 4159 disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 23 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include 

 

forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in our effective tax rate would decreaseincrease net income by approximately 17 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the domestic and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover in fiscal year 2015 our mortality assumptions were aligned with the irs mortality assumption used to determine funding valuations with the exception of the us supplementary pension plan in which we adopted the society of actuaries new mortality tables upon remeasurement of the plan required as a result of pension settlements and curtailments in 2015 as of 30 september 2015 our projected benefit obligation reflects the adoption of the society of actuaries new mortality tables for all major plans our mortality assumptions will differ from the irs mortality assumptions used to determine funding valuations as the irs is not expected to adopt the new tables until 2017 

one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of highquality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date this rate will change from yeartoyear based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 31 per year 

effective in fiscal year 2016 we will use a spot rate approach to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for most of our defined benefit pension plans 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated longterm returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets in determining estimated asset class returns we take into account historical and future expected longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 19 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets for equities this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur and reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 14 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies ie situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and particulars are provided in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased or our proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1 major accounting policies and note 13 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 14 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 

at 30 september 2015 and 2014 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 44520 and 50449 respectively the decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to repayment of longterm debt and a stronger us dollar which reduced the translated value of foreign currency debt and increased the fair value of our outstanding derivatives 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2015 including the effect of currency swap agreements primarily comprised debt denominated in us dollars 46 and euros 23 this debt portfolio is composed of 48 fixedrate debt and 52 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

the sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2015 with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 139 and 173 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2015 and 2014 respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 151 and 188 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2015 and 2014 respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 30 and 31 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2015 and 2014 respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 30 and 31 per year at 30 september 2015 and 2014 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2015 and 2014 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 421 and 419 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2015 and 2014 respectively 

 

the primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are euros and us dollars euros and british pound sterling and british pound sterling and us dollars foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

the majority of the company’s sales are derived from outside of the united states and denominated in foreign currencies financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the euro represents the largest exposure in terms of our foreign earnings we estimate that a 10 reduction in the euro versus the us dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 20

narrative description of business by segments 

merchant gases 

merchant gases provides atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air process gases such as hydrogen helium purchased or refined from crude helium and carbon dioxide specialty gases temporary gas supply services and equipment throughout the world to customers in diversified industries including metals glass electronics chemical processing food processing healthcare general manufacturing and petroleum and natural gas industries 

merchant gases supplies the following types of products 

liquid bulk —product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases —small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states the company’s packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries 

small onsite plants —customers receive product through small onsites cryogenic or noncryogenic generators either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer 

electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases—oxygen nitrogen and argon natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the company’s merchant gases facilities the company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through pricing formulas and surcharges helium is primarily produced as a byproduct of natural gas production we purchase crude helium for purification and resale during fiscal year 2014 we experienced shortages in helium supply due to industrywide sourcing shortfalls and the supplydemand dynamics in this product continue to evolve no other significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials during the year 

merchant gases competes worldwide against three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc and several regional sellers including airgas inc primarily with respect to liquid bulk sales competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications 

merchant gases sales constituted 41 of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014 40 in fiscal year 2013 and 38 in fiscal year 2012 sales of atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen and argon via the liquid bulk packaged gases 

  

and small onsite plants supply modes constituted approximately 49 of the merchant gases segment in fiscal year 2014 48 in fiscal year 2013 and 54 in fiscal year 2012 these sales constituted approximately 20 of the total company consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014 19 in fiscal year 2013 and 21 in fiscal year 2012 

the company owns a 673 controlling interest in the outstanding shares of indura sa an industrial gas company in south america which produces packaged and liquid bulk gases and sells related hard goods indura sa is accounted for as part of the merchant gases operating segment the merchant gases segment also includes the company’s share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method the largest of these joint ventures operate in mexico italy south africa saudi arabia india and thailand 

tonnage gases 

tonnage gases provides hydrogen carbon monoxide nitrogen oxygen and syngas a hydrogencarbon monoxide mixture principally to the energy production and refining chemical and metallurgical industries worldwide gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by contracts with 15 to 20 year terms the company is the world’s largest provider of hydrogen which is used by oil refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels to reduce smog and ozone depletion the energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification the metallurgical industry uses nitrogen for inerting and oxygen for the manufacture of steel and certain nonferrous metals the chemical industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals the company delivers product through pipelines from centrally located facilities in or near the united states gulf coast los angeles california alberta canada rotterdam the netherlands the united kingdom western belgium ulsan korea nanjing china tangshan china kuan yin taiwan and singapore the company also owns less than controlling interests in pipelines located in thailand and south africa 

natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas production electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases the company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through longterm cost passthrough provisions in its contracts during fiscal year 2014 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas however we experienced interruptions in availability of syngas which affected our hydrogen and carbon monoxide sales in the united states gulf coast 

tonnage gases competes against three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag praxair inc and several regional competitors competition is based primarily on price reliability of supply the development of applications that use industrial gases and in some cases provision of other services or products such as power and steam generation we also have a competitive advantage in regions where we have pipeline networks which enable us to provide a reliable and economic supply of products to customers 

tonnage gases sales constituted approximately 32 of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014 33 in fiscal year 2013 and 33 in fiscal year 2012 sales of hydrogen and related products constituted approximately 68 of the tonnage gases segment in fiscal year 2014 62 in fiscal year 2013 and 57 in fiscal year 2012 these sales constituted approximately 22 of the total company consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014 21 in fiscal year 2013 and 19 in fiscal year 2012

steel aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents compressors etc are the principal raw materials in the construction of equipment in this business segment adequate raw materials for individual projects are acquired under firm purchase agreements the company mitigates these cost components in part through longterm cost passthrough provisions in contracts during fiscal year 2014 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials 

equipment and energy competes with a great number of firms for all of its offerings except lng heat exchangers for which there are fewer competitors due to the limited market size and proprietary technologies competition is based primarily on technological performance service technical knowhow price and performance guarantees 

the backlog of equipment orders including letters of intent believed to be firm from thirdparty customers was approximately 520 million on 30 september 2014 approximately 12 of which is for cryogenic equipment and 75 of which is for lng heat exchangers as compared with a total backlog of approximately 402 million on 30 september 2013 the company expects that approximately 320 million of the backlog on 30 september 2014 will be completed during fiscal year 2015

 item 1a risk factors   tableend in conjunction with evaluating an investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should carefully read the following risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

overall economic and supplydemand conditions—a weakening or reversal of economic recovery or product supply versus demand imbalance in certain markets in which the company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues operating results and cash flow 

demand for the company’s products and services depend in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business in the past few years uncertain economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in markets served by the company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings helium is an example of a market experiencing changes in global supply and demand unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility impact new project onstream timing or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment 

reorganization—our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results 

the board of directors recently elected a new chairman president and chief executive officer who has implemented other senior leadership changes and refocused our strategic goals we have begun and will continue to execute a number of significant business and organization changes to support our new strategic objectives we expect these changes which may include staffing adjustments and reassignment of responsibilities as well as employee departures to continue for the foreseeable future successfully managing these changes including successfully transitioning and stabilizing key business and functional processes is critical to our business success failure or delay in transitioning key processes could result in disruptions to our business 

operational political and legal risks of international operations—the company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability developing market operations present special risks 

the majority of the company’s revenue is derived from international operations in addition the company is actively investing significant capital and other resources in emerging markets the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to project delays due to unanticipated government actions and to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions social unrest or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition results of operation and cash flow 

our developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including geopolitical legal economic and talent risks our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market including unfamiliar regulatory environments new relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets 

  

interest rate increases—the company’s earnings cash flow and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases and access to credit 

at 30 september 2014 the company had total consolidated debt of 61185 million of which 16729 million will mature in the next twelve months the company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt although the company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates if interest rates increase the company’s interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes in addition changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing and weaken our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us for a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk see item 7a below 

new technologies—new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

a number of new technologies and new product offerings are being developed or implemented by the company some of our existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation in particular the company’s tees valley projects contain some processes that have not been demonstrated to date at the same scale or in the same combination and although such projects include processes that have been demonstrated previously by others such processes are new to the company 

raw material and energy cost and availability—interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the company’s business because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent the company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results 

the company’s supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production which may result from natural gas pricing or supplier operating issues or interruptions in sales from other crude helium suppliers can reduce the company’s supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to its customers 

the electronics and performance materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials including alcohols ethyleneamines cyclohexylamine acrylonitriles and glycols shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results 

the company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results the company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

regulatory compliance—the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact the company’s financial condition results of operation and cash flow 

the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business the application of laws and regulations to the company’s business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in 

  

reduced profitability determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so export restrictions continue to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the company’s businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject the company to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs we have internal control policies and procedures to foster compliance with these laws including compliance and training programs for our employees and established due diligence procedures with regard to third parties however the foregoing cannot eliminate the risk that violations could be committed by our employees agents or joint venture partners 

greenhouse gases—legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme california’s cap and trade scheme alberta’s emission reduction program and china’s emission trading scheme pilots and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario canada south korea and china in addition the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities moreover some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector eg chile’s tax on carbon dioxide from power producers to motivate emission reductions these reductions often involve higher power costs 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase the company’s costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could impact the company’s growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products 

environmental compliance—costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” above 

we may not be able to successfully control or reduce costs to improve productivity and streamline operations 

achieving our longterm profitability and return goals depends significantly on our efforts to control or reduce our operating costs because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency if we are not able to identify and execute efforts designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency our financial results could be adversely impacted 

currency fluctuations—changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

the majority of the company’s sales are derived from outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies the company also has significant production facilities that are located outside of the united states financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects but it is not costeffective to hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that 

  

would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a below 

catastrophic events—catastrophic events could disrupt the company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the company’s business financial results and cash flow 

the company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the company’s control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes and storms epidemics or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact the company’s suppliers or customers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the company’s products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

operational risks—operational and execution risks may adversely affect the company’s operations or financial results 

the company’s operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the company’s ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flow in addition the company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements which depends in part on the company’s ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets operating results are also dependent on the company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements which depends in part on the availability of adequate sources of labor in the geographies where the company intends to build new plants failure to do so may expose the company to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

information security—the security of the company’s information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and outsourced service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information through a security breach as with all large systems our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes the company’s systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to sophisticated cyber security threats to date the company is not aware of any impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business involves the use storage and transmission of information about its employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as the company’s information is critical to the company the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements the company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information the company also from time to time exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

  

litigation and regulatory proceedings—the company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material while the company seeks to limit its liability in its commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable at law also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flow in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company see item 3 below 

asset impairments—the company may be required to record impairment on its longlived assets 

weak demand may cause underutilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines contract terminations customer shutdowns or customer default may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or projects not to reach onstream and contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on its financial results 

competition—inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of its business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the company’s products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could affect the company’s profitability or its market share 

pension liabilities—the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its pension plans 

adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities significantly affecting the net periodic benefit costs of its pension plans and ongoing funding requirements for these plans as a result the company’s financial results and cash flow in any period could be negatively impacted for information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters see the discussion in note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below

 item 3 legal proceedings   tableend in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including contract product liability intellectual property and insurance matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

the company is a party to proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are approximately 36 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current or former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these matters would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 73 million at 30 september 2014 on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts on 6 may 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against air products brasil ltda was dismissed cade has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these or any other legal proceeding would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or net cash flows a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

investing activities 

for the year ended 30 september 2014 cash used for investing activities was 16380 primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment for the year ended 30 september 2013 cash used for investing activities was 16970 primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment and acquisitions for the year ended 30 september 2012 cash used for investing activities was 24352 primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates refer to the capital expenditures section below for additional detail 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures are detailed in the following table 

 

  

 capital expenditures on a gaap basis in 2014 totaled 16822 compared to 17478 in 2013 the decrease of 656 was primarily due to the acquisitions in 2013 additions to plant and equipment are largely in support of the merchant gases and tonnage gases businesses additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine ongoing nature including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements spending in 2014 and 2013 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification in china hydrogen to the global market and renewable energy in the uk 

in 2013 we completed three acquisitions with an aggregate cash use net of cash acquired of 2249 in the fourth quarter we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in guiyang china during the third quarter we acquired epco the largest independent us producer of liquid carbon dioxide co 2  and wcg 

in 2012 we acquired a controlling stake in indura sa for 690 and ei dupont de nemours and co inc’s 50 interest in our joint venture da nanomaterials for 147 we also purchased a 25 equity interest in abdullah hashim industrial gases  equipment co ltd ahg an unconsolidated affiliate for 155 

refer to note 5 business combinations and note 7 summarized financial information of equity affiliates to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisitions and the investments 

capital expenditures on a nongaap basis in 2014 totaled 18851 compared to 19967 in 2013 capital lease expenditures of 2024 decreased by 325 reflecting lower project spending 

2015 outlook 

excluding acquisitions capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2015 on a gaap basis are expected to be between 1650 and 1800 and on a nongaap basis are expected to be between 1700 and 1900 the nongaap capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases which are expected to be between 50 and 100 a majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations in addition we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates 

financing activities 

for the year ended 2014 cash used by financing activities was 5043 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of 6277 which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of 1416 our borrowings short and longterm proceeds net of repayments were a net source of cash issuance of 11 and included 1487 of net commercial paper and other shortterm debt issuances debt proceeds from the issuance of a 

  

400 senior fixedrate 335 note on 31 july 2014 and 610 of other primarily international debt issuances and debt repayments of a 375 eurobond of € 300 million 4010 in november 2013 and 2076 of other primarily international debt

for the year ended 2012 cash used for financing activities was 784 our borrowings short and longterm proceeds net of repayments were a net source of cash issuance of 4196 and included the issuances of a 4000 senior fixedrate 30 note on 3 november 2011 and a 4000 senior fixedrate 12 note on 13 september 2012 which were partially offset by the repayment of a 425 eurobond of 4003 on 10 april 2012 proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional 1243 source of funds dividends paid to shareholders were a use of cash of 5149 

discontinued operations 

for the year ended 2014 cash used by discontinued operations was 1466 and primarily included a payment made to the linde group for contingent proceeds we were obligated to return from the sale of our homecare business for the year ended 2013 cash provided by discontinued operations was 131 for the year ended 2012 the sale of our european homecare business to the linde group generated proceeds of 7766 and included the contingent proceeds that we returned in 2014 refer to note 3 discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financing and capital structure 

capital needs in 2014 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations at the end of 2014 total debt outstanding was 61185 compared to 62736 at the end of 2013 and cash and cash items were 3366 compared to 4504 at the end of 2013 total debt at 30 september 2014 and 2013 expressed as a percentage of total capitalization total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest was 439 and 453 respectively 

proceeds from longterm debt were 4610 this included the issuance of a 4000 senior fixedrate 335 note on 31 july 2014 that matures on 31 july 2024 which was issued for general corporate purposes refer to note 14 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 25000 revolving credit agreement maturing 30 april 2018 with a syndicate of banks the “2013 credit agreement” under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries effective 30 june 2014 the 2013 credit agreement was amended to increase the facility to 25950 the 2013 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity for the company and supports its commercial paper program this credit facility includes a financial covenant for a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest no greater than 70 no borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement as of 30 september 2014 

effective 11 june 2012 we entered into an offshore chinese renminbi rmb syndicated credit facility of rmb10000 million 1609 that was to mature in june 2015 on 20 march 2014 we repaid the outstanding balance of rmb2500 million 402 and terminated the credit facility additional commitments totaling 1897 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries of which 1806 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2014 

as of 30 september 2014 we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 

as of 30 september 2014 we classified our 3875 eurobond of € 300 million 3789 maturing in march 2015 as longterm debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under the 2013 credit agreement our current intent is to refinance this debt via the us or european public or private placement markets 

on 15 september 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 of our outstanding common stock during fiscal year 2013 57 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of 4616 we did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal year 2014 at 30 september 2014 4853 in share repurchase authorization remains 

  

2015 outlook 

cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we project a modest need to access the longterm debt markets in 2015 primarily to refinance maturing longterm debt we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants also we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other shortterm debt markets 

dividends 

dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter during 2014 the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from 71 per share to 77 per share on 17 july 2014 the board of directors declared the fourth quarter dividend which is payable on 10 november 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 1 october 2014 

contractual obligations 

we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations the following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 september 2014 

 

 longterm debt obligations 

the longterm debt obligations include the maturity payments of longterm debt including current portion and the related contractual interest obligations refer to note 14 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on longterm debt 

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the longterm debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest we had 1168 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2014 excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2014 variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates 

leases 

refer to note 11 leases to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities refer to note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

unconditional purchase obligations 

approximately 650 of our longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts we do not believe these 

  

purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations 

the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations which are primarily passthrough contracts with our customers in addition purchase commitments to spend approximately 700 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2015 

we also purchase materials energy capital equipment supplies and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy which are obtained under requirementstype contracts at market prices 

income tax liabilities 

noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 september 2014 were 9955 tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2014 were 1087 these tax liabilities were excluded from the contractual obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws tax rates and our operating results in addition there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities refer to note 22 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

put options 

we have an outstanding put option agreement with the largest minority shareholder of our indura sa subsidiary the put option gives the shareholder the ability to require us to purchase up to a 305 equity interest during the twoyear period beginning on 1 july 2015 based on pricing terms in the agreement refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we anticipate that this option will be exercised sometime during the twoyear period however given the uncertainty in timing of exercise we have excluded the payment from the contractual obligations table as of 30 september 2014 the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is 2872 

pension benefits 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans—the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans over the long run the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

for 2014 the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to 41146 from 38008 in 2013 the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was 47386 and 43940 in 2014 and 2013 respectively refer to note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

pension expense 

 

 2014 vs 2013 

the decrease in pension expense excluding special items was primarily attributable to the 60 bp increase in weighted average discount rate resulting in lower amortization of actuarial losses the decrease was partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality assumptions special items of 58 primarily included 55 for pension settlement losses and 3 for special termination benefits a portion of which relates to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan 

2013 vs 2012 

the increase in pension expense excluding special items was primarily attributable to the 100 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses the increase was partially offset 

  

by a higher than expected return on plan assets and contributions in 2013 special items of 198 primarily included 124 for pension settlement losses and 69 for special termination benefits relating to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan 

2015 outlook 

pension expense is estimated to be approximately 110 to 115 excluding special items in 2015 a decrease of 15 to 20 from 2014 resulting primarily from favorable asset experience partially offset by a decrease in discount rates pension settlement losses of 25 to 35 are expected dependent on the timing of retirements in 2015 we expect pension expense to include approximately 123 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to 114 in 2014 net actuarial losses of 104 were recognized in 2014 resulting primarily from an approximately 60 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate partially offset by actual asset returns above expected returns actuarial gainslosses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gainslosses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2015 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of third party actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2014 and 2013 our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 782 and 3008 respectively contributions for 2013 included voluntary contributions for us plans of 2200 

for 2015 cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be 130 to 150 the increase from prior year is driven primarily by benefit payments for unfunded plans which are dependent upon the timing of retirements and actions to reorganize the business actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 36 for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 351 371 and 447 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine we estimate that we spent 5 and 4 in 2014 and 2013 respectively on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately 5 in both 2015 and 2016 

we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 86 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 99 as of 30 september 2014 the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2014 and 2013 included an accrual of 862 and 867 respectively the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace florida piedmont south carolina paulsboro new jersey and pasadena texas locations is included in these amounts refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

  

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme and california’s cap and trade scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario canada and south korea in addition the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities at the us state level california’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began 1 january 2013 we have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms 

increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the longterm impact on us any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen one of our main products and our proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business we did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties 

inflation 

we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2014 totaled 95321 and depreciation expense totaled 9148 during 2014 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

  

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

we have numerous longterm customer supply contracts particularly in the gases onsite business within the tonnage gases segment these contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years there are also longterm customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment these contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years additionally we have several customer supply contracts within the equipment and energy segment with contract terms that are primarily five to 10 years the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the physical life of the asset 

the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally 15 years customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment where there is not an associated longterm supply agreement range from 10 to 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated longterm customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 

 

 impairment of assets 

plant and equipment 

plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing 

  

impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

we tested the recoverability of latin america longlived assets and concluded that they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows 

goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity goodwill was 12373 as of 30 september 2014 disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 9 goodwill to the consolidated financial statements 

we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly as of 30 september 2014 we had four business segments and thirteen reporting units reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a twostep quantitative test is required we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing as further described below 

the first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value including assigned goodwill to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we initially use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of estimated future cash flows our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capitalintensive nature the longterm contractual nature of our business and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates operating profit margins discount rate and exit multiple projected revenue growth rates and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate reflects expected longterm growth rates if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment when the market approach is utilized fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects when both the income and market approach are utilized we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in an analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter other than our latin america reporting unit within the merchant gases segment we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore there were no indications of impairment the latin america reporting unit is composed predominately of our indura business with assets and goodwill associated with operations in chile and other latin american countries recently economic conditions in latin america including 

  

the impact of tax legislation in chile have been less favorable due to increasing inflation a decline in chilean manufacturing growth and weaker export demand for many commodities as a result we lowered growth projections for our latin america reporting unit and determined that the associated goodwill was impaired in the fourth quarter we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 3052 refer to note 9 goodwill to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other than latin america the excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units ranged from approximately 35 to approximately 175 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of these reporting units in this scenario the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 20 to 150 

due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 october 2014 we conducted an additional impairment test on our existing reporting units as of 30 september 2014 the fair value of all of our reporting units except latin america substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 september 2014 the fair value of the latin america reporting unit at 30 september was estimated based on a similar outlook and assumptions as those used for the 1 july 2014 testing and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value due primarily to depreciation and amortization and the impact of the chilean tax rate change as of 30 september 2014 the carrying value of latin america goodwill was 2327 if economic conditions in the latin america operating environment deteriorate further or the business fails to perform as expected an additional review of goodwill recoverability may be warranted 

future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include but are not limited to decline in market share pricing pressures inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures increases to our cost of capital and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses negative changes in one or more of these factors among others could result in additional impairment charges 

we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results or changes in management’s business outlook or strategy we will conduct goodwill impairment testing in the first quarter of 2015 under our new reporting structure 

intangible assets 

intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 september 2014 totaled 5412 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2014 totaled 746 and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss to determine fair value we utilize the royalty savings method a form of the income approach this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we conducted our annual impairment test and determined that our indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired refer to note 10 intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 12579 at 30 september 2014 the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 7 summarized financial information of equity affiliates to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary an impairment loss would be recognized management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is 

  

based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate at 30 september 2014 accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to 780 and 8061 respectively tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2014 were 1087 excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2014 was 3660 disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 22 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in our effective tax rate would decreaseincrease net income by approximately 14 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the domestic and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover our mortality assumptions are currently aligned with the irs mortality assumption used to determine funding valuations in october 2014 the society of actuaries published new mortality tables while the irs is not expected to adopt the new tables until 2017 we have begun to evaluate the potential impact of these tables on future periods 

one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of highquality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date this rate will change from yeartoyear based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 21 per year 

  

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated longterm returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets in determining asset class returns we take into account historical longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 17 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets which is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur which reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for fixed income investments is the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 5 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies ie situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and particulars are provided in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased or our proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1 major accounting policies and note 12 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 13 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 

at 30 september 2014 and 2013 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 50449 and 57195 respectively the decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to repayment of a 375 eurobond of € 300 million 4010 in november 2013 and a stronger us dollar which reduced the translated value of foreign currency debt 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

  

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of 30 september 2014 including the effect of currency swap agreements primarily comprised debt denominated in us dollars 54 and euros 22 this debt portfolio is composed of 50 fixedrate debt and 50 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

the sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2014 with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 173 and 143 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2014 and 2013 respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 188 and 154 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2014 and 2013 respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 31 and 29 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2014 and 2013 respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 31 and 29 per year at 30 september 2014 and 2013 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2014 and 2013 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 419 and 295 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2014 and 2013 respectively the change in the sensitivity analysis from september 2013 to september 2014 is driven primarily by an increase in the notional amount of intercompany loan currency hedges 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro and the euro versus the pound sterling foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

the majority of the company’s sales are derived from outside of the united states and denominated in foreign currencies financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the euro represents the largest exposure in terms of our foreign earnings we estimate that a 10 reduction in the euro versus the us dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately 20

merchant gases supplies the following types of products 

liquid bulk —product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases —small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states the company’s packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries 

small onsite plants —customers receive product through small onsites cryogenic or noncryogenic generators either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer 

electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases—oxygen nitrogen and argon natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the company’s merchant gases facilities the company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through pricing formulas and surcharges helium is primarily produced as a byproduct of natural gas production we purchase crude helium for purification and resale during fiscal year 2013 we experienced shortages in helium supply due to industrywide sourcing shortfalls no other significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials during the year

 item 1a risk factors   tableend in conjunction with evaluating an investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should carefully read the following risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

overall economic conditions—a weakening or reversal of economic recovery in certain markets in which the company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues operating results and cash flow 

demand for the company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business in the past few years uncertain economic conditions in certain geographies and industries served by the company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment 

operational political and legal risks of international operations—the company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability developing market operations present special risks 

the majority of the company’s revenue is derived from international operations in addition the company is actively investing significant capital and other resources in emerging markets the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to project delays due to unanticipated government actions and to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions social unrest or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

our developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including geopolitical legal economic and talent risks we expect to achieve our longterm financial goals in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions our results could be negatively impacted our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market including unfamiliar regulatory environments new relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets 

interest rate increases—the company’s earnings cash flow and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases and access to credit 

at 30 september 2013 the company had total consolidated debt of 62736 million of which 16173 million will mature in the next twelve months the company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt although the company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates if interest rates increase the company’s interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes in addition changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing and weaken our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us for a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk see item 7a below 

  

new technologies—new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

a number of new technologies and new product offerings are being developed or implemented by the company some of our existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation 

raw material and energy cost and availability—interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the company’s business because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings a disruption in the supply of energy or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent the company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results 

the company’s supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers lower natural gas production which may result from natural gas pricing or supplier operating issues or interruptions in sales from other crude helium suppliers can reduce the company’s supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to its customers 

the electronics and performance materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials including alcohols ethyleneamines cyclohexylamine acrylonitriles and glycols shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results 

the company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results the company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

regulatory compliance—the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business the application of laws and regulations to the company’s business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so export restrictions continue to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the company’s businesses increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and the china antiunfair competition law could subject the company to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs we have internal control policies and procedures to foster compliance with these laws including compliance and training programs for our employees however the foregoing cannot eliminate the risk that violations could be committed by our employees agents or joint venture partners 

greenhouse gases—legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and 

  

mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario canada and south korea in addition the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase the company’s costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could impact the company’s growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products 

environmental compliance—costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” above 

we may not be able to successfully implement initiatives to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

achieving our longterm profitability and return goals depends significantly on our efforts to control or reduce our operating costs because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency or other initiatives such initiatives are important to our success if we are not able to identify and complete initiatives designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date or any future costsavings initiatives do not generate expected cost savings our financial results could be adversely impacted 

currency fluctuations—changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

the majority of the company’s sales are derived from outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies the company also has significant production facilities that are located outside of the united states financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects but it is not costeffective to hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a below 

catastrophic events—catastrophic events could disrupt the company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the company’s business financial results and cash flow 

the company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the company’s control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes and storms or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact the company’s suppliers or customers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the company’s products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

  

operational risks—operational and execution risks may adversely affect the company’s operations or financial results 

the company’s operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the company’s ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flow in addition the company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements operating results are also dependent on the company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements failure to do so may expose the company to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

information security—the security of the company’s information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and outsourced service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our intellectual property through security breach as with all large systems our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes the company’s systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to hacking attempts to date the company is not aware of any impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business involves the use storage and transmission of information about its employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as the company’s information is critical to the company the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements the company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information the company also from time to time exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

litigation and regulatory proceedings—the company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company see item 3 below 

asset impairments—the company may be required to record impairment on its longlived assets 

weak demand may cause underutilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment and contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require the company to record 

  

an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on its financial results 

competition—inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of its business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the company’s products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could materially affect the company’s profitability or its market share 

pension liabilities—the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its pension plans 

adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities significantly affecting the net periodic benefit costs of its pension plans and ongoing funding requirements for these plans as a result the company’s financial results and cash flow in any period could be negatively impacted for information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters see the discussion in note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below

 item 3 legal proceedings   tableend in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including contract product liability intellectual property and insurance matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

the company is a party to proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are approximately 33 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current or former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these matters would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” 

  

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 81 million at 30 september 2013 on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts certain of the company’s defenses if successful could result in the matter being dismissed with no fine against us the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is reasonably possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these or any other legal proceeding would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or net cash flows a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

business overview 

air products and chemicals inc and its subsidiaries serve energy electronics chemicals metals and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products services and solutions that include atmospheric process and specialty gases performance materials equipment and technology geographically diverse with operations in over 50 countries in 2013 we had sales of 102 billion assets of 179 billion and a worldwide workforce of approximately 21600 employees 

we organize our operations into four reportable business segments merchant gases tonnage gases electronics and performance materials and equipment and energy refer to note 25 business segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments 

2013 in summary 

in 2013 we achieved both sales and earnings growth our results did fall short of the expectations we set at the beginning of the year as a result of slower than expected global economic growth global manufacturing grew approximately 2 for the year and limited the opportunities for growth particularly in our europe and asia merchant gases and electronics businesses overall sales increased by 6 resulting from acquisitions and higher energy cost passthrough our underlying sales were 1 higher on strength in our tonnage gases businesses higher performance materials volumes and lng equipment activity partially offset by weakness in our electronics equipment area the impact from winding down our pui business decreased underlying sales by 2 our operating income and diluted earnings per share both increased 2 versus the prior year 

while the difficult global economic environment persisted we took actions to offset this weakness and to improve results in the future we delivered significant cost savings from the 2012 european focused reorganization and committed to additional actions aimed at reducing costs through product exits and asset rationalizations as well as organizational improvements the additional actions are focused on improving our electronics business restructuring our global operations function and further optimizing our cost structure in europe finally we remain on track to exit our pui business in fiscal year 2014 as we continue to manage our business portfolio

our 2014 outlook for global economic growth is modest with a range from 2–4 we expect that the us will grow 2–4 as it continues to face unresolved fiscal challenges weak job growth low consumer confidence and lower global demand we are hopeful that an economic recovery will begin in europe with growth of 0–2 in asia we expect a gradual acceleration in growth particularly in china of 5–7 in south america we expect growth of 1–3 which is largely dependent on global demand driving exports 

we anticipate higher earnings in 2014 from new plant onstreams higher lng activity and volume loading on existing assets recognizing that the last factor will be most influenced by the economy pension expense should be lower as a result of higher interest rates these positive impacts will be partially offset by higher maintenance expense and more shares outstanding we also expect lower earnings from the shutdown of our pui business the cost reduction actions implemented in 2012 and 2013 should provide benefits in 2014 and beyond

on 30 april 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 25000 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the “2013 credit agreement” under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries the 2013 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity for the company and supports its commercial paper program we entered into this agreement to increase the previously existing facility by 3300 extend the maturity date to 30 april 2018 and modify the financial covenant the company’s only financial covenant is a 

  

maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization of 70 no borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement as of 30 september 2013 

the 2013 credit agreement terminates and replaces the company’s 21700 revolving credit agreement dated 8 july 2010 as subsequently amended which was to mature 30 june 2015 and had a financial covenant of longterm debt divided by the sum of longterm debt plus equity of no greater than 60 no borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement at the time of its termination and no early termination penalties were incurred 

effective 11 june 2012 we entered into an offshore chinese renminbi rmb syndicated credit facility of rmb10000 million 1635 maturing in june 2015 there are rmb2500 million 409 in outstanding borrowings under this commitment at 30 september 2013 additional commitments totaling 3830 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries of which 3090 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2013 

an acquisition financing facility was arranged with banco santander chile to provide the initial financing required for the indura sa business combination this was a chilean peso clp committed credit facility with a total commitment amount of clp390 billion 778 of this facility clp347 billion 693 was drawn on 3 july 2012 to fund the business combination and related expenses and the balance of the commitment was cancelled this facility was fully repaid on 2 august 2012 primarily with proceeds from us commercial paper issuance a portion of this commercial paper was subsequently refinanced with the 4000 senior fixedrate 12 note issued on 13 september 2012 that matures on 15 october 2017 

as of 30 september 2013 we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 

as of 30 september 2013 we classified 4000 of commercial paper as longterm debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under our 25000 committed credit facility maturing in 2018 our current intent is to refinance this debt via the us public or private placement markets 

on 15 september 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 of our outstanding common stock during fiscal year 2013 57 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of 4616 at 30 september 2013 4853 in share repurchase authorization remains 

2014 outlook 

cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we project a modest need to access the longterm debt markets in 2014 primarily to refinance commercial paper we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants also we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other shortterm debt markets 

dividends 

on 21 march 2013 the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from 64 per share to 71 per share dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter 

contractual obligations 

we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations the following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 september 2013 

 

   

longterm debt obligations 

the longterm debt obligations include the maturity payments of longterm debt including current portion and the related contractual interest obligations refer to note 15 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on longterm debt 

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the longterm debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest we had 1454 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2013 excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2013 variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates 

leases 

refer to note 12 leases to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities refer to note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

unconditional purchase obligations 

approximately 700 of our longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations 

the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations which are primarily passthrough contracts with our customers in addition purchase commitments to spend approximately 625 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2014 

we also purchase materials energy capital equipment supplies and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy which are obtained under requirementstype contracts at market prices in total we purchase approximately 77 billion annually including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 

income tax liabilities 

noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 september 2013 were 8272 tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2013 were 1243 these tax liabilities were excluded from the contractual obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws tax rates and our operating results in addition there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities refer to note 22 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

discontinued operations 

payables and accrued liabilities as of 30 september 2013 include 148 for the contingent proceeds related to the sale of our homecare business refer to note 3 discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

put options 

we currently have outstanding put option agreements with other shareholders of our air products san fu company ltd and indura sa subsidiaries the put options give the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing we excluded the potential payments from the contractual obligations table 

pension benefits 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans—the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans over the long run the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

for 2013 the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to 38008 from 32391 in 2012 the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was 43940 and 44865 in 2013 and 2012 respectively refer to note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

pension expense 

 

 2013 vs 2012 

the increase in pension expense excluding special items was primarily attributable to the 100 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and contributions in 2013 special items of 198 primarily included 124 for pension settlement losses and 69 for special termination benefits relating to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan 

2012 vs 2011 

pension expense in 2012 excluding special items was comparable to 2011 expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year 

2014 outlook 

pension expense is estimated to be approximately 140 to 145 excluding special items in 2014 a decrease of 5 to 10 from 2013 resulting primarily from an increase in discount rates partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality and inflation assumptions pension settlement losses of 10 to 25 are expected dependent on the timing of retirements in 2014 pension expense will include approximately 118 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to 143 in 2013 net actuarial gains of 3704 were recognized in 2013 resulting primarily from an approximately 65 bp increase in the weighted average discount rate as well as actual asset returns above expected returns actuarial gainslosses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gainslosses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2014 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are primarily nonqualified plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions with the assistance of third party actuaries we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2013 and 2012 our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 3008 and 764 respectively contributions for 2013 include voluntary contributions for us plans of 2200 

  

for 2014 cash contributions to defined benefit plans including benefit payments for unfunded plans are estimated to be 80 to 100 contributions to unfunded plans are dependent upon the timing of retirements actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 34 for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs in the normal course of business we are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the federal superfund law resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 371 447 and 340 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine we estimate that we spent 4 in both 2013 and 2012 on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately 4 in both 2014 and 2015 

we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 86 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 100 the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2013 and 2012 included an accrual of 867 and 875 respectively the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace florida piedmont south carolina paulsboro new jersey and pasadena texas locations is included in these amounts refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme and california’s cap and trade scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario canada and south korea in addition the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities at the us state level california’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began 1 january 2013 we have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms 

increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the longterm impact on us any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we are also 

  

developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen one of our main products and our proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business we did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties 

inflation 

we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2013 totaled 89740 and depreciation expense totaled 8647 during 2013 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

we have numerous longterm customer supply contracts particularly in the gases onsite business within the tonnage gases segment these contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years there are also longterm customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment these contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years additionally we have several customer supply contracts within the equipment and energy segment with contract terms that are primarily 5 to 10 years the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset 

  

the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally 15 years customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment where there is not an associated longterm supply agreement range from 10 to 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated longterm customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 

 

 impairment of assets 

plant and equipment 

plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity goodwill including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of 1264 was 17802 as of 30 september 2013 the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments goodwill increased in 2013 primarily as a result of the epco and wcg acquisitions in merchant gases during the third quarter disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10 goodwill to the consolidated financial statements 

we perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year in addition goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists the tests are done at the reporting unit level which is defined as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly currently we have four business segments and thirteen reporting units reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment 

as part of the goodwill impairment testing and as permitted under the accounting guidance we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the 

  

initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value additional quantitative testing is required 

the first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value including assigned goodwill to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we primarily use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of future cash flows our valuation model uses a fiveyear growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capitalintensive nature of the business longterm contractual nature of the business relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units and limited comparables within the industry the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate operating profit margins discount rate and exit multiple revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions also the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

if the first step of the quantitative test indicates potential impairment the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill would be compared to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the goodwill was greater than its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recorded 

during 2013 there were no events or changes in circumstances identified that warranted interim goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2013 we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment utilizing the quantitative approach we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore there were no indications of impairment 

intangible assets 

intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 september 2013 totaled 6267 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology and land use rights these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2013 totaled 906 and consisted of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recorded we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible is less than its carrying value prior to performing the additional quantitative testing to determine fair value we utilize an income approach the royalty savings method this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we conducted the required annual impairment test utilizing the quantitative approach and determined that the fair value of each indefinitelived intangible asset exceeded its carrying value 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 11955 at 30 september 2013 the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8 summarized financial information of equity affiliates to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary an impairment loss would be recognized management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee changes in key 

  

assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate at 30 september 2013 accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to 630 and 6627 respectively tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2013 were 1243 excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2013 was 3079 disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 22 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in our effective tax rate would decreaseincrease net income by approximately 14 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the domestic and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of highquality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date this rate will change from yeartoyear based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 30 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated longterm returns of major asset classes and the historical 

  

performance of plan assets in determining asset class returns we take into account historical longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 18 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a marketrelated value of plan assets which is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur which reduces yeartoyear volatility the marketrelated value for fixed income investments is the actual fair value expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 16 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies ie situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and particulars are provided in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased or our proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1 major accounting policies and note 13 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information additionally we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 14 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 

at 30 september 2013 and 2012 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 57195 and 49251 respectively the increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of longterm debt excluding exchange rate impacts the increase in book value was primarily driven by the issuance of a 20 eurobond for € 3000 million 3970 on 7 august 2013 that matures on 7 august 2020 and the classification of 4000 of commercial paper as longterm debt due to our ability and intent to refinance the debt under our 25000 committed credit facility maturing in 2018 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio including swap agreements as of 30 september 2013 primarily comprised debt denominated in us dollars 52 and euros 28 including the effect of currency swaps this debt portfolio is composed of 54 fixedrate debt and 46 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2013 with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 143 and 150 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2013 and 2012 respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 154 and 162 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 29 and 26 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2013 and 2012 respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 29 and 26 per year at 30 september 2013 and 2012 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2013 and 2012 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 295 and 274 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro and the euro versus the pound sterling foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis

narrative description of business by segments 

merchant gases 

merchant gases sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air process gases such as hydrogen and helium purchased or refined from crude helium specialty gases and certain services and equipment throughout the world to customers in many industries including those in metals glass chemical processing food processing healthcare steel general manufacturing and petroleum and natural gas industries 

merchant gases includes the following types of products 

liquid bulk —product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases —small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and latin america in the united states the company’s packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries 

small onsite plants —customers receive product through small onsites cryogenic or noncryogenic generators either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer 

electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases—oxygen nitrogen and argon natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the company’s merchant gases facilities the company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through pricing formulas and surcharges helium is produced as a byproduct of natural gas production we purchase crude helium for purification and resale during fiscal year 2012 

  

we experienced shortages in helium supply due to industrywide sourcing shortfalls no other significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials during the year 

merchant gases competes worldwide against three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc and several regional sellers including airgas inc primarily with respect to liquid bulk sales competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications

 item 1a risk factors   tableend in conjunction with evaluating an investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should carefully read the following risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses 

overall economic conditions—a return of recessionary economic conditions in certain markets in which the company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues operating results and cash flow 

demand for the company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business recently uncertain economic conditions in certain geographies and industries served by the company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment 

asset impairments—the company may be required to record impairment on its longlived assets 

weak demand may cause underutilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment and contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on its financial results 

competition—inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in all of its business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the company’s products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could materially affect the company’s profitability or its market share 

raw material and energy cost and availability—interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

a disruption in the supply of energy and raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent the company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the company’s business because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and synthesis gas helium is a byproduct of natural gas production lower natural gas production due to further deterioration in natural gas prices or other factors such as supplier operating issues could further reduce crude helium available for the company to process for resale to its customers reducing its sales the electronics and performance materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials including alcohols ethyleneamines cyclohexylamine acrylonitriles and glycols shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results 

  

the company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results the company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

regulatory compliance—the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions and taxes can negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business the application of laws and regulations to the company’s business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so this area continues to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the company’s businesses 

greenhouse gases—legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union eu emissions trading scheme ets mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario canada and south korea in addition the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities as of 1 january 2013 the company’s hydrogen production facilities in california and the eu will begin their compliance obligation under california’s ab32 cap and trade program and phase 3 eu ets respectively however these facilities have contractual terms to enable cost recovery 

increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase the company’s costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could impact the company’s growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products 

environmental compliance—costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” above 

foreign operations political and legal risks—the company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability developing market operations present special risks 

the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions social unrest or strained relations between 

  

countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

our developing market operations may be subject to greater political legal and economic risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies we expect to achieve our longterm financial goals in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions our results could be negatively impacted our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market including unfamiliar regulatory environments new relationships with local partners and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets 

we may not be able to successfully implement initiatives to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

achieving our longterm profitability and return goals depends significantly on our efforts to control or reduce our operating costs because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency or other initiatives such initiatives are important to our success if we are not able to identify and complete initiatives designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date or any future costsavings initiatives do not generate expected cost savings our financial results could be adversely impacted 

currency fluctuations—changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

a substantial amount of the company’s sales are derived from outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies the company also has significant production facilities which are located outside of the united states financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects but it is not costeffective to hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a below 

interest rate increases—the company’s earnings cash flow and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases 

at 30 september 2012 the company had total consolidated debt of 52919 million of which 10077 million will mature in the next twelve months the company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt although the company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates if interest rates increase the company’s interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes in addition changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing for a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk see item 7a below 

pension liabilities—the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its pension plans 

adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities significantly affecting the net periodic benefit costs of its pension plans and ongoing funding requirements for these plans as a result the company’s financial results and cash flow in any period could be negatively impacted for information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters see the discussion in note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

catastrophic events—catastrophic events could disrupt the company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the company’s business financial results and cash flow 

the company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the company’s control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes and storms or acts of war and terrorism any 

  

such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact the company’s suppliers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the company’s products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

operational risks—operational and execution risks may adversely affect the company’s operations or financial results 

the company’s operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the company’s ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flow in addition the company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements operating results are also dependent on the company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements failure to do so may expose the company to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

information security—the security of the company’s information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and outsourced service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our intellectual property through security breach as with all large systems our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes the company’s systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to hacking attempts to date the company is not aware of any impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business involves the use storage and transmission of information about its employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as the company’s information is critical to the company the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements the company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information the company also from time to time exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the us breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information could result in litigation and potential liability for us could damage our reputation or could otherwise harm our business 

litigation and regulatory proceedings—the company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company see item 3 below 

  

recruiting and retaining employees—inability to attract retain or develop skilled employees could adversely impact the company’s business 

sustaining and growing the company’s business depends on the recruitment development and retention of qualified employees demographic trends shortages in certain skills and changes in the geographic concentration of global businesses have created more competition for talent the inability to attract develop or retain quality employees could negatively impact the company’s ability to take on new projects and sustain its operations which might adversely affect the company’s operations or its ability to grow 

new technologies—new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation 

a number of new technologies and new product offerings are being developed or implemented in commercial designs by the company some of our existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs beyond our experience base these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation 

acquisitions—the inability to effectively integrate acquisitions could adversely impact the company’s financial position and results of operation 

the company has recently made and expects to continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions integrating an acquired company business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may require significant financial and other resources risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

 foreign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries

 item 3 legal proceedings   tableend in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including contract product liability intellectual property and insurance matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

  

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

the company is a party to proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are approximately 35 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current or former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these matters would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 88 million at 30 september 2012 on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts certain of the company’s defenses if successful could result in the matter being dismissed with no fine against us the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is reasonably possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these or any other legal proceeding would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or net cash flows a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   tableend  

 the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this report all comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated all amounts presented are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap except as noted all amounts are presented in millions of dollars except for share data unless otherwise indicated 

captions such as income from continuing operations attributable to air products net income attributable to air products and diluted earnings per share attributable to air products are simply referred to as “income from continuing operations” “net income” and “diluted earnings per share” throughout this management’s discussion and analysis unless otherwise stated 

the discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to nongaap financial measures in 2012 the nongaap measures exclude the photovoltaic pv market actions charge the polyurethane intermediates pui business actions charge the cost reduction plan charge the customer bankruptcy charge the gain on the previously held equity interest in dupont air products nanomaterials llc da nanomaterials the spanish tax settlement and the spanish tax ruling these nongaap measures exclude the net loss on airgas transaction in 2011 and 2010 the presentation of nongaap measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis the reconciliation of reported gaap results to nongaap measures is presented on pages 2930 

business overview 

air products and chemicals inc and its subsidiaries serve energy electronics chemicals steel and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products services and solutions that include atmospheric process and specialty gases performance materials equipment and technology geographically diverse with operations in over 50 countries we have sales of 96 billion assets of 169 billion and a worldwide workforce of approximately 21300 employees 

we organize our operations into four reportable business segments merchant gases tonnage gases electronics and performance materials and equipment and energy 

2012 in summary 

in 2012 the global economy proved to be more challenging than we expected and we did not see the anticipated economic growth we forecasted for the second half of the fiscal year global manufacturing grew approximately 3 for the year and limited the opportunities for growth particularly in our merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments underlying volume growth was modest and overall sales declined by 1 resulting from a stronger dollar and lower energy cost passthrough partially offset by acquisitions our operating income declined 1 versus the prior year 

in response to the current and forecasted economic environment we took a number of important steps to position our global portfolio for future success in europe we sold our homecare business and implemented a restructuring 

  

program to better align our cost structure with the slower economy we took actions to exit our polyurethane intermediates business and restructured our photovoltaic business to reflect current market conditions additionally we executed on acquisition opportunities to support our growth strategies in the merchant segment we acquired a controlling stake in indura sa the largest independent gas company in latin america we also purchased a 25 position in abdullah hashim industrial gases  equipment co ltd ahg the largest industrial gas company in saudi arabia finally in electronics we purchased the remaining 50 share of our da nanomaterials joint venture 

highlights for 2012 

  

  

  

  

  

 for a discussion of the challenges risks and opportunities on which management is focused refer to our 2013 outlook discussions provided on page 20 in the management’s discussion and analysis that follows 

  

changes in diluted earnings per share attributable to air products 

 2013 outlook 

our 2013 outlook for economic growth is based on the current lack of momentum we have experienced in the second half of 2012 we believe global economic growth in the regions in which we operate will again be modest in 2013 with a range from 2–4 we expect that the us will continue to grow between 2–4 we do not anticipate any meaningful growth in europe in the near future in asia we expect below trend growth from 3–5 as exports to other regions are slow in south america we expect growth of 2–4 

we anticipate higher earnings in 2013 from new plant onstreams and from the loading of existing assets but recognize that this factor will be most influenced by the economy we also anticipate higher earnings from our acquisition of indura sa these gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense as a result of a decline in interest rates we also expect lower earnings in 2013 as a result of restructuring our pui business unfavorable currency impacts and a higher effective tax rate we are focused on increasing productivity and managing costs in this challenging economic environment the cost reduction actions implemented in 2012 should provide benefits in 2013 and beyond

business restructuring and cost reduction plans 

in 2012 we recorded an expense of 3274 2224 aftertax or 103 per share for business restructuring and cost reduction plans in our polyurethane intermediates electronics and european merchant businesses the net loss is reflected on the consolidated income statements as “business restructuring and cost reduction plans” the charges for these plans are excluded from segment operating income 

during the second quarter of 2012 we recorded an expense of 868 606 aftertax or 28 per share for actions to remove stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the homecare business the reorganization of the merchant business and actions we are taking to right size our european cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook this charge includes 808 for severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 600 positions and 60 for the writedown of certain assets the charge relates to the businesses at the segment level as follows 773 in merchant gases 38 in tonnage gases and 57 in electronics and performance materials the planned actions are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 by the end of 2013 we expect these actions to provide approximately 60 in annual savings 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed actions in the polyurethane intermediates pui business to improve costs resulting in a net expense of 546 348 aftertax or 16 per share we sold certain assets and the rights to a supply contract for 327 in cash at closing a supply arrangement with terms at fair market value was established with the buyer to serve the retained product supply contracts so that our pui production facility in pasadena texas could permanently close in connection with these actions we recognized an expense of 266 for the net book value of assets sold and those committed to be disposed of other than by sale the remaining charge was primarily related to contract terminations and an environmental liability the pui facility will be dismantled with completion expected in fiscal year 2013 the costs to dismantle will be expensed as incurred and reflected in continuing operations in the tonnage gases business segment since we will have material ongoing involvement with the business through retained pui product supply contracts the results of this business will continue to be reflected in continuing operations in the tonnage gases segment 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed an assessment of our position in the photovoltaic pv market resulting in 1860 of expense 1270 aftertax or 59 per share primarily related to the electronics and performance materials business segment air products supplies the pv market with both bulk and onsite supply of gases including silane the pv market has not developed as expected and as a result the market capacity to produce silane is expected to exceed demand for the foreseeable future as a result we have entered into negotiations to terminate a longterm takeorpay contract we recorded a charge of 935 for an offer that we made to terminate the contract although a settlement could differ from this amount we do not expect it to be material to our financial position it is uncertain when or if a settlement will be reached the remaining charge was recorded in connection with the expected loss on purchase commitments the disposal of certain assets serving pv and electronics customers the writedown of inventory to its net realizable value and the writedown of accounts receivable

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the longterm debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest we had 1501 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2012 excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2012 variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities refer to note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

unconditional purchase obligations 

approximately 800 of our longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations which are primarily passthrough contracts with our customers we have a supply agreement for the purchase of silane gas that is not matched to a customer sales contract having terms extending to ten years in the fourth quarter of 2012 we made an offer to terminate the contract however no settlement has been reached refer to note 4 business restructuring and cost reduction plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition purchase commitments to spend approximately 592 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2013

discontinued operations 

other noncurrent liabilities as of 30 september 2012 included 141 for the contingent proceeds related to the sale of our homecare business refer to note 3 discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table due to the uncertainty in timing of any payments

we currently have outstanding put option agreements with other shareholders of our air products san fu company ltd and indura sa subsidiaries the put options give the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing we excluded the potential payments from the contractual obligations table 

pension benefits 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans—the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans over the long run the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions

the increase in pension expense net of special items was primarily attributable to the 60 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions in 2011 expense in 2011 included 13 of special termination and settlement charges 

  

2013 outlook 

pension expense is estimated to be approximately 175 to 180 in 2013 an increase of 55 to 60 from 2012 resulting primarily from a decline in discount rates in 2013 pension expense will include approximately 144 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to 960 in 2012 net actuarial losses of 3586 were incurred in 2012 resulting primarily from a 100 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate partially offset by actual asset returns above expected returns actuarial gainslosses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gainslosses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2013 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2012 and 2011 our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 764 and 2410 respectively 

cash contributions to defined benefit plans including benefit payments for unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately 275 in 2013 actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 34 for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs from time to time we are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 447 340 and 316 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws remedial activities and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine we estimate that in 2012 and 2011 we spent approximately 4 and 6 respectively on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately 4 and 5 in 2013 and 2014 respectively 

we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 87 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 101 the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2012 and 2011 included an accrual of 875 and 823 respectively the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace florida piedmont south carolina paulsboro new jersey and the pasadena texas locations is included in these amounts refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 

  

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario canada and south korea in addition the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities at the us state level california’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer is set to begin 1 january 2013 we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms 

increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the longterm impact on us any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen one of our main products and our proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity we do not have any derivative instruments indexed to our own stock our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business we did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties 

inflation 

the consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with us gaap and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years’ inflation while some inflationary pressures existed during the first half of fiscal year 2012 inflation in the us has been modest for several years in addition we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates with inflationary pressures that differ from those in the us the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2012 totaled 82406 and depreciation expense totaled 8137 during 2012 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

  

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

we have numerous longterm customer supply contracts particularly in the gases onsite business within the tonnage gases segment these contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years there are also longterm customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment these contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years additionally we have several customer supply contracts within the equipment and energy segment with contract terms that are primarily 5 to 10 years the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset 

the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally 15 years customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment where there is not an associated longterm supply agreement range from 10 to 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated longterm customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 

 

 impairment of longlived assets 

plant and equipment 

plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from 

  

estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity goodwill including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of 1264 was 17248 as of 30 september 2012 the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments goodwill increased in 2012 primarily as a result of the indura sa acquisition in merchant gases disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10 goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 

we perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year in addition goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists the impairment test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value including assigned goodwill we have designated our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly currently we have four business segments and thirteen reporting units reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore there were no indications of impairment 

we primarily use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of future cash flows to determine fair value of a reporting unit our valuation model uses a fiveyear growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business longterm contractual nature of the business relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units and limited comparables within the industry the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate operating profit margins discount rate and exit multiple revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions also the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

intangible assets 

intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 september 2012 totaled 6639 and consisted primarily of customer relationships as well as purchased patents and technology these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable see impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

indefinitelived intangible assets at 30 september 2012 totaled 977 and consisted primarily of trade names and trademarks indefinitelived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually in addition these intangible assets are tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists to determine fair value we utilize an income approach the royalty savings method this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 11757 at 30 september 2012 the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8 summarized financial information of equity affiliates to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

  

in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary an impairment loss would be recognized management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate at 30 september 2012 accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to 485 and 4757 respectively tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2012 were 1108 excluding interest and penalties income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2012 was 2873 disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 21 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in our effective tax rate would decreaseincrease net income by approximately 13 

pension benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the domestic and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of highquality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date this rate will change from yeartoyear based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 25 per year 

  

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated longterm returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets in determining asset class returns we take into account historical longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 15 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets this method recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur which reduces yeartoyear volatility expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets over the fiveyear period 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 12 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies ie situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and particulars are provided in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased or our proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases in the past we have also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oilbased feedstocks there were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at 30 september 2012 and 2011 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1 major accounting policies and note 12 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note 13 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 

at 30 september 2012 and 2011 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 49251 and 42611 respectively the increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of longterm debt excluding exchange rate impacts 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio including swap agreements as of 30 september 2012 primarily comprised debt denominated in us dollars 50 and euros 29 including the effect of currency swaps this debt portfolio is composed of 51 fixedrate debt and 49 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2012 with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 150 and 105 in the net liability position of financial instruments 

  

at 30 september 2012 and 2011 respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 162 and 113 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2012 and 2011 respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 26 and 23 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2012 and 2011 respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 26 and 23 per year at 30 september 2012 and 2011 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2012 and 2011 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 274 and 271 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro and the us dollar versus the pound sterling foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis

merchant gases 

merchant gases sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air process gases such as hydrogen and helium purchased or refined from crude helium medical and specialty gases and certain services and equipment throughout the world to customers in many industries including those in metals glass chemical processing food processing healthcare steel general manufacturing and petroleum and natural gas industries 

merchant gases includes the following types of products 

liquid bulk —product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases —small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and brazil in the united states the company’s current packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries 

small onsite plants —customers receive product through small onsites cryogenic or noncryogenic generators either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer 

healthcare products —customers receive respiratory therapies home medical equipment and infusion services these products and services are provided to patients in their homes primarily in europe the company has leading market positions in spain portugal and the united kingdom and in mexico through its equity affiliates

environmental controls 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs from time to time the company is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup additional information with respect to these proceedings is included under item 3 legal proceedings below the company’s accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 below 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 340 million in fiscal 2011 316 million in 2010 and 525 million in 2009 these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws remedial activities and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards the 2009 amount included a charge of 160 million for the paulsboro site refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine the company estimates that in both fiscal year 2011 and 2010 it spent approximately 6 million on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately 6 million in both fiscal year 2012 and 2013 the cost of any environmental compliance generally is contractually passed through to the customer 

the company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 82 million to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 96 million the accrual on the consolidated balance sheet for 30 september 2011 was 823 million and for 30 september 2010 was 870 million 

  

actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in any one year

 item 1a risk factors   tableend in conjunction with evaluating an investment in the company and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should carefully read the following risk factors any of the following risks could have a materially adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because common to all businesses 

overall economic conditions—a return of recessionary economic conditions in certain markets in which the company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues operating results and cash flow 

demand for the company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business recently uncertain economic conditions in the us and europe and in certain industries served by the company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example our electronics and performance materials segment could be significantly impacted by a downturn in the semiconductor market due to decreases in consumer confidence resulting from economic conditions or fiscal policy uncertainties our merchant gases segment has a significant amount of trade receivables with national healthcare systems in some european countries we believe the credit and economic conditions within certain members of the european union have continued to deteriorate these conditions have resulted in and may continue to result in an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries 

asset impairments—the company may be required to record impairment on its longlived assets 

weak demand may cause underutilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment and contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on its financial results 

competition—inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in all of its business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the company’s products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could materially affect the company’s profitability or its market share 

raw material and energy cost and availability—interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the company’s business because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and synthesis gas the electronics and performance materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials including alcohols ethyleneamines cyclohexylamine acrylonitriles and glycols shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact 

  

financial results a disruption in the supply of energy and raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent the company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results 

the company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results the company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

regulatory compliance—the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions and taxes can negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business the application of laws and regulations to the company’s business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so this area continues to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the company’s businesses 

greenhouse gases—legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario canada and south korea in addition the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities at the us state level california’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer is set to begin january 1 2013 increased public concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase the company’s costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could impact the company’s growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products 

environmental compliance—costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” above 

foreign operations political and legal risks—the company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability developing market operations present special risks 

the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions social unrest or strained relations between 

  

countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

our developing market operations may be subject to greater political legal and economic risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies we expect to achieve our longterm financial goals in part by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions including significant planned expansion in china should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions our results could be negatively impacted our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market including unfamiliar regulatory environments new relationships with local partners and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets 

margin and return on capital improvement goals are expected to be realized in part from productivity initiatives we may not be able to successfully implement initiatives to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

achieving our profitability and return goals depends significantly on our efforts to control or reduce our operating costs because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency or other initiatives such initiatives are important to our success if we are not able to identify and complete initiatives designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency or the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date or any future costsavings initiatives do not generate expected cost savings our financial results could be adversely impacted 

currency fluctuations—changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

a substantial amount of the company’s sales are derived from outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies the company also has significant production facilities which are located outside of the united states financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects but it is not costeffective to hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a below 

interest rate increases—the company’s earnings cash flow and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases 

at 30 september 2011 the company had total consolidated debt of 45622 million of which 6347 million will mature in the next twelve months the company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt although the company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates if interest rates increase the company’s interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes in addition changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing for a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk see item 7a below 

pension liabilities—the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its us and nonus pension plans 

adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities significantly affecting the net periodic benefit costs of its pension plans and ongoing funding requirements for these plans as a result the company’s financial results and cash flow in any period could be negatively impacted for information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters see the discussion in note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

catastrophic events—catastrophic events could disrupt the company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the company’s business financial results and cash flow 

the company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the company’s control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes and storms or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute its products 

  

and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact the company’s suppliers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the company’s products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

operational risks—operational and execution risks may adversely affect the company’s operations or financial results 

the company’s operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the company’s ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flow in addition the company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements the company’s operating facilities for the production of certain product lines primarily in certain electronic materials products are highly concentrated insufficient capacity may expose the company to liabilities related to contract commitments operating results are also dependent on the company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements failure to do so may expose the company to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

information security—the security of the company’s information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate 

we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and outsourced service providers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our intellectual property through security breach as with all large systems our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes the company’s systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to hacking attempts to date the company is not aware of any impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business involves the use storage and transmission of information about its employees vendors and customers the protection of such information as well as the company’s information is critical to the company the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements the company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information the company also from time to time exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the us breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information could result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

litigation and regulatory proceedings—the company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters 

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s results of operations in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company see item 3 below 

  

recruiting and retaining employees—inability to attract retain or develop skilled employees could adversely impact the company’s business 

sustaining and growing the company’s business depends on the recruitment development and retention of qualified employees demographic trends and changes in the geographic concentration of global businesses have created more competition for talent the inability to attract develop or retain quality employees could negatively impact the company’s ability to take on new projects and sustain its operations which might adversely affect the company’s operations or its ability to grow

 item 3 legal proceedings   tableend in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including contract product liability intellectual property and insurance matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages however we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any materially adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows 

from time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters 

the company is a party to proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are approximately 35 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current or former manufacturing sites we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these matters would have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” 

in early august 2011 the us environmental protection agency epa alleged that the company’s stockton california cogeneration facility failed to meet certain air monitoring requirements for short periods of time in 2006 and 2009 we disputed some of the allegations but agreed to settle the matter for a 140600 administrative penalty the settlement with epa was memorialized in a consent agreement and final order with an effective date of 30 september 2011 

on 16 february 2010 an unplanned shutdown at the company’s nitric acid plant in pasadena texas resulted in the release of nitrogen dioxide and nitric acid into the atmosphere in connection with the incident the company was contacted by federal state and local environmental regulatory authorities and the us occupational safety and health administration osha after a rigorous examination osha concluded its investigation with a “no findings” determination a complaint was filed in late june 2010 by harris county and the state of texas alleging various regulatory and air permit violations this action was settled in august 2011 when the parties entered into a court approved agreed final judgment pursuant to which air products paid a total of 36600 to the two plaintiffs and reimbursed them 4500 in attorneys’ fees 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against our brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million approximately 95 million at 30 september 2011 on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

  

we have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts certain of the company’s defenses if successful could result in the matter being dismissed with no fine against us the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is reasonably possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these or any other legal proceeding would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or net cash flows a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

we organize our operations into four reportable business segments merchant gases tonnage gases electronics and performance materials and equipment and energy 

2011 in summary 

in 2011 we had strong increases in sales and earnings in the first half of the year with a slowing in the second half due to product supply and cost issues and declining economic growth in the first two quarters of 2011 underlying sales increased 11 and 12 respectively due to strong volume growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 our underlying sales increased 7 and 6 respectively overall for 2011 sales increased 12 principally due to volume increases of 9 volumes increased in the electronics and performance materials and tonnage gases segments also we achieved significant growth in asia in the merchant gases segment operating income increased due primarily to improved performance in the electronics and performance materials and tonnage gases segments 

operating margin increased modestly from last year as operating leverage was partially offset by a number of product supply and cost issues in the last nine months of the year 

  

we withdrew our tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of airgas terminated the associated credit facility and sold previously purchased airgas stock

changes in diluted earnings per share attributable to air products 

 

   

2012 outlook 

with the significant degree of uncertainty around the global economy we are prepared for a wide range of economic developments management believes global economic growth in the regions we operate in could range from 2–5 in 2012 we expect that the us will have positive growth between 1–5 europe should range between a negative 2 to a positive 1 we believe asia will continue as the strongest region growing at 4–9 

regardless of global economic conditions we expect new plant onstreams to increase earnings in 2012 loading existing assets would also benefit earnings however this factor will be most influenced by the economy we also expect earnings improvement from our productivity efforts and cost controls in discretionary spending new programs and staffing these gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense next year as a result of a decline in the discount rates and lower asset returns lower equipment and energy results and a higher tax rate in 2012 the 2012 tax rate is expected to be approximately 26 excluding the impact of the completion of the tax examination and any changes in uncertain tax positions related to the two spanish tax matters as described in note 21 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements

 these favorable adjustments were partially offset by the impact of 2009 impairment charges of 1187 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued us healthcare business 

changes in working capital increased cash used by 3960 and included

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures are detailed in the following table 

 

  

  

 capital expenditures on a gaap basis in 2011 totaled 14083 compared to 11338 in 2010 resulting in an increase of 2745 additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the merchant gases and tonnage gases businesses during both 2011 and 2010 additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine ongoing nature including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements 

capital expenditures on a nongaap basis in 2011 totaled 15818 compared to 12984 in 2010 capital lease expenditures of 1735 increased by 509 reflecting higher project spending 

2012 outlook 

excluding acquisitions capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2012 on a gaap basis are expected to be between 1600 and 1800 and on a nongaap basis are expected to be between 1900 and 2200 the nongaap capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases which are expected to be between 300 and 400 the majority of spending is expected in the tonnage gases segment with approximately 1000 associated with new plants and pipelines it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations in addition we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates 

in september 2011 we entered into an agreement to acquire 25 of the outstanding shares of abdullah hashim industrial gases  equipment co ltd ahg the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary local closing conditions the closing date is expected to occur in early 2012 ahg is a company of the privatelyowned abdullah hashim group based in the kingdom of saudi arabia ahg is the largest private industrial gases company in saudi arabia it is comprised of three businesses including industrial gases equipment and consumables and refrigerants the transaction will be recorded as an investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates in the merchant gases segment with the purchase price included in capital expenditures in the period it closes 

financing activities 

2011 vs 2010 

cash used by financing activities decreased 952 primarily due to 

 

  

   

  

 2010 vs 2009 

cash used by financing activities increased 6747 primarily due to 

 

  

 financing and capital structure 

capital needs in 2011 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations at the end of 2011 total debt outstanding was 45622 compared to 41283 and cash and cash items were 4225 compared to 3743 total debt at 30 september 2011 and 2010 expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt and total equity was 434 and 420 respectively 

longterm debt proceeds of 4098 included 3500 from the issuance of a senior fixedrate 20 note additionally on 3 november 2011 we issued a 4000 senior fixedrate 30 note that matures 3 november 2021 the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes refer to note 14 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we have obtained the commitment of a number of commercial banks to lend money at market rates whenever needed effective 31 march 2011 we increased our total multicurrency revolving facility maturing in july 2013 by 1700 to a total of 21700 effective 30 june 2011 this 21700 facility was amended to extend the maturity date from 8 july 2013 to 30 june 2015 reduce facility fees to reflect current market rates and modify the financial covenant our only financial covenant changed from a maximum ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of no greater than 30 to a ratio of longterm debt to equity of no greater than 60 there were no other material changes to the terms and conditions of the arrangement this credit facility provides a source of liquidity and is used to support the issuance of commercial paper no borrowings were outstanding under this commitment at 30 september 2011 additional commitments totaling 4742 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries of which 4191 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2011 

we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 

in 2007 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 of our outstanding common stock we repurchase shares pursuant to rules 10b51 and 10b18 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended through repurchase agreements established with several brokers during fiscal year 2011 we purchased 74 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of 6492 which completed our 2007 1000 share repurchase program on 15 september 2011 the board of directors authorized a new 1000 share repurchase program at 30 september 2011 1000 in share repurchase authorization remains 

2012 outlook 

cash flow from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we project a modest need to access the longterm debt markets in 2012 primarily driven by debt maturities we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants also we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other shortterm debt markets 

dividends 

on 17 march 2011 the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from 49 per share to 58 per share dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter 

  

contractual obligations 

we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations the following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 september 2011 

 

 longterm debt obligations 

the longterm debt obligations include the maturity payments of longterm debt including current portion and the related contractual interest obligations refer to note 14 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on longterm debt 

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the longterm debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest we had 1229 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2011 excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2011 variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates 

leases 

refer to note 11 leases to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities the 2012 amount represents the low end of an estimated range of 40 to 60 refer to note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

unconditional purchase obligations 

most of our longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations which are primarily passthrough contracts with our customers we also have one supply agreement that is not matched to a customer sales contract that has terms extending to ten years and the related commitment is at prices that are not in excess of current market prices in addition purchase commitments to spend approximately 510 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2012 

  

we also purchase materials energy capital equipment supplies and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy which are obtained under requirementstype contracts at market prices in total we purchase approximately 74 billion annually including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 

other liabilities 

in june 2010 we entered into agreements obligating us to purchase 25 of the remaining shares of cryoservice limited csl the agreements require the consideration which is based on a multiple of earnings formula to be remitted in december 2011 at 30 september 2011 the liability amounted to 510 and has been reported in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet refer to note 19 noncontrolling interests to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income tax liabilities 

noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 september 2011 were 5701 refer to note 21 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2011 were 1264 these tax liabilities were not included in the contractual obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year 

pension benefits 

we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans—the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans over the long run the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 

for 2011 the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to 28237 from 27116 in 2010 the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was 37658 and 37536 in 2011 and 2010 respectively refer to note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits 

pension expense 

 

 2011 vs 2010 

the increase in pension expense net of special items was primarily attributable to the 60 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions in 2011 expense in 2011 included 13 of special termination and settlement charges 

2010 vs 2009 

the increase in pension expense net of special items was primarily attributable to the 150 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions expense in 2010 included 148 of special termination and settlement charges of which 28 was related to the global cost reduction plan 

2012 outlook 

pension expense is estimated to be approximately 120 to 125 in 2012 an increase of 7 to 12 from 2011 net of special terminations and settlements in 2012 pension expense will include approximately 91 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to 948 in 2011 net actuarial losses of 1277 were incurred in 2011 resulting primarily from actual asset returns below expected returns partially offset by actuarial gains experienced by the international plans as a result of an increase in discount rates actuarial gainslosses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gainslosses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2012 

  

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans with respect to funded plans our funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2011 and 2010 our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were 2410 and 4066 respectively the majority of the cash contributions were voluntary 

cash contributions to defined benefit plans including benefit payments for unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately 40 to 60 in 2012 actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 32 for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs from time to time we are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 340 316 and 525 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws remedial activities and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts the 2009 amount included a charge of 160 for the paulsboro site refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine we estimate that in both 2011 and 2010 we spent approximately 6 and 6 respectively on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately 6 and 6 in 2012 and 2013 respectively 

we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 82 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 96 the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2011 and 2010 included an accrual of 823 and 870 respectively the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace florida piedmont south carolina and the paulsboro new jersey locations is included in these amounts refer to note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario canada and south korea in addition the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities at the us state level california’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer is set to begin 1 january 2013 we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms 

  

increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the longterm impact on us any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen one of our main products and our proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity we do not have any derivative instruments indexed to our own stock our offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business we did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties 

inflation 

the consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with us gaap and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years’ inflation while some inflationary pressures developed during the second half of fiscal year 2011 inflation in the us has been modest for several years in addition we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates with inflationary pressures that differ from those in the us the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2011 totaled 74120 and depreciation expense totaled 8510 during 2011 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

  

we have numerous longterm customer supply contracts particularly in the gases onsite business within the tonnage gases segment these contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years there are also longterm customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment these contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years additionally we have several customer supply contracts within the energy and equipment segment with contract terms that are primarily 5 to 10 years the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset 

the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally 15 years customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment where there is not an associated longterm supply agreement range from 10 to 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated longterm customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 

 

 impairment of longlived assets 

plant and equipment 

plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets there were no such events or changes in circumstances that occurred during the reporting periods 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity goodwill including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of 626 was 9550 as of 30 september 2011 the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10 goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 

  

we perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year in addition goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists the impairment test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value including assigned goodwill we have designated our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly currently we have four business segments and fifteen reporting units reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore there were no indications of impairment 

we primarily use an income approach valuation model representing the present value of future cash flows to determine fair value of a reporting unit our valuation model uses a fiveyear growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business longterm contractual nature of the business relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units and limited comparables within the industry the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate operating profit margins discount rate and exit multiple revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions also the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

intangible assets 

intangible assets at 30 september 2011 totaled 2607 and consisted primarily of customer relationships as well as purchased patents and technology we have no intangible assets with indefinite lives intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable see impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 10116 at 30 september 2011 the majority of our investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8 summarized financial information of equity affiliates to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary an impairment loss would be recognized management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate at 30 september 2011 accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to 655 and 3477 respectively tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2011 were 1264 excluding interest and penalties income tax expense was 4084 for the year ended 30 september 2011 disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 21 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

  

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in our effective tax rate would have decreasedincreased net income by approximately 17 

pension benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans we determine assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 15 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the domestic and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched against the returns of highquality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate this rate will change from yeartoyear based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 27 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated longterm returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets in determining asset class returns we take into account historical longterm returns and the value of active management as well as the interest rate environment asset allocation is determined based on longterm return volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 bp increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 15 per year 

we use a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets this method recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur which reduces yeartoyear volatility expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets over the fiveyear period 

  

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption we determine this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 bp increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 13 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies ie situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and particulars are provided in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased or our proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost passthrough contracts with customers and price increases in the past we have also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oilbased feedstocks there were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at 30 september 2011 and 2010 

we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1 major accounting policies and note 12 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps foreign exchangeforward contracts and foreign exchangeoption contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position the net financial instrument position at 30 september 2010 does not include availableforsale securities of 1036 as disclosed in note 13 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements the availableforsale securities in 2010 primarily included the investment in airgas stock of 1025 which was subsequently sold in 2011 

at 30 september 2011 and 2010 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 42611 and 41282 respectively the increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of longterm debt excluding exchange rate impacts 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio including swap agreements as of 30 september 2011 primarily comprised debt denominated in us dollars 50 and euros 41 including the effect of currency swaps this debt portfolio is composed of 47 fixedrate debt and 53 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2011 with all other variables held constant a 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 80 and 87 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2011 and 2010 respectively a 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 85 and 95 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2011 and 2010 respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional 23 and 22 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2011 and 2010 respectively a 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 23 and 22 per year at 30 september 2011 and 2010 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2011 and 2010 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 271 and 345 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro and the us dollar versus the pound sterling foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows along with foreign exchangeoption contracts thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal or more favorable in the case of purchased foreign exchangeoption contracts to the impact on the instruments in the analysis

narrative description of business by segments 

merchant gases 

merchant gases sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air process gases such as hydrogen and helium purchased or refined from crude helium and medical and specialty gases along with certain services and equipment throughout the world to customers in many industries including those in metals glass chemical processing food processing healthcare steel general manufacturing and petroleum and natural gas industries 

merchant gases includes the following types of products 

liquid bulk —product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases —small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and brazil in the united states the company’s current packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries 

small onsite plants —customers receive product through small onsites cryogenic or noncryogenic generators either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer 

healthcare products —customers receive respiratory therapies home medical equipment and infusion services these products and services are provided to patients in their homes primarily in europe the company has leading market positions in spain portugal and the united kingdom and in mexico through its equity affiliate 

electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases—oxygen nitrogen and argon natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the company’s merchant gases facilities the company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through pricing formulas and surcharges a shortage or interruption of electricity or natural gas supply or a price increase that cannot be passed through to customers possibly for competitive reasons may adversely affect the operations or results of merchant gases during fiscal year 2010 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials 

merchant gases competes worldwide against three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag praxair inc and several regional sellers including airgas primarily with respect to liquid bulk sales competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications 

  

competition in the healthcare business involves price quality service and reliability of supply in europe primary healthcare competitors include the same three global industrial gas companies mentioned previously as well as smaller regional service providers in some countries such as spain and the united kingdom the company tenders for significant parts of the healthcare business with government agencies and is expecting to participate in tenders in some countries over the coming fiscal year 

merchant gases sales constituted 41 of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2010 44 in fiscal year 2009 and 40 in fiscal year 2008 sales of atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen and argon constituted approximately 20 of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2010 21 in fiscal year 2009 and 18 in fiscal year 2008

 item 1a risk factors   tableend you should read the following risk factors carefully in conjunction with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could have a materially adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

overall economic conditions—sluggish general economic conditions in certain markets in which the company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues operating results and cash flow 

demand for the company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business recently sluggish economic conditions in the us and europe and in certain industries served by the company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings while markets have stabilized relative to the extreme economic contraction in 2008—2009 industry utilization rates and therefore pricing pressure continue to be risks excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results 

asset impairments—the company may be required to record impairment on its longlived assets 

weak demand may cause underutilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on its financial results 

competition—inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in all of its business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the company’s products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could materially affect the company’s profitability or its market share 

raw material and energy cost and availability—interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the company’s business because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and synthesis gas the electronics and performance materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials including alcohols ethyleneamines 

  

cyclohexylamine acrylonitriles and glycols shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results a disruption in the supply of energy and raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent the company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results 

the company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results the company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

regulatory compliance—the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions and taxes can negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business the application of laws and regulations to the company’s business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so this area continues to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the company’s businesses 

greenhouse gases—legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in california and ontario in addition the us environmental protection agency has taken preliminary actions towards regulating greenhouse gas emissions increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase the company’s costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential increased cost through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could impact the company’s growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products 

environmental compliance—costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” above 

foreign operations political and legal risks—the company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability 

the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions social unrest or strained relations between 

  

countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

interest rate increases—the company’s earnings cash flow and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases 

at 30 september 2010 the company had total consolidated debt of 41283 million of which 4685 million will mature in the next twelve months the company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt although the company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates if interest rates increase the company’s interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes in addition changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing 

currency fluctuations—changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

a substantial amount of the company’s sales are derived from outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies the company also has significant production facilities which are located outside of the united states financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects but it is not costeffective to hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a below 

pension liabilities—the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its us and nonus pension plans 

adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities significantly affecting the net periodic benefit costs of its pension plans and ongoing funding requirements for these plans as a result the company’s financial results and cash flow in any period could be negatively impacted for information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters see the discussion in note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

catastrophic events—catastrophic events could disrupt the company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the company’s business financial results and cash flow 

the company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the company’s control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes and storms or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact the company’s suppliers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the company’s products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

operational risks—operational and execution risks may adversely affect the company’s operations or financial results 

the company’s operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the company’s ongoing operations financial results and cash flow in addition the company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements the company’s operating facilities for the production of certain product lines primarily in certain electronic materials products are highly concentrated insufficient capacity may expose the company to liabilities related to contract commitments operating results are also dependent on the company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements failure to do so may expose the company to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

  

information security—the security of the company’s information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate 

the company utilizes a global enterprise resource planning erp system and other technologies for the distribution of information both within the company and to customers and suppliers the erp system and other technologies are potentially vulnerable to interruption from viruses hackers or system breakdown to mitigate these risks the company has implemented a variety of security measures including virus protection redundancy procedures and recovery processes a significant system interruption however could materially affect the company’s operations business reputation and financial results 

litigation and regulatory proceedings—the company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust environmental or other matters 

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s results of operations in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company see item 3 below 

recruiting and retaining employees—inability to attract retain or develop skilled employees could adversely impact the company’s business 

sustaining and growing the company’s business depends on the recruitment development and retention of qualified employees demographic trends and changes in the geographic concentration of global businesses have created more competition for talent the inability to attract develop or retain quality employees could negatively impact the company’s ability to take on new projects and sustain its operations which might adversely affect the company’s operations or its ability to grow 

portfolio management—the success of portfolio management activities is not predictable 

the company continuously reviews and manages its portfolio of assets in order to maximize value for its shareholders portfolio management involves many variables including future acquisitions and divestitures restructurings and resegmentations and costcutting and productivity initiatives the timing impact and ability to complete such undertakings the costs and financial charges associated with such activities and the ultimate financial impact of such undertakings are uncertain and can have a negative short or longterm impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

risk factors related to the tender offer for airgas 

if the company is successful in acquiring airgas it will incur substantial transaction and mergerrelated costs 

if the company is successful in its tender offer for airgas see note 3 airgas transaction to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this transaction or otherwise succeeds in acquiring airgas it will incur substantial nonrecurring transaction and mergerrelated costs associated with the acquisition of airgas combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies although the company expects that the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the incremental transaction and mergerrelated costs this net benefit may not be achieved when expected or at all 

the company will carry significantly more longterm debt obligations if the acquisition is completed 

at the current tender offer of 6550 per share the total value of the airgas transaction would be approximately 74 billion including 57 billion of equity and 17 billion of assumed debt in connection with the tender offer the company has secured a 67 billion term loan credit facility the “bridge loan” and the company expects to retain approximately 1 billion of existing airgas debt if the tender offer is successful the company intends to finance the acquisition primarily by issuing public debt securities if the company is unable to successfully market this debt issuance the bridge loan will be drawn the bridge loan carries a higher cost than is anticipated for the public debt 

  

the issuance and assumption of this new debt will require a greater proportion of the company’s cash flow from operations to service this debt than the company has historically had to allocate to debt 

changes in our credit ratings may have a negative impact on our financing costs in future periods 

the company anticipates that the debt issuance to finance the acquisition of airgas will result in a temporary downgrade of its credit ratings the company’s credit rating is a significant factor in determining pricing and availability of its debt changes in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs in addition our current shortterm credit rating allows us to participate in a commercial paper market that has a large number of potential investors and a high degree of liquidity a downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm credit rating could likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue increase our commercial paper borrowing costs or both the company expects that its credit rating would be restored to current levels within a few years following the potential acquisition however inability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction or obtain projected prices for assets required to be divested or other unexpected developments may delay this restoration 

if the acquisition is completed we will be subject to integration and other risks 

if the company is successful in acquiring airgas the success of the merger will depend in part on its ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses to realize these anticipated benefits the company must successfully integrate the operations and personnel of airgas into our business it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees or the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business financial condition and operating results additionally if the acquisition is successful the company will be required to divest certain assets to comply with the consent decree approved by the us federal trade commission on 8 october 2010 failure to find suitable buyers or obtain a reasonable price for the assets could adversely affect the financial condition of the company

 item 3 legal proceedings   tableend in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including contract product liability intellectual property and insurance matters although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of the company’s business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages however the company believes that litigation currently pending to which it is a party will be resolved without any materially adverse effect on its financial position earnings or cash flows 

the company is also from time to time involved in certain competition environmental health and safety proceedings involving governmental authorities the company is a party to proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation presently there are approximately 30 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current or former manufacturing sites the company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in connection with these matters would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position additional information on the company’s environmental exposure is included under “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” 

in 2008 the us environmental protection agency made a referral to the us department of justice concerning alleged violations of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra related to sulfuric acid exchange at the company’s pasadena texas facility the company disputes the allegations but has agreed to settle the matter for a 1485 million civil penalty 135 million to the united states and 135000 to the state of texas and payment of 15000 to the state of texas for attorneys’ fees the settlement was memorialized in a consent decree which was lodged with the us district court for the southern district of texas houston division on 25 august 2010 and entered on 29 october 2010 

  

on 16 february 2010 an unplanned shutdown at the company’s nitric acid plant in pasadena texas resulted in the release of nitrogen dioxide and nitric acid into the atmosphere in connection with the incident the company has been contacted by federal state and local environmental regulatory authorities and the us occupational safety and health administration a complaint alleging various regulatory and air permit violations and seeking unspecified civil penalties attorneys’ fees and court costs has been filed by harris county texas at this time the company does not know whether any fines or penalties will be assessed however the company expects that any resulting fines or penalties will be immaterial to its consolidated financial results 

in september 2010 the brazilian administrative council for economic defense cade issued a decision against the company’s brazilian subsidiary air products brasil ltda and several other brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities cade imposed a civil fine of r1792 million on air products brasil ltda this fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the brazilian ministry of justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases the fines are based on a percentage of the company’s total revenue in brazil in 2003 

the company has denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in october 2010 to the brazilian courts certain of the company’s defenses if successful could result in the matter being dismissed with no fine against the company the company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is reasonably possible such a judgment is not probable as a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 

while the company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in connection with these or any other legal proceeding would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or net cash flows a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on the company’s net income in the period in which it is recorded

 for a discussion of the challenges risks and opportunities on which management is focused refer to the company’s 2011 outlook discussions provided throughout the management’s discussion and analysis that follows 

changes in diluted earnings per share attributable to air products 

 

   

2011 outlook 

the company projects that the gradual economic recovery will continue and that manufacturing will be the leading sector in the recovery the company anticipates global manufacturing growth of 3–4 in 2011 with stronger growth in asia and more gradual recoveries in the us and europe the company expects the us will have positive growth of 3–4 in manufacturing europe should increase about 1–2 and asia led by china is expected to continue as the strongest region growing at 6–7 

looking forward the company expects volume growth to be the key factor in driving earnings improvement in 2011 earnings should benefit from new plant onstreams in 2010 and 2011 along with the loading of existing assets these volume gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense next year as a result of a decline in the discount rates from september 2009 to september 2010 and lower expected asset returns based upon current rates the company does not expect currency to have a significant impact on 2011 earnings the company will continue to focus on cost control and will achieve benefits from the cost reduction efforts completed 

if the proposed acquisition of airgas is consummated in 2011 material impacts affecting most items in the company’s consolidated financial statements are expected in addition projections estimates and plans described in this management’s discussion and analysis would be materially impacted except where noted the outlook discussions provided throughout the management’s discussion and analysis do not include any impacts of the proposed transaction

unconditional purchase obligations 

most of the company’s longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts the company does not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements

the company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees the principal defined benefit pension plans—the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans the move to defined contribution plans has not had a material impact on retirement program cost levels or funding over the long run however the defined contribution plans are expected to reduce volatility of both expense and contributions 

for 2010 the fair market value of pension plan assets for the company’s defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to 27116 from 22510 in 2009 the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was 37536 and 33860 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in the obligation was due principally to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to measure future benefit obligations to 50 from 56 refer to note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on the company’s postretirement benefits 

pension expense 

 

 2010 vs 2009 

the increase in pension expense net of special items was primarily attributable to the 150 basis point decrease in the weighted average discount rate resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets due to higher contributions expense in 2010 included 148 of special termination and settlement charges of which 28 was related to the global cost reduction plan

pension expense is estimated to be approximately 122 in 2011 an increase of 278 from 2010 net of special terminations and settlements in 2011 pension expense will include approximately 94 for amortization of actuarial losses versus 668 in 2010 actuarial losses of 2948 were incurred in 2010 resulting primarily from lower discount rates actuarial gainslosses in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into pension expense over the average remaining service lives of the employees to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gainslosses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2011 

pension funding 

pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans with respect to funded plans the company’s funding policy is that contributions combined with appreciation and earnings will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 

in addition the company makes contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing its capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions the company analyzes the liabilities and demographics of each plan which help guide the level of contributions during 2010 and 2009 the company’s cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans were 4066 and 1848 respectively the majority of the cash contributions were voluntary 

cash contributions to defined benefit plans including benefit payments for unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately 247 in 2011 of this amount 200 was contributed in october 2010 actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 33 for a projection of future contributions 

environmental matters 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs from time to time the company is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup the company’s accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled 316 525 and 499 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws remedial activities and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts the 2009 amount included a charge of 160 for the paulsboro site refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge the 2008 amount included revised cost estimates for several existing sites 

although precise amounts are difficult to determine the company estimates that in both 2010 and 2009 it spent approximately 6 on capital projects to control pollution capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately 6 in both 2011 and 2012 

the company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 87 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 101 the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2010 and 2009 included an accrual of 870 and 950 respectively the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace florida piedmont south carolina and the paulsboro new jersey facilities is included in these amounts refer to note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

  

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in california and ontario in the us regional initiatives have been implemented that will regulate ghg emissions from fossil fueldriven power plants and some federal legislative proposals also focus on such power plants as a large consumer of electric power the company could be impacted by increased costs that may arise from such regulatory controls in addition federal legislation has been introduced in the us that would regulate ghg emissions from the company’s hydrogen facilities and other operations such as production of fluorinated gases manufactured by the company in addition the us environmental protection agency has taken preliminary actions towards regulating ghg emissions increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg 

the company may incur costs related to ghg emissions from its hydrogen facilities and other operations such as fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate prediction of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from company facilities could impact the company’s growth by increasing its operating costs or reducing demand for certain of its products 

regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for the company the company continues to develop technologies to help its facilities and its customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions the company is also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal and the company’s carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen one of the company’s main products and the company’s proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements the company is not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity the company does not have any derivative instruments indexed to its own stock the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

the company’s principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business the company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties 

inflation 

the consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with us gaap and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years’ inflation while the us inflation rate has been modest for several years the company operates in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing the company’s plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements describes the company’s major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the company’s accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires 

  

management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected the company’s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with its audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2010 totaled 70513 and depreciation expense totaled 8377 during 2010 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the company which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases the company would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

the company has numerous longterm customer supply contracts particularly in the gases onsite business within the tonnage gases segment these contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years there are also longterm customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment these contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term 

the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally 15 years customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment where there is not an associated longterm supply agreement range from 10 to 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated longterm customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 

 

 impairment of longlived assets 

plant and equipment 

plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets there were no such events or changes in circumstances that occurred during the reporting periods 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be 

  

impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge the company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

goodwill 

the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires the company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity goodwill including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of 602 was 9748 as of 30 september 2010 the majority of the company’s goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10 goodwill to the consolidated financial statements 

the company performs an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year in addition goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists the impairment test requires the company to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value including assigned goodwill the company has designated its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly currently the company has four business segments and fifteen reporting units reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 the company conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment the company determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore there were no indications of impairment 

the company primarily uses an income approach valuation model representing the present value of future cash flows to determine fair value of a reporting unit the company’s valuation model uses a fiveyear growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business longterm contractual nature of the business relatively consistent cash flows generated by the company’s reporting units and limited comparables within the industry the principal assumptions utilized in the company’s income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate operating profit margins discount rate and exit multiple revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in the company’s operating plan and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions also the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

intangible assets 

intangible assets at 30 september 2010 totaled 2857 and consisted primarily of customer relationships purchased patents and technology the company has no acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable see impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 9128 at 30 september 2010 the majority of the company’s investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized 

  

financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8 summarized financial information of equity affiliates to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary an impairment loss would be recognized management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate at 30 september 2010 accrued income taxes and deferred tax liabilities amounted to 736 and 3351 respectively tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2010 were 2337 current and noncurrent deferred tax assets equaled 2096 at 30 september 2010 income tax expense was 3395 for the year ended 30 september 2010 management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed the company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in the company’s effective tax rate would have decreasedincreased net income by approximately 14 

pension benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans the company determines assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 16 retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weightedaverage basis for both the domestic and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates the company believes the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date for the us plans the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched with an interest rate curve applicable to the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate in making this 

  

determination the company considers the yields on the citigroup pension discount curve and the citigroup above median pension discount curve the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next this rate can change from yeartoyear based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 23 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on an estimated weighted average of longterm returns of major asset classes in determining asset class returns the company takes into account longterm returns of major asset classes historical performance of plan assets and related value of active management as well as the current interest rate environment asset allocation is determined by an assetliability study that takes into account plan demographics asset returns and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 basis point increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 14 per year 

the company uses a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets this method recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur which reduces yeartoyear volatility expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets over the fiveyear period 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption the company determines this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 basis point increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 12 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company encounters contingencies ie situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the company the company accrues a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which the company’s accounting policy is discussed in note 1 major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and particulars are provided in note 17 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available the company reassesses probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased or the company’s proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on the company’s net income in the period in which it is recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   tableend the company’s earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is the company’s policy to minimize its cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

the company mitigates adverse energy price impacts through its cost passthrough contracts with customers as well as price increases the company has also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oilbased feedstocks there were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at 30 september 2010 

the company addresses these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see note 1 major accounting policies and note 13 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the company’s derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps foreign exchangeforward contracts foreign exchangeoption contracts and commodity swaps the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position the net financial instrument position does not include availableforsale securities of 1036 at 30 september 2010 and 194 at 30 september 2009 as disclosed in note 14 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements the availableforsale securities in 2010 primarily included the investment in airgas stock of 1025 

at 30 september 2010 and 2009 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 4086 and 4510 respectively the decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to a reduction in longterm debt and the impact of a stronger us dollar on the translation of foreign currency longterm debt 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company’s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects the company’s view of changes that are 

  

reasonably possible over a oneyear period market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by the company using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

the company’s debt portfolio including swap agreements as of 30 september 2010 primarily comprised debt denominated in euros 42 and us dollars 44 including the effect of currency swaps this debt portfolio is composed of 48 fixedrate debt and 52 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of the company’s debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the company’s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2010 with all other variables held constant a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 87 and 92 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2010 and 2009 respectively a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 95 and 92 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2010 and 2009 respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in the company’s debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional 22 and 20 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 september 2010 and 2009 respectively a 100 basis point decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by 22 and 20 per year at 30 september 2010 and 2009 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2010 and 2009 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 345 and 369 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the primary currencies for which the company has exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro and the us dollar versus the pound sterling foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where the company does business thereby reducing its net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts are also used to hedge the company’s firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows along with foreign exchangeoption contracts thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal or more favorable in the case of purchased foreign exchangeoption contracts to the impact on the instruments in the analysis

as of september 2009 the company completed the sale of its us healthcare business 

the company manages its operations assesses performance and reports earnings under four business segments merchant gases tonnage gases electronics and performance materials and equipment and energy 

financial information about segments 

financial information concerning the company’s four business segments appears in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein 

narrative description of business by segments 

merchant gases 

merchant gases sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air process gases such as hydrogen and helium purchased or refined from crude helium and medical and specialty gases along with certain services and equipment throughout the world to customers in many industries including those in metals glass chemical processing food processing healthcare steel general manufacturing and petroleum and natural gas industries 

merchant gases includes the following types of products 

liquid bulk —product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three to fiveyear contracts 

packaged gases —small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and brazil in the united states the company’s packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries 

small onsite plants —customers receive product through small onsites cryogenic or noncryogenic generators either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer 

healthcare products —customers receive respiratory therapies home medical equipment and infusion services these products and services are provided to patients in their homes primarily in europe the company has leading market positions in spain portugal and the united kingdom and in mexico through its equity affiliate 

electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases—oxygen nitrogen and argon natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the company’s merchant gases facilities the company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through pricing formulas and surcharges a shortage or interruption of electricity or natural gas supply or a price increase that cannot be passed through to customers possibly for competitive reasons may adversely affect the operations or results of merchant gases during fiscal year 2009 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials 

merchant gases competes worldwide against three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc and several regional sellers including airgas inc competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications competition in the healthcare business involves price quality service and reliability of supply in europe primary healthcare competitors include the same three global industrial gas companies mentioned previously as well as smaller regional service providers in some countries such as spain portugal and the united kingdom the company tenders for significant

 item 1a risk factors 

the company operates in over 40 countries around the world and faces a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially affect its future operations and financial performance many of these risks and uncertainties are not within the company’s control risks that may significantly impact the company include the following 

overall economic conditions—weak general economic conditions in markets in which the company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues operating results and cash flow 

demand for the company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business currently weak economic conditions in the us and other countries and in industries served by the company have impacted and may continue to impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the company’s ability to generate profits unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results in addition the length and severity of the economic downturn have increased the risk of potential bankruptcy of customers and potential losses from accounts receivable 

asset impairments—the company may be required to record impairment on its longlived assets 

weak demand may cause underutilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on its financial results 

competition—inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in all of its business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the company’s products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies could materially affect the company’s profitability or its market share 

raw material and energy cost and availability—interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the company’s business because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and synthesis gas the electronics and performance materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials including alcohols ethyleneamines cyclohexamine acrylonitriles and glycols shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results a disruption in the supply of energy and raw materials whether due to market conditions natural events or other disruption could prevent the company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results 

the company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results the company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

regulatory compliance—the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions and taxes can negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business the application of laws and regulations to the company’s business is sometimes unclear compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the company’s businesses 

greenhouse gases—legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in california and ontario in addition increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase the company’s costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential increased cost through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could impact the company’s growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products 

environmental compliance—costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect 

financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally—environmental controls” above 

foreign operations political and legal risks—the company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability 

the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions social unrest or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

interest rate increases—the company’s earnings cash flow and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases 

at 30 september 2009 the company had total consolidated debt of approximately 45015 million of which approximately 7859 million will mature in the next twelve months the company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt although the company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates if interest rates increase the company’s interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes in addition changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing 

currency fluctuations—changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

a substantial amount of the company’s sales are derived from outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies the company also has significant production facilities which are located outside of the united states financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects but it is not costeffective to hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see item 7a below 

pension liabilities—the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its us and nonus pension plans 

adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities as a result the company’s financial results in any period could be negatively impacted in addition in a period of an extended financial market downturn the company could be required to provide increased pension plan funding which could negatively impact the company’s financial flexibility for information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters see the discussion in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

catastrophic events—catastrophic events could disrupt the company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the company’s business financial results and cash flow 

the company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the company’s control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes and storms health epidemics and pandemics or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact the company’s suppliers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the company’s products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

operational risks—operational and execution risks may adversely affect the company’s operations or financial results 

the company’s operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the company’s ongoing operations financial results and cash flow in addition the company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements insufficient capacity may expose the company to liabilities related to contract commitments operating results are also dependent on the company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements failure to do so may expose the company to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

information security—the security of the company’s information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate 

the company utilizes a global enterprise resource planning erp system and other technologies for the distribution of information both within the company and to customers and suppliers the erp system and other technologies are potentially vulnerable to interruption from viruses hackers or system breakdown to mitigate these risks the company has implemented a variety of security measures including virus protection redundancy procedures and recovery processes a significant system interruption however could materially affect the company’s operations business reputation and financial results 

litigation and regulatory proceedings—the company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust environmental or other matters 

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company see item 3 below 

recruiting and retaining employees—inability to attract retain or develop skilled employees could adversely impact the company’s business 

sustaining and growing the company’s business depends on the recruitment development and retention of qualified employees demographic trends and changes in the geographic concentration of global businesses have created more competition for talent the inability to attract develop or retain quality employees could negatively impact the company’s ability to take on new projects and sustain its operations which might adversely affect the company’s operations or its ability to grow 

portfolio management—the success of portfolio management activities is not predictable 

the company continuously reviews and manages its portfolio of assets in order to maximize value for its shareholders portfolio management involves many variables including future acquisitions and divestitures restructurings and resegmentations and costcutting and productivity initiatives the timing impact and ability to complete such undertakings the costs and financial charges associated with such activities and the ultimate financial impact of such undertakings are uncertain and can have a negative short or longterm impact on the company’s operations and financial results

the company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 95 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 109 the balance sheet at 30 september 2009 and 2008 included an accrual of 950 and 829 respectively the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace florida piedmont south carolina and the paulsboro new jersey facilities is included in these amounts refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in any one year 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in california and ontario in the us regional initiatives have been implemented that will regulate ghg emissions from fossil fueldriven power plants and some federal legislative proposals also focus on such power plants as a large consumer of electric power the company could be impacted by increased costs that may arise from such regulatory controls in addition federal legislation has been introduced in the us that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions from the company’s hydrogen facilities and other operations such as production of fluorinated gases manufactured by the company increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghgs 

the company may incur costs related to ghg emissions from its hydrogen facilities and other operations such as fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate prediction of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from company facilities could impact the company’s growth by increasing its operating costs or reducing demand for certain of its products 

regulation of ghgs may also produce new opportunities for the company the company continues to develop technologies to help its facilities and its customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions the company is also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere enable cleaner transportation fuels and facilitate alternate fuel source development in addition the potential demand for clean coal and the company’s carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen one of the company’s main products and the company’s proprietary technology for delivering lowcost oxygen 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company maintained a solid financial position throughout 2009 cash flow from operations supplemented with proceeds from borrowings provided funding for the company’s capital spending and dividend payments the company continues to maintain debt ratings of aa2 longterm and a1p1 shortterm by standard  poor’smoody’s and retained consistent access to commercial paper markets throughout the year 

the company’s cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized in the following table 

 

operating activities 

2009 vs 2008 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 3567 or 21 the decrease resulted from the reduction in net income of 2784 combined with the unfavorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of 1707 partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of 924 noncash adjustments include depreciation and amortization impairment charges and sharebased compensation cost these adjustments also include changes in operating assets such as noncurrent capital lease receivables and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt or disbursement of cash and their recognition in earnings net income in 2009 included noncash impairment charges of 1187 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued us healthcare business in 2008 us healthcare noncash impairment charges totaling 3148 were partially offset by gains of 1059 on the sale of discontinued operations proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses are reflected as an investing activity 

changes in working capital decreased cash used positive cash flow variance by 924 and included 

 

2008 vs 2007 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1797 or 12 the increase resulted principally from a decrease in the use of cash for working capital of 2181 the decline in net income of 1259 was offset by the favorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of 875 net income in 2008 included a noncash impairment charge of 3148 related to the us healthcare business net income in 2008 also included a gain of 1059 related to the sale of discontinued operations and adjustments to income included an increase in noncurrent capital lease receivables of 1218 

changes in working capital decreased cash used positive cash flow variance by 2181 and included 

 

investing activities 

2009 vs 2008 

cash used for investing increased 1206 primarily from lower proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of 3720 partially offset by changes in restricted cash of 2706 

 

2008 vs 2007 

cash used for investing decreased 5633 principally from lower acquisitions of 4671 and proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of 4230 partially offset by changes in restricted cash of 1836 additionally the proceeds from asset sales declined 776 

 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures are detailed in the following table 

 

 

capital expenditures on a gaap basis in 2009 totaled 12363 compared to 11593 in 2008 additions to plant and equipment in 2009 increased by 940 compared to 2008 additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the merchant gases and tonnage gases businesses during both 2009 and 2008 additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine ongoing nature including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements 

capital expenditures on a nongaap basis in 2009 totaled 14749 compared to 13550 in 2008 capital lease expenditures of 2386 increased by 429 reflecting increased expenditures primarily in north america tonnage gases in 2008 capital lease expenditures of 1957 increased 1129 from 2007 reflecting higher project spending primarily in europe and asia 

2010 outlook 

capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2010 on a gaap basis are expected to be between 1000 and 1200 and on a nongaap basis are expected to be between 1300 and 1500 the majority of spending is expected in the tonnage gases segment with approximately 1000 associated with new plants it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations in addition the company intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates 

financing activities 

2009 vs 2008 

cash provided by financing activities increased 8000 primarily as a result of share repurchases of 7934 in 2008 in 2009 the company did not purchase any of its outstanding shares 

2008 vs 2007 

cash used for financing activities increased 6836 primarily due to 

 

financing and capital structure 

capital needs in 2009 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations at the end of 2009 total debt outstanding was 45 billion compared to 40 billion and cash and cash items were 5 billion compared to 1 billion total debt at 30 september 2009 and 2008 expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt shareholders’ equity and minority interest was 477 and 434 respectively 

longterm debt proceeds of 6105 included 4000 from the issuance of a fixedrate 4375 10year senior note and 1588 from industrial revenue bonds refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in september 2008 the company increased the size of its multicurrency committed revolving credit facility maturing may 2011 from 1200 to 1450 fifteen major global banks provide commitments under this facility and the company is confident that funding would be available from these banks if it were necessary to draw on the facility as of 30 september 2009 no borrowings were outstanding under this facility additional commitments of 3966 are maintained by the company’s foreign subsidiaries of which 2948 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2009 there was no commercial paper outstanding at 30 september 2009 

on 20 september 2007 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 billion of the company’s outstanding common stock during 2009 the company did not purchase any shares under this authorization at 30 september 2009 6492 in share repurchase authorization remained 

2010 outlook 

the company projects a limited need to access the longterm debt markets in 2010 due to its projected operating cash flows and its available cash balance at the end of 2009 the company expects that it will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other shortterm debt markets 

dividends 

on 19 march 2009 the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from 44 per share to 45 per share dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter 

contractual obligations 

the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations the following table summarizes these obligations of the company as of 30 september 2009 

 

longterm debt obligations 

the longterm debt obligations include the maturity payments of longterm debt including current portion and the related contractual interest obligations refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on longterm debt 

contractual interest is the interest the company is contracted to pay on the longterm debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest the company had 1413 of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2009 excluding fixedrate debt that has been swapped to variablerate debt the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2009 variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us shortterm taxexempt interest rates 

leases 

refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 

pension obligations 

the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the company that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 

the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates plan demographics actual return on plan assets continuation or modification of benefits and other factors such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 

unconditional purchase obligations 

most of the company’s longterm unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas facilities the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas however longterm takeorpay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply due to the matching of most longterm feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts the company does not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

the above unconditional purchase obligations include other product supply commitments and also electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations in addition purchase commitments to spend approximately 369 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2010 

the company also purchases materials energy capital equipment supplies and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy which are obtained under requirementstype contracts at market prices in total purchases by the company approximate 64 billion annually including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 

income tax liabilities 

noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 september 2009 were 3579 refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2009 were 1949 these tax liabilities were not included in the contractual obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the company is not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity the company does not have any derivative instruments indexed to its own stock the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

related party transactions 

the company’s principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business the company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates it is the company’s policy to minimize its cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 

the company mitigates adverse energy price impacts through its cost passthrough contracts with customers as well as price increases the company has entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oilbased feedstocks 

the company addresses these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies see notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company’s derivative and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps foreign exchangeforward contracts foreign exchangeoption contracts and commodity swaps the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position the net financial instrument position does not include other investments of 194 at 30 september 2009 and 156 at 30 september 2008 as disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

at 30 september 2009 and 2008 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 4510 and 3629 respectively the increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the issuance of new longterm debt and the impact of lower interest rates on the market value of longterm debt 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company’s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects the company’s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by the company using a thirdparty software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates spot and forward exchange rates and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 

interest rate risk 

the company’s debt portfolio including swap agreements as of 30 september 2009 primarily comprised debt denominated in euros 49 and us dollars 37 including the effect of currency swaps this debt portfolio is composed of 55 fixedrate debt and 45 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of the company’s debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the company’s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point move in interest rates from the level at 30 september 2009 with all other variables held constant a 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 92 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2009 

based on the variablerate debt included in the company’s debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements as of 30 september 2009 a 100 basis point increase or decline in interest rates would result in an additional 20 of interest incurred or lower interest incurred by 20 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 september 2009 with all other variables held constant a 10 strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase respectively of 369 in the net liability position of financial instruments 

the primary currencies for which the company has exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro and the us dollar versus the pound sterling foreign currency debt cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where the company does business thereby reducing its net asset exposure foreign exchangeforward contracts are also used to hedge the company’s firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows along with foreign exchangeoption contracts thus there is either an assetliability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal or more favorable in the case of purchased foreign exchangeoption contracts to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 

commodity price risk 

the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 50 change in the price of natural gas and oilbased feedstocks at 30 september 2009 with all other variables held constant the impact of a 50 change in these prices would not have a significant impact on the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 september 2009 

inflation 

the financial statements are presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years’ inflation while the us inflation rate has been modest for several years the company operates in many countries with both inflation and currency issues the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations it is estimated that the cost of replacing the company’s plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost accordingly depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the company’s major accounting policies judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the company’s accounting policies in many areas however application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made the reported results could be materially affected the company’s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with its audit committee 

depreciable lives of plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2009 totaled 68596 and depreciation expense totaled 8159 during 2009 plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straightline method which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 

economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the company which may be less than its physical life assumptions on the following factors among others affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear obsolescence technical standards contract life market demand competitive position raw material availability and geographic location 

the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness especially in light of changed business circumstances for example changes in technology changes in the estimated future demand for products or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated in these cases the company would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis likewise if the estimated useful life is increased the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

the company has numerous longterm customer supply contracts particularly in the gases onsite business within the tonnage gases segment these contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years there are also longterm customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment these contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years depreciable lives of the production assets related to longterm contracts are matched to the contract lives extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term as contract terms are extended the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term 

the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally 15 years customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment where there is not an associated longterm supply agreement range from 10 to 15 years these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances potential obsolescence competitors’ actions etc management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 

a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated longterm customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

plant and equipment 

net plant and equipment at 30 september 2009 totaled 68596 plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset grouping a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping or changes in the expected useful life of the longlived assets 

if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if an asset group is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value an estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions sales volume and prices costs to produce inflation etc changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge the company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 

goodwill 

the purchase method of accounting for business combinations currently requires the company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity goodwill including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of 561 was 9721 as of 30 september 2009 the majority of the company’s goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company performs an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year in addition goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists the impairment test requires the company to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value including assigned goodwill the company has designated its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly currently the company has four business segments and fifteen reporting units reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment there were no indications of impairment 

the company primarily uses an income approach valuation model representing the present value of future cash flows to determine fair value of a reporting unit the company’s valuation model uses a fiveyear growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business longterm contractual nature of the business relatively consistent cash flows generated by the company’s reporting units and limited comparables within the industry the principal assumptions utilized in the company’s income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate operating profit margins discount rate and exit multiple revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in the company’s operating plan and longterm financial planning process the discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk free rate of return cost of debt and expected equity premiums the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions also the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model and actual results could differ from the estimates 

intangible assets 

intangible assets at 30 september 2009 totaled 2626 and consisted primarily of customer relationships that were acquired as part of business combinations the company has no acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the longlived asset grouping impairment tests impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable see impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 

equity investments 

investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled 8681 at 30 september 2009 the majority of the company’s investments are nonpublicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 

in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary an impairment loss would be recognized management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate at 30 september 2009 accrued income taxes and deferred tax liabilities amounted to 429 and 3579 respectively tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2009 were 1949 current and noncurrent deferred tax assets equaled 2781 at 30 september 2009 income tax expense was 1853 for the year ended 30 september 2009 management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed the company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 

deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense 

a 1 point increasedecrease in the company’s effective tax rate would have decreasedincreased net income by approximately 8 

pension benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 

actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis therefore the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 

several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans the company determines assumptions about the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase note 15 to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted average basis for both the domestic and international plans the actuarial models also use assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover rates the company believes the actuarial assumptions are reasonable however actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement mortality and turnover 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date for the us plans the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched with an interest rate curve applicable to the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate in making this determination the company considers the yields on the citigroup pension discount curve and the citigroup above median pension discount curve the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next this rate can change from yeartoyear based on market conditions that affect corporate bond 

yields a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense a 50 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 20 per year 

the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on an estimated weighted average of longterm returns of major asset classes in determining asset class returns the company takes into account longterm returns of major asset classes historical performance of plan assets and related valueadded of active management as well as the current interest rate environment asset allocation is determined by an asset liability study that takes into account plan demographics asset returns and acceptable levels of risk lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense a 50 basis point increasedecrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreasesincreases pension expense by approximately 12 per year 

the company uses a marketrelated valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets this method recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur which reduces yeartoyear volatility expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets over the fiveyear period 

the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption the company determines this rate based on review of the underlying longterm salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience as well as comparison to peer companies a 50 basis point increasedecrease in the expected rate of compensation increasesdecreases pension expense by approximately 12 per year 

loss contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company encounters contingencies ie situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the company the company accrues a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when only a range of possible loss can be established the most probable amount in the range is accrued if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued 

contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which the company’s accounting policy is discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and particulars are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time as additional information becomes available the company reassesses probability and estimates of loss contingencies revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted for example due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated the scope of remediation is increased or the company’s proportionate share is increased similarly a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on the company’s net income in the period in which it is recorded

financial information about segments 

financial information concerning the company’s four business segments appears in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein 

narrative description of business by segments 

merchant gases 

merchant gases sells industrial gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air hydrogen and helium purchased or refined from crude helium and medical and specialty gases along with certain services and equipment throughout the world to customers in many industries including those in metals glass chemical processing food processing healthcare steel general manufacturing and petroleum and natural gas industries 

merchant gases includes the following types of products 

1 “liquid bulk” — product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are typically governed by threetofive year contracts 

2 “packaged gases” — small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and brazil in the united states the company’s packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries 

3 “small onsite plants” — customers receive product through small onsites cryogenic or noncryogenic generators either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer 

4 “healthcare products” — customers receive respiratory therapies home medical equipment and infusion services these products and services are provided to patients in their homes primarily in europe the company has leading market positions in spain portugal the united kingdom and mexico through its equity affiliate 

electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases — oxygen nitrogen and argon natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the company’s merchant gases facilities the company mitigates energy and natural gas prices through pricing formulas and surcharges a shortage or interruption of electricity or natural gas supply or a price increase that cannot be passed through to customers possibly for competitive reasons may adversely affect the operations or results of merchant gases during fiscal year 2008 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials however the company did experience significant increases in energy costs in most regions resulting in the need to increase industrial gas pricing 

merchant gases competes worldwide against three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc and several regional sellers including airgas inc competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications competition in the healthcare business involves regulatory compliance price quality service and reliability of supply in europe primary competitors include the same three global industrial gas companies mentioned previously 

merchant gases sales constituted approximately 403 percent of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2008 389 percent in fiscal year 2007 and 381 percent in fiscal year 2006 sales of atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen and argon constituted approximately 18 percent of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2008 19 percent in fiscal year 2007 and 20 percent in fiscal year 2006 

tonnage gases 

tonnage gases provides hydrogen carbon monoxide nitrogen oxygen and syngas principally to the energy production and refining chemical and metallurgical industries worldwide gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrallylocated production facilities and are generally governed by contracts with fifteen to twenty year terms the company is the world’s largest provider of hydrogen which is used by oil refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels to reduce smog and ozone depletion the energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification the metallurgical industry utilizes nitrogen for inerting and oxygen for the manufacture of steel and certain nonferrous metals the chemical industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and synthesis gas a hydrogencarbon monoxide mixture as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals the company delivers product through pipelines from centrally located facilities in or near the texas gulf coast los angeles california louisiana alberta canada rotterdam the netherlands southern england uk northern england uk to western belgium ulsan korea tangshan china kuan yin taiwan singapore and camaçari brazil the company owns less than controlling interests in pipelines located in thailand singapore and south africa 

tonnage gases also includes a polyurethanes intermediate pui business at its pasadena texas facility the company produces dinitrotoluene “dnt” which is converted to toluene diamine “tda” and sold for use as an intermediate in the manufacture of a major precursor of flexible polyurethane foam used in furniture cushioning carpet underlay bedding and seating in automobiles most of the company’s tda is sold under longterm contracts with raw material cost and currency passthrough to a small number of customers the company employs proprietary technology and scale of production to differentiate its polyurethane intermediates from those of its competitors 

natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen carbon monoxide and synthesis gas production electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases the company mitigates energy and natural gas prices through longterm costpassthrough contracts toluene ammonia and hydrogen are the principal raw materials for the pui business and are purchased from various suppliers under multiyear contracts during fiscal year 2008 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials 

tonnage gases competes in the united states and canada against three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc and several regional sellers for gases competition is based primarily on price reliability of supply the development of applications that use industrial gases and in some cases provision of other services or products such as power and steam generation similar competitive situations exist in the european and asian industrial gas markets where the company competes against the three global companies as well as regional competitors global competitors for the pui business are primarily basf corporation and bayer ag 

tonnage gases sales constituted approximately 34 percent of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2008 32 percent in fiscal year 2007 and 32 percent in fiscal year 2006 tonnage gases hydrogen sales constituted approximately 

17 percent of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2008 17 percent in fiscal year 2007 and 16 percent in fiscal year 2006

as of 1 november 2008 the company owned 983 united states patents and 3030 foreign patents and is a licensee under certain patents owned by others while the patents and licenses are considered important the company does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent patent license or group of patents or licenses 

environmental controls 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs from time to time the company is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the 

designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup additional information with respect to these proceedings is included under item 3 legal proceedings below the company’s accounting policies on environmental expenditures are discussed in note 1 and particulars on environmental loss contingencies are provided in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 below 

the amounts charged to income from continuing operations on an aftertax basis related to environmental matters totaled 31 million in fiscal 2008 25 million in 2007 and 26 million in 2006 these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws remedial activities and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards such costs are estimated to be 22 million in 2009 and 23 million in 2010 

although precise amounts are difficult to define the company estimates that in fiscal year 2008 it spent approximately 7 million on capital projects to control pollution versus 11 million in 2007 capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately 8 million in 2009 and 7 million in 2010 the cost of any environmental compliance generally is contractually passed through to the customer 

the company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 82 million to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 95 million the accrual on the balance sheet for 30 september 2008 was 829 million and for 30 september 2007 was 522 million actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in any one year

 item 1a risk factors 

the company operates in over 40 countries around the world and faces a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially affect its future operations and financial performance many of these risks and uncertainties are not within the company’s control risks that may significantly impact the company include the following 

overall economic conditions – weakening general economic conditions in markets in which the company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services or its profitability 

demand for the company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business currently deteriorating economic conditions in the us and other countries and in industries served by the company may negatively impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s revenues and earnings excess capacity in the company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the company’s ability to generate profits unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results 

asset impairments – the company may be required to record an impairment on its long lived assets 

weakening demand may create underutilization of the company’s manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines contract terminations or customer shut downs may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment contractual provisions may allow customer buy out of facilities or equipment or other events associated with weakening economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

competition – inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in all of its business segments introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the company’s products negatively impacting financial results in addition competitors’ pricing policies can materially affect pricing of the company’s products or its market share causing an adverse impact on revenues andor profitability 

raw material and energy cost and availability – interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the company’s business because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and synthesis gas the electronics and performance materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials including alcohols ethyleneamines cyclohexamines acrylonitriles and glycols shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results a disruption in the supply of energy and raw materials whether due to market conditions natural events or other disruption could prevent the company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results 

the company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results the company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery increases in energy or raw materials costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 

regulatory changes – the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions and taxes can negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the company from shipping company products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the company’s businesses 

greenhouse gases — legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk 

some of the company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta canada and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in california and ontario in addition increased public awareness and concern may result in more international us federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg although uncertain these developments could increase the company’s costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential increased cost through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the company any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could impact the company’s growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products 

environmental compliance — costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials the company takes it environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures in addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation these additional costs may adversely affect financial results for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally — environmental controls” above 

foreign operations political and legal risks — the company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability 

the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions social unrest or strained relations between countries can 

cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

interest rate fluctuations — the company’s earnings cash flow and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases 

at 30 september 2008 the company had total consolidated debt of 39668 million of which approximately 4514 million will mature in the next twelve months the company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt although the company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates if interest rates increase the company’s interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes 

currency fluctuations — changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the company’s financial results 

a substantial amount of the company’s sales are derived from outside the united states a significant portion of which are denominated in foreign currencies the company also has significant production facilities which are located outside of the united states financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects but it is not cost effective to hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see “market ratio and sensitivity analysis” included in item 7a below 

catastrophic events – catastrophic events could disrupt the company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the company’s business financial results and cash flow 

the company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the company’s control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes and storms health epidemics and pandemics or acts of war and terrorism any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims additionally such events could impact the company’s suppliers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the company’s products and services any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

operational risks – operational and execution risks may adversely affect the company’s operations or financial results 

the company’s operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents if operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the company’s ongoing operations financial results and cash flow the company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements insufficient capacity may expose the company to liabilities related to contract commitments operating results are also dependent on the company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements failure to do so may expose the business to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

information security — the security of the company’s information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate 

the company utilizes a global enterprise resource planning erp system and other technologies for the distribution of information both within the company and to customers and suppliers the erp system and other technologies are potentially vulnerable to interruption from viruses hackers or system breakdown to mitigate these risks the company has implemented a variety of security measures including virus protection a state of the art data center redundancy procedures

merchant gases 

merchant gases sells industrial gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air hydrogen and helium purchased or refined from crude helium and certain medical and specialty gases throughout the world to customers in many industries including those in metals glass chemical processing food processing medical gases steel general manufacturing and petroleum and natural gas industries 

merchant gases delivers its products by one of the following three methods 

1 “liquid bulk” — under which product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed by the company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed liquid bulk sales are typically governed by threetofive year contracts 

2 “packaged gases” — under which small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and brazil in the united states its packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries and 

3 “small onsite plants” — under which customers receive product through small onsites cryogenic or noncryogenic generators either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer 

electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases — oxygen nitrogen and argon natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the company’s merchant gases facilities the company mitigates energy and natural gas prices through pricing formulas and surcharges a shortage or interruption of electricity or natural gas supply or a price increase that cannot be passed through to customers possibly for competitive reasons may adversely affect the operations or results of merchant gases during fiscal year 2007 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials shortages of argon and helium did limit further growth in our merchant gases segment in fiscal year 2007 

merchant gases competes in the united states against three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc and several regional sellers including airgas inc competition is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of applications for use of industrial gases similar competitive situations exist in the european 

and asian industrial gas markets in which the company competes against the three global companies as well as regional competitors

 item 1a risk factors 

the company operates in over 40 countries around the world and faces a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially affect its future operations and financial performance many of these risks and uncertainties are not within the company’s control risks that may significantly impact the company include the following 

overall economic conditions and demand for products — general economic conditions in markets in which the company does business can impact the demand for its goods and services decreased demand for its products and services can have a negative impact on the company’s financial performance and cash flow 

demand for the company’s products and services in part depends on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business a downturn in economic conditions in a country or industry served by the company may negatively impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s operations and financial results further changes in demand for its products and services can magnify the impact of economic cycles on the company’s businesses unanticipated contract terminations by current customers can negatively impact operations financial results and cash flow the company’s recent divestiture of certain of its chemicals businesses along with the potential sale of its polymers business should make the company less susceptible to the cyclical nature of the chemicals industry 

competition — the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in most of its business segments inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the merchant gases segment competes with three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc as well as with several regional competitors in north america including airgas inc and in europe and asia competition is based primarily on price product quality reliability of supply and development of innovative applications 

the tonnage gases segment also competes with the three global industrial gas competitors noted above as well as with several regional competitors in north america europe and asia competition is based primarily on price product quality reliability of supply development of innovative applications and in some instances provision of additional items such as power and steam generation 

the electronics and performance materials segment faces competition on a productbyproduct basis against companies ranging from niche suppliers with a single product to larger and more vertically integrated companies competition is principally conducted on the basis of price quality product performance reliability of product supply and technical service assistance 

equipment and energy competes against many firms based primarily on technological performance service technical knowhow price and performance guarantees 

healthcare competes against many local and regional providers in the united states including apria healthcare group and lincare holdings inc and against three large industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc as well as local and regional suppliers in europe competition is based primarily on quality of service remaining competitive requires efficient logistic reimbursement and accounts receivable systems 

the chemicals segment competes against a large number of chemical companies generally on a productbyproduct basis principally on the basis of price quality product performance reliability of product supply and technical service assistance several of these competitors are larger than the company and are more vertically integrated 

raw material and energy cost and availability — volatility in raw material and energy costs interruption in ordinary sources of supply and an inability to recover unanticipated increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or significantly increase the cost of doing business

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and synthesis gas within merchant gases and tonnage gases volatility in hydrocarbon prices can impact the company’s financial performance while the company generally passes this risk through to its customers under its takeorpay contracts by matching feedstock prices to the purchase price of the product being produced an inability to do so in the future could impact its financial results 

the company’s large delivery truck fleet requires a readily available supply of gasoline and diesel fuel the company attempts to pass through increases in the cost of these fuels to its customers whenever possible 

steel aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents such as compressors are the principal raw materials in the equipment portion of the equipment and energy segment firm purchase agreements that cover the term of the project provide for adequate raw materials coal petroleum coke and natural gas are the largest cost components for the energy portion of this segment these costs are mitigated in part through longterm costpassthrough contracts 

the electronics and performance materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials including alcohols ethyleneamines cyclohexamine acrylonitriles and glycols the company purchases these materials from numerous suppliers though the company attempts to pass through increases in the cost of these materials to its customers whenever possible it is subject to competitive pressures 

the principal raw materials used in chemicals are chemical intermediates such as olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons produced by outside suppliers from basic petrochemical feedstocks like crude oil or natural gas this segment also depends on adequate energy sources and natural gas as a feedstock for certain products the company does not depend on any one supplier for its chemical intermediates supply 

despite the company’s contractual passthrough of the costs of energy raw materials and delivery fuel a shortage or interruption in their supply or an increase in any of their prices that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons can negatively impact the company’s operations financial results and cash flow

 item 1a risk factors 

the company operates in over 40 countries around the world and faces a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially affect its future operations and financial performance many of these risks and uncertainties are not within the company’s control risks that may significantly impact the company include the following 

overall economic conditions and demand for products — general economic conditions in markets in which the company does business can impact the demand for its goods and services decreased demand for its products and services can have a negative impact on the company’s financial performance and cash flow 

demand for the company’s products and services in part depends on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the company does business a downturn in economic conditions in a country or industry served by the company may negatively impact demand for the company’s products and services in turn negatively impacting the company’s operations and financial results further changes in demand for its products and services can magnify the impact of economic cycles on the company’s businesses unanticipated contract terminations by current customers can negatively impact operations financial results and cash flow the company’s recent divestiture of certain of its chemicals businesses along with the potential sale of its polymers business should make the company less susceptible to the cyclical nature of the chemicals industry 

competition — the company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in most of its business segments inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance 

the merchant gases segment competes with three global industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc as well as with several regional competitors in north america including airgas inc and in europe and asia competition is based primarily on price product quality reliability of supply and development of innovative applications 

the tonnage gases segment also competes with the three global industrial gas competitors noted above as well as with several regional competitors in north america europe and asia competition is based primarily on price product quality reliability of supply development of innovative applications and in some instances provision of additional items such as power and steam generation 

the electronics and performance materials segment faces competition on a productbyproduct basis against companies ranging from niche suppliers with a single product to larger and more vertically integrated companies competition is principally conducted on the basis of price quality product performance reliability of product supply and technical service assistance 

equipment and energy competes against many firms based primarily on technological performance service technical knowhow price and performance guarantees 

healthcare competes against many local and regional providers in the united states including apria healthcare group and lincare holdings inc and against three large industrial gas companies l’air liquide sa linde ag and praxair inc as well as local and regional suppliers in europe competition is based primarily on quality of service remaining competitive requires efficient logistic reimbursement and accounts receivable systems 

the chemicals segment competes against a large number of chemical companies generally on a productbyproduct basis principally on the basis of price quality product performance reliability of product supply and technical service assistance several of these competitors are larger than the company and are more vertically integrated 

raw material and energy cost and availability — volatility in raw material and energy costs interruption in ordinary sources of supply and an inability to recover unanticipated increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or significantly increase the cost of doing business 

electricity is the largest cost input for the production of atmospheric gases in merchant gases and tonnage gases because the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the financial performance of these segments while the company has been successful in contracting for electricity under multiyear agreements and passing through the cost to its customers there is no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 

hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and synthesis gas within merchant gases and tonnage gases volatility in hydrocarbon prices can impact the company’s financial performance while the company generally passes this risk through to its customers under its takeorpay contracts by matching feedstock prices to the purchase price of the product being produced an inability to do so in the future could impact its financial results 

the company’s large delivery truck fleet requires a readily available supply of gasoline and diesel fuel the company attempts to pass through increases in the cost of these fuels to its customers whenever possible 

steel aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents such as compressors are the principal raw materials in the equipment portion of the equipment and energy segment firm purchase agreements that cover the term of the project provide for adequate raw materials coal petroleum coke and natural gas are the largest cost components for the energy portion of this segment these costs are mitigated in part through longterm costpassthrough contracts 

the principal raw materials used in chemicals are chemical intermediates such as olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons produced by outside suppliers from basic petrochemical feedstocks like crude oil or natural gas this segment also depends on adequate energy sources and natural gas as a feedstock for certain products the company does not depend on any one supplier for its chemical intermediates supply 

despite the company’s contractual passthrough of the costs of energy raw materials and delivery fuel a shortage or interruption in their supply or an increase in any of their prices that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons can negatively impact the company’s operations financial results and cash flow 

regulatory and political risks and foreign operations — the company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business regulations address among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions healthcare services taxes and financial reporting and can significantly increase the cost of doing business which in turn can negatively impact the company’s operations financial results and cash flow 

the company is subject to government regulation and intervention both in the united states and in all foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business compliance with applicable laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and operating costs and changes to current regulations with which the company complies can necessitate further capital expenditures and increases in operating costs to enable continued compliance additionally from time to time the company is involved in proceedings under certain of these laws and regulations foreign operations are subject to political instabilities restrictions on funds transfers importexport restrictions and currency fluctuation significant areas of regulation and intervention include the following 

environmental and health compliance the company is committed to conducting its activities so that there is no or only minimal damage to the environment there is no assurance however that its activities will not at times result in liability under environmental and health regulations costs and expenses resulting from such liability may materially negatively impact the company’s operations and financial condition overall environmental and health laws and regulations will continue to affect the company’s businesses worldwide for a more detailed description of these matters see “narrative description of the company’s business generally — environmental controls” herein 

importexport regulation the company is subject to significant regulatory oversight of its import and export operations due to the nature of its product offerings the company voluntarily participates in various government programs designed to enhance supply chain security and promote appropriate screening practices and internal controls 

regarding its purchases and sales to customers around the world penalties for noncompliance can be significant and violation can result in adverse publicity for the company 

nationalization and expropriation the company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations and financial condition for a more detailed description of these matters see “ narrative description of the company’s business generally — foreign operations” herein 

home healthcare regulation the company’s healthcare segment is subject to extensive government regulation including laws directed at preventing fraud abuse kickbacks and false claims laws regulating billing and reimbursement under various governmental healthcare programs and laws related to the privacy of patient data enforcement actions may be brought by the government or by qui tam relaters private citizens bringing an action on behalf of the government which could result in the imposition of fines or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs also the government contracts with regional carriers who administer claims processing for governmental healthcare programs these carriers conduct both prepayment and postpayment reviews and audits which could result in demands for refunds or recoupments of amounts paid the company maintains a compliance program designed to minimize the likelihood that it would engage in conduct that violates these requirements or that could result in material refunds or recoupments in addition state and federal healthcare programs are subject to reform by legislative and administrative initiatives that could impact the relative cost of doing business and the amount of reimbursement for products and services provided by the company the company closely monitors reform initiatives and participates actively in trade association and other activities designed to influence these reforms 

taxes the company structures its operations to be tax efficient and to make use of tax credits and other incentives when it makes business sense to do so nevertheless changes in tax laws actual results of operations final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized can change the rate at which the company is taxed thereby affecting its financial results and cash flow

 item 1 business 

through internal development and by acquisitions air products and chemicals inc has established an internationally recognized industrial gas and related industrial process equipment business and developed strong positions as a producer of certain chemicals 

the gases business segment recovers and distributes industrial gases such as oxygen nitrogen helium argon and hydrogen and a variety of medical and specialty gases and also includes the company’s healthcare business the chemicals business segment produces and markets performance materials and chemical intermediates the equipment business segment supplies cryogenic and other process equipment and related engineering services 

financial information concerning the company’s business segments appears in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein which information is incorporated herein by reference as are all other specific references herein to information appearing in such 2005 financial review section of the annual report 

as used in this report the term “air products” or “company” includes subsidiaries and predecessors of the registrant or its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise 

gases 

the principal industrial gases sold by the company are oxygen nitrogen argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air hydrogen carbon monoxide carbon dioxide purchased purified or recovered through the processing of natural gas or the byproduct streams from process plants synthesis gas combined streams of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and helium purchased or refined from crude helium medical and specialty gases which include fluorine products rare gases such as xenon krypton and neon and more common gases of high purity are manufactured or precisely blended by the company or purchased for resale the gases segment includes the company’s electronics business global healthcare power generation and flue gas treatment businesses 

the company’s gas business involves three principal modes of supply 

  “onsitepipeline” supply —for large volume or “tonnage” users of industrial gases a plant is built adjacent to on or near the customer’s facility—hence the term “onsite” alternatively the gases are delivered through a pipeline from nearby locations supply is generally made under longterm contracts typically five to twenty years in duration in numerous areas—the houston texas ship channel including the port arthur texas area “silicon valley” california los angeles california phoenix arizona decatur alabama central louisiana rotterdam the netherlands korea singapore taiwan malaysia and brazil—air products’ hydrogen oxygen carbon monoxide or nitrogen gas pipelines serve multiple customers from one or more centrally located plants industrial gas companies in which the company has less than controlling interests have pipelines in thailand singapore and south africa 

  liquid bulk supply —smaller volumes of industrial gas products are delivered to thousands of customers in liquid or gaseous form by tanker trucks or tube trailers these liquid bulk customers use equipment designed and installed by air products to store the product near the point of use normally in liquid state and vaporize the product into gaseous state for their use as needed some customers are also supplied by small onsite generators using noncryogenic technology based on adsorption and membrane technology which in certain circumstances the company sells to its customers liquid bulk customers’ contract terms normally are from three to five years 

  packaged gases supply —industrial and various specialty and medical gases also can be delivered in cylinders dewars and lecture bottle sizes the company operates packaged gas businesses in europe asia and brazil but in the united states only sells packaged gases for electronics gases helium used in magnetic resonance imaging and oxygen used by patients in their homes 

oxygen nitrogen argon and hydrogen sold to liquid bulk customers are usually recovered or generated at large “standalone” facilities located near industrial areas or hightech centers or at small noncryogenic generators or are taken from onsite plants used primarily to supply tonnage users onsite plants are frequently designed to have more capacity than is required by their principal customer to recover additional product that is liquefied for sale to a liquid bulk market air products also designs and builds systems for recovering oxygen hydrogen nitrogen carbon monoxide and low dew point gases using adsorption technology 

sales of atmospheric gases—oxygen nitrogen and argon—constituted approximately 23 percent of air products’ consolidated sales in fiscal year 2005 24 percent in fiscal year 2004 and 25 percent in fiscal year 2003 

the largest markets are chemical processing electronics refining which uses inert nitrogen for oil well stimulation and field pressurization and hydrogen and oxygen for refining food processing which uses liquid nitrogen for food freezing and medical gases air products is a leading liquefier of hydrogen which it supplies to many customers including the national aeronautics and space administration for its space shuttle program the company has its largest industrial gas market positions in the united states and europe 

the company was impacted by hurricanes dennis katrina and rita the company’s new orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from hurricane katrina in august 2005 this facility is expected to return to substantial operations by the end of the calendar year for a discussion of the financial impact from these hurricanes see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein 

the global healthcare business of air products is directed at two main markets institutional and homecare the institutional market uses medical gases in hospitals clinics and nursing homes as well as helium for use in magnetic resonance imaging the homecare business involves the delivery of respiratory therapy services infusion services and home medical equipment to patients in their homes in europe south america and principally in the eastern united states 

the electronics business of air products is a materials and services solutions provider to the electronics industry supplying consumable products that surround its customers’ process tools these products include industrial gases electronic specialty gases such as silane arsine silicon tetrafluoride nitrogen trifluoride carbon tetrafluoride hexafluoromethane and tungsten hexafluoride electronic specialty chemicals high purity wet process chemicals and photolithography products in certain circumstances the company sells equipment related to the use handling and storage of such electronic gases and chemicals 

sales of industrial gases and sales of specialty products are made principally through regional offices in the united states europe south america africa and asia 

electricity and hydrocarbons including natural gas as a feedstock for producing certain gases are important to air products’ gas business see “raw materials and energy” the company’s large truck fleet which delivers products to liquid bulk customers requires a readily available supply of gasoline or diesel fuel also environmental and health laws and regulations will continue to affect the company’s gas businesses see “environmental controls” 

air products operates and has 50 percent interests in a 49megawatt fluidizedbed coalfired power generation facility in stockton california and in a 24megawatt gasfired combined cycle power generation facility near rotterdam the netherlands a 112megawatt gasfueled power generation facility in which the company has a 488 percent interest operates in thailand and supplies electricity to a stateowned electricity generating authority and steam and electricity to an air products industrial gases affiliate the company also constructed operates and has a 50 percent interest in a flue gas treatment facility in indiana

air products pursues a marketoriented approach to technology development that includes research and development engineering and commercial development the company conducts research and development principally in its laboratories located in trexlertown pennsylvania as well as in carlsbad california and phoenix arizona in the us basingstoke london and carrington in the uk burghausen and hamburg germany utrecht the netherlands tokyo japan shanghai china giheung korea hsinchu taiwan and barcelona and madrid spain the company also funds and works closely on research and development programs with a number of major universities and conducts research work funded by others principally the united states government 

research and development expenditures during fiscal year 2005 were 133 million 127 million in fiscal year 2004 and 121 million in fiscal year 2003 amounts expended by the company on customersponsored research activities during fiscal year 2005 were 17 million 14 million in fiscal year 2004 and 15 million in fiscal year 2003 

in the gases and equipment segments technology development is directed primarily to developing new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases electronic specialty gases electronic specialty chemicals and hydrocarbons developing new products and developing new and improved applications for such products it is through such applications and improvements that the company has become a major supplier to the electronics and chemical process industries including gases from air separation specialty gases and hydrogen additionally technology development for the equipment business is directed primarily to reducing the capital and operating costs of its facilities and to commercializing new technologies in gas production liquefaction and separation there are also development activities for the medical business supplying gases equipment and services to the homecare market 

in the chemicals segment technology development is primarily concerned with new products and applications to strengthen and extend the company’s present positions in polymer and performance materials in addition a major continuing effort supports the development of new and improved process and manufacturing technology for chemical intermediates and polymers 

a corporate research group supports the research efforts of the company’s various businesses this group includes the company’s corporate science and technology center which conducts research in areas important to the longterm growth of the company with focus on performance materials 

as of 1 november 2005 air products owned 1056 united states patents and 2376 foreign patents the company is also licensed under certain patents owned by others while the patents and licenses are considered important air products does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent or patent license or group of patents or licenses 

raw materials and energy 

the company manufactures hydrogen carbon monoxide synthesis gas and carbon dioxide principally from natural gas such products accounted for approximately 17 percent of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2005 the company’s principal raw material purchases are chemical intermediates produced by others from basic petrochemical feedstocks such as olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons these feedstocks are generally derived from various crude oil fractions or from liquids extracted from natural gas the company purchases its chemical intermediates from many sources and generally is not dependent on one supplier however with respect to vinyl acetate monomer that supports the performance polymer business the company is heavily dependent on a single supplier under a longterm contract that produces vinyl acetate monomer from several facilities the company characterizes the availability of these chemical intermediates as generally being readily available the company uses such raw materials in the production of emulsions amines polyurethane intermediates specialty additives polyurethane additives and epoxy additives such products accounted for approximately 22 percent of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2005 natural gas is an energy source at a number of the company’s facilities the company also purchases ammonia under longterm contracts as a feedstock for several of its chemicals facilities in 2005 the company began purchasing methanol under a longterm supply arrangement methanol produced from natural gas is a feedstock in methylamine production 

a longterm supplier of sulfuric acid used in the production of dinitrotoluene dnt emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2003 to facilitate the supplier’s ability to emerge from bankruptcy and to continue supplying product to the company the company agreed to participate in the supplier’s financing and has continued to provide additional financing total loans to the supplier at 30 september 2005 were 86 million if the supplier does not continue to operate the sales and profitability of the chemicals segment could be materially impacted on an annual basis because of the company’s inability to supply all of its customers’ base requirements the company does not expect a material loss related to this supplier 

the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electrical power electricity is the largest cost input for the production of atmospheric gases any shortage of electrical power or interruption of its supply or increase in its price that cannot be passed through to customers for competitive reasons will adversely affect the liquid bulk gas business of the company 

in addition the company purchases finished and semifinished materials and chemical intermediates from many suppliers during fiscal year 2005 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials 

environmental controls 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the united states and foreign countries where it has operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs additionally from time to time the company is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup additional information with respect to these proceedings is included under item 3 legal proceedings below the company’s accounting policies on environmental expenditures are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein 

the amounts charged to earnings on an aftertax basis related to environmental matters totaled 26 million in 2005 32 million in 2004 and 30 million in 2003 these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws as well as remedial activities and costs incurred to meet internal company standards such costs are estimated to be 26 million in 2006 and 27 million in 2007 

although precise amounts are difficult to define the company estimates that in fiscal year 2005 it spent approximately 8 million on capital projects to control pollution versus 12 million in 2004 capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately 7 million in 2006 and 7 million in 2007 

to the extent longterm contracts have been entered into for supply of product such as for the industrial gas onsite business and for certain chemical products the cost of any environmental compliance generally is contractually passed through to the customer 

it is the company’s policy to accrue environmental investigatory and noncapital remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 8 million to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 17 million the accrual on the balance sheet for 30 september 2005 was 13 million and for 30 september 2004 was 14 million actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in any one year 

competition 

the company’s businesses face strong competition from others some of which are larger and have greater resources than air products 

air products’ industrial gas business competes in the united states with three major sellers and with several regional sellers competition in industrial gas markets is based primarily on price reliability of supply and furnishing or developing applications for use of such gases by customers and in some cases the provisions of other services or products such as power and steam generation similar competitive situations exist in european and asian industrial gas markets in which the company competes against one or more larger entrenched competitors in most countries 

the division of the company’s gas business that serves the electronics industry offers electronic specialty gases chemicals services and equipment these products face competition from competitors who vary from product to product ranging from niche suppliers having only a single product to larger and more vertically integrated chemical companies with greater financial resources than the company competition in these products is principally on the basis of price quality product performance and reliability of product supply 

competition in the institutional market of the global healthcare business is principally from other large established industrial gas companies using business models longterm product supply agreements that are similar to those the companies utilize for other industrial gas supply relationships competition in this market is principally based on regulatory compliance fda price quality service and reliability of supply homecare is served by national and local providers and in the us there are over 2000 regional and local providers the homecare market is highly competitive in the united 

states reimbursement levels are established by fee schedules regulated by medicare and medicaid or by the levels negotiated with insurance companies accordingly in the united states homecare companies compete primarily on the basis of service maintaining competitiveness requires efficient logistics reimbursement and accounts receivable systems 

the number of the company’s principal competitors in the chemicals business varies from product to product and it is not practical to identify such competitors because of the broad range of the company’s chemical products and the markets served although the company believes it has a leading or strong market position in most of its chemical products for amines the competition is principally from other large chemical companies that also have the ability to provide competitive pricing reliability of supply technical service assistance and quality products and services the possibility of back integration by large customers is the major competitive factor for the sale of polyurethane additives in its other chemical products the company competes with a large number of chemical companies some of which are larger possess greater financial resources and are more vertically integrated than the company competition in these products is principally on the basis of price quality product performance reliability of product supply and technical service assistance 

the company’s equipment business competes in all aspects with a great number of firms some of which have greater financial resources than air products competition is based primarily on technological performance service technical knowhow price and performance guarantees 

insurance 

the company’s policy is to obtain public liability and property insurance coverage that is currently available at what management determines to be a fair and reasonable price the company maintains public liability and property insurance coverage at amounts that management believes are sufficient to meet the company’s anticipated needs in light of historical experience to cover future litigation and claims there is no assurance however that the company will not incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the coverage of its insurance 

employees 

on 30 september 2005 the company including majorityowned subsidiaries had approximately 20200 employees of whom 19500 were fulltime employees and of whom approximately 9200 were located outside the united states the company has collective bargaining agreements with unions at various locations that expire on various dates over the next three to four years the company considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory and does not believe that the impact of any expiring or expired collective bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse impact on the company

foreign operations air products through subsidiaries and affiliates conducts business in numerous countries outside the united states the structure of the air products gas business in europe is comparable to the company’s united states operation except that in europe the company is also engaged in a broader packaged gas business air products’ international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other economic political and regulatory policies of local governments the company’s industrial gas segment through investments ranging from wholly owned subsidiaries to minority ownership interests does business in approximately 35 countries outside the united states majority and wholly owned industrial gas subsidiaries operate in argentina brazil canada and mexico and throughout europe and asia in 16 and ten countries respectively there are 50 percent industrial gas joint ventures in canada and trinidad and tobago seven countries in europe four in asia and two in africa and less than controlling interests in africa canada and mexico four countries in europe and five in asia the company has a 50 percent joint venture in the uk that is developing products relating to silicon wafer polishing chemical mechanical planarization processes and hard disk polishing the company also has a 50 percent interest in a power generation facility in the netherlands and a 488 percent interest in one in thailand the principal geographic markets for the company’s chemical products are in 12 countries with operations in north america europe asia brazil and mexico majority and wholly owned subsidiaries operate in germany italy the netherlands the united kingdom australia japan korea china taiwan and mexico the polymer emulsions and pressuresensitive adhesives joint venture with wackerchemie gmbh has headquarters in the united states and production facilities in the united states germany mexico and korea along with a technical service center in shanghai china headquarters for the 20 percent investment in the redispersible powder venture with wackerchemie gmbh are in germany with manufacturing facilities in germany and the united states the company also has controlling interests in korea and taiwan and less than controlling interests in japan and ireland that sell chemicals to the electronics industry financial information about air products’ foreign operations and investments is included in notes 8 17 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein information about foreign currency translation is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein under “foreign currency” and information on company exposure to currency fluctuations is included in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein export sales from operations in the united states to unconsolidated customers amounted to 496 million 497 million and 533 million in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively total export sales in fiscal year 2004 included 301 million in export sales to affiliated customers the sales to affiliated customers were primarily equipment sales and electronic specialty materials sales 

technology development air products conducts research and development principally in its laboratories located in trexlertown pennsylvania as well as in carlsbad california dublin ohio and easton pennsylvania in the us basingstoke london and crewe in the uk burghausen germany utrecht the netherlands san juan del rio mexico and barcelona spain the company also funds and works closely on research and development programs with a number of major universities and conducts research work funded by others principally the united states government the company’s marketoriented approach to technology development encompasses research and development and engineering as well as commercial development the amount expended by the company on research and development during fiscal year 2004 was 127 million 121 million in fiscal year 2003 and 120 million in fiscal year 2002 the amount expended by the company on customer 4 

sponsored research activities during fiscal year 2004 was 14 million 15 million in fiscal year 2003 and 18 million in fiscal year 2002 in the gases and equipment segments technology development is directed primarily to developing new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases electronic specialty gases electronic specialty chemicals and hydrocarbons developing new products and developing new and improved applications for such products it is through such applications and improvements that the company has become a major supplier to the electronics and chemical process industries including gases from air separation specialty gases and hydrogen additionally technology development for the equipment business is directed primarily to reducing the capital and operating costs of its facilities and to commercializing new technologies in gas production liquefaction and separation in the chemicals segment technology development is primarily concerned with new products and applications to strengthen and extend the company’s present positions in polymer and performance materials in addition a major continuing effort supports the development of new and improved process and manufacturing technology for chemical intermediates and polymers a corporate research group supports the research efforts of the company’s various businesses this group includes the company’s corporate science and technology center which conducts research in areas important to the longterm growth of the company with focus on performance materials as of 1 november 2004 air products owned 1061 united states patents and 2102 foreign patents the company is also licensed under certain patents owned by others while the patents and licenses are considered important air products does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent or patent license or group of patents or licenses 

raw materials and energy the company manufactures hydrogen carbon monoxide synthesis gas and carbon dioxide principally from natural gas such products accounted for approximately 13 percent of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2004 the company’s principal raw material purchases are chemical intermediates produced by others from basic petrochemical feedstocks such as olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons these feedstocks are generally derived from various crude oil fractions or from liquids extracted from natural gas the company purchases its chemical intermediates from many sources and generally is not dependent on one supplier however with respect to vinyl acetate monomer that supports the performance polymer business the company is heavily dependent on a single supplier under a longterm contract that produces vinyl acetate monomer from several facilities the company characterizes the availability of these chemical intermediates as generally being readily available the company uses such raw materials in the production of emulsions amines polyurethane intermediates specialty additives polyurethane additives and epoxy additives such products accounted for approximately 26 percent of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2004 natural gas is an energy source at a number of the company’s facilities the company also purchases ammonia under longterm contracts as a feedstock for several of its chemicals facilities during 2005 the company will begin purchasing methanol under a longterm supply arrangement methanol produced from natural gas is a feedstock in methylamine production a longterm supplier of sulfuric acid used in the production of dinitrotoluene dnt emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2003 to facilitate the supplier’s ability to emerge from bankruptcy and to continue supplying product to the company the company agreed to participate in the supplier’s financing and has continued to provide additional financing total loans to the supplier at 30 september 2004 totaled 553 million if the supplier does not continue to operate the sales and profitability of the chemicals segment could be materially impacted on an annual basis because of the company’s inability to supply all of its customers’ base requirements the company does not expect a material loss related to this supplier the company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electrical power electricity is the largest cost input for the production of atmospheric gases any shortage of electrical power or interruption of its supply or increase in its price that cannot be passed through to customers for competitive reasons will adversely affect the liquid bulk gas business of the company in addition the company purchases finished and semifinished materials and chemical intermediates from many suppliers during fiscal year 2004 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials 5 

environmental controls the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the united states and foreign countries where it has operations compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs additionally from time to time the company is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup additional information with respect to these proceedings is included under item 3 legal proceedings below the company’s accounting policies on environmental expenditures are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein the amounts charged to earnings on an aftertax basis related to environmental matters totaled 32 million in 2004 30 million in 2003 and 24 million in 2002 these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws as well as remedial activities and costs incurred to meet internal company standards such costs are estimated to be 32 million in 2005 and 33 million in 2006 although precise amounts are difficult to define the company estimates that in fiscal year 2004 it spent approximately 18 million on capital projects to control pollution versus 16 million in 2003 capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately 15 million in 2005 and 17 million in 2006 to the extent longterm contracts have been entered into for supply of product such as for the industrial gas onsite business and for certain chemical products the cost of any environmental compliance generally is contractually passed through to the customer it is the company’s policy to accrue environmental investigatory and noncapital remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 9 million to a reasonably possible upper exposure of 19 million the accrual on the balance sheet for 30 september 2004 was 14 million and for 30 september 2003 was 15 million actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in any one year 

competition the company’s businesses face strong competition from others some of which are larger and have greater resources than air products air products’ industrial gas business competes in the united states with three major sellers and with several regional sellers competition in industrial gas markets is based primarily on price reliability of supply and furnishing or developing applications for use of such gases by customers and in some cases the provisions of other services or products such as power and steam generation similar competitive situations exist in european and asian industrial gas markets in which the company competes against one or more larger entrenched competitors in most countries the division of the company’s gas business that serves the electronics industry offers electronic specialty gases chemicals services and equipment these products face competition from competitors who vary from product to product ranging from niche suppliers having only a single product to larger and more vertically integrated chemical companies with greater financial resources than the company competition in these products is principally on the basis of price quality product performance and reliability of product supply competition in the institutional market of the global healthcare business is principally from other large established industrial gas companies using business models longterm product supply agreements that are similar to those the companies utilize for other industrial gas supply relationships competition in this market is principally based on price quality service and reliability of supply homecare is served by national and local providers and in the us there are over 2000 regional and local providers the homecare market is highly competitive in the united states reimbursement levels are established by fee schedules regulated by medicare and medicaid or by the levels negotiated with insurance companies accordingly in the united states homecare companies compete primarily on the basis of service maintaining competitiveness requires efficient logistics reimbursement and accounts receivable systems the company intends to attempt to acquire additional homecare companies provided that such companies can be acquired on terms deemed reasonable by management 6 

the number of the company’s principal competitors in the chemicals business varies from product to product and it is not practical to identify such competitors because of the broad range of the company’s chemical products and the markets served although the company believes it has a leading or strong market position in most of its chemical products for amines the competition is principally from other large chemical companies that also have the ability to provide competitive pricing reliability of supply technical service assistance and quality products and services the possibility of back integration by large customers is the major competitive factor for the sale of polyurethane additives in its other chemical products the company competes with a large number of chemical companies some of which are larger possess greater financial resources and are more vertically integrated than the company competition in these products is principally on the basis of price quality product performance reliability of product supply and technical service assistance the company’s equipment business competes in all aspects with a great number of firms some of which have greater financial resources than air products competition is based primarily on technological performance service technical knowhow price and performance guarantees 

insurance the company’s policy is to obtain public liability and property insurance coverage that is currently available at what management determines to be a fair and reasonable price the company maintains public liability and property insurance coverage at amounts that management believes are sufficient to meet the company’s anticipated needs in light of historical experience to cover future litigation and claims there is no assurance however that the company will not incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the coverage of its insurance 

employees on 30 september 2004 the company including majorityowned subsidiaries had approximately 19900 employees of whom 19300 were fulltime employees and of whom approximately 9200 were located outside the united states the company has collective bargaining agreements with unions at various locations that expire on various dates over the next three to four years the company considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory and does not believe that any expiring collective bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse impact on the company

item 1 business

      through internal development and by acquisitions air products and
chemicals inc has established an internationally recognized industrial gas and
related industrial process equipment business and developed strong positions as
a producer of certain chemicals

      the gases business segment recovers and distributes industrial gases such
as oxygen nitrogen argon and hydrogen and a variety of medical and specialty
gases the chemicals business segment produces and markets performance materials
and chemical intermediates the equipment business segment supplies cryogenic
and other process equipment and related engineering services

      financial information concerning the companys business segments appears
in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8
herein which information is incorporated herein by reference as are all other
specific references herein to information appearing in such 2003 financial
review section of the annual report

      as used in this report the term air products or company includes
subsidiaries and predecessors of the registrant or its subsidiaries unless the
context indicates otherwise

                                      gases

      the principal industrial gases sold by the company are oxygen nitrogen
argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air hydrogen
carbon monoxide carbon dioxide purchased purified or recovered through the
processing of natural gas or the byproduct streams from process plants
synthesis gas combined streams of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and helium
purchased or refined from crude helium medical and specialty gases are
manufactured or blended by the company or purchased for resale the gases
segment also includes the companys global healthcare power generation and
flue gas treatment businesses

      the companys gas business involves three principal modes of supply

      onsitepipeline supply  for large volume or tonnage users of
industrial gases a plant is built adjacent to on or near the customers
facility  hence the term onsite alternatively the gases are delivered
through a pipeline from nearby locations supply is generally made under
longterm contracts typically five to twenty years in duration in numerous
areas  the houston texas ship channel including the port arthur texas
area silicon valley california los angeles california phoenix arizona
decatur alabama central louisiana rotterdam the netherlands korea
singapore taiwan malaysia and brazil  air products hydrogen oxygen
carbon monoxide or nitrogen gas pipelines serve multiple customers from one or
more centrally located plants industrial gas companies in which the company has
less than controlling interests have pipelines in thailand singapore and south
africa

      liquid bulk supply  smaller volumes of industrial gas products are
delivered to thousands of customers in liquid or gaseous form by tanker trucks
or tube trailers these liquid bulk customers use equipment designed and
installed by air products to store the product near the point of use normally
in liquid state and vaporize the product into gaseous state for their use as
needed some customers are also supplied by small onsite generators using
noncryogenic technology based on adsorption and membrane technology which in
certain circumstances the company sells to its customers liquid bulk
customers contract terms normally are from three to five years

      packaged gases supply  industrial and various specialty and medical
gases are also delivered in cylinders dewars and lecture bottle sizes during
fiscal year 2002 the company divested its us packaged gas business except for
electronics gases and helium used in magnetic resonance imaging during fiscal
year 2003 the company divested similar businesses in canada and puerto rico
the company continues to operate packaged gas businesses in europe asia and
brazil

      oxygen nitrogen argon and hydrogen sold to liquid bulk customers are
usually recovered or generated at large standalone facilities located near
industrial areas or hightech centers or at small noncryogenic generators or
are taken from onsite plants used primarily to supply tonnage users onsite
plants are frequently designed to have more capacity than is required by their
principal customer to recover additional product that is liquefied for sale to a
liquid bulk market air products also designs and builds systems for recovering
oxygen hydrogen nitrogen carbon monoxide and low dew point gases using
adsorption technology



                                        1

      sales of atmospheric gases  oxygen nitrogen and argon  constituted
approximately 25 percent of air products consolidated sales in fiscal year
2003 26 percent in fiscal year 2002 and 24 percent in fiscal year 2001 sales
of industrial gases  principally oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen  to the
chemical process industry and the electronics industry the largest consuming
industries were approximately 22 percent and 13 percent respectively of air
products consolidated sales in fiscal year 2003

      other important consumers of air products industrial and specialty gases
are the basic steel industry the oil industry which uses inert nitrogen for
oil well stimulation and field pressurization and hydrogen and oxygen for
refining and the food industry which uses liquid nitrogen for food freezing
air products believes that it is the largest liquefier of hydrogen which it
supplies to many customers including the national aeronautics and space
administration for its space shuttle program

      the global healthcare business of air products is directed at two main
markets institutional and homecare the institutional market uses medical gases
in hospitals clinics and nursing homes as well as helium for use in magnetic
resonance imaging the homecare business involves the delivery of respiratory
therapy services infusion services and home medical equipment to patients in
their homes in europe south america and principally in the eastern united
states

      specialty gases include fluorine products rare gases such as xenon
krypton and neon and more common gases of high purity or gases that are
precisely blended as mixtures specialty chemicals for use by the electronics
industry include silane arsine silicon tetrafluoride nitrogen trifluoride
carbon tetrafluoride hexafluoromethane and tungsten hexafluoride these gases

million in fiscal year 2001 the amount expended by the company on
customersponsored research activities during fiscal year 2003 was 15 million
18 million in fiscal year 2002 and 19 million in fiscal year 2001

      in the gases and equipment segments technology development is directed
primarily to developing new and improved processes and equipment for the
production and delivery of industrial gases and cryogenic fluids developing new
products and developing new and improved applications for industrial gases it
is through such applications and improvements that the company has become a
major supplier to the electronics and chemical process industries including
gases from air separation specialty gases and hydrogen additionally
technology development for the equipment business is directed primarily to
reducing the capital and operating costs of its facilities and to
commercializing new technologies in gas production liquefaction and
separation

      in the chemicals segment technology development is primarily concerned
with new products and applications to strengthen and extend our present
positions in polymer and performance materials in addition a major continuing
effort supports the development of new and improved process and manufacturing
technology for chemical intermediates and polymers

      a corporate research group supports the research efforts of the companys
various businesses this group includes the companys corporate science and
technology center which conducts research in areas important to the longterm
growth of the company with focus on performance materials

      as of 1 november 2003 air products owned 1041 united states patents and
1889 foreign patents the company is also licensed under certain patents owned
by others while the patents and licenses are considered important air products
does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any
particular patent or patent license or group of patents or licenses

raw materials and energy

      the company manufactures hydrogen carbon monoxide synthesis gas and
carbon dioxide principally from natural gas such products accounted for
approximately 13 percent of the companys consolidated sales in fiscal year
2003 the companys principal raw material purchases are chemical intermediates
produced by others from basic petrochemical feedstocks such as olefins and
aromatic hydrocarbons these feedstocks are generally derived from various
crude oil fractions or from liquids extracted from natural gas the company
purchases its chemical intermediates from many sources and generally is not
dependent on one supplier however with respect to vinyl acetate monomer that
supports the polymer business the company is heavily dependent on a single
supplier under a longterm contract that produces vinyl acetate monomer from
several facilities the company characterizes the availability of these
chemical intermediates as generally being readily available the company uses
such raw materials in the production of emulsions amines polyurethane
intermediates specialty additives polyurethane additives and epoxy
additives such products accounted for approximately 26 percent of the
companys consolidated sales in fiscal year 2003 natural gas is an energy
source at a number of the companys facilities the company also purchases
ammonia under longterm contracts as a feedstock for several of its chemicals
facilities

      a longterm supplier of sulfuric acid used in the production of
dinitrotoluene dnt emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in june
2003 to facilitate the suppliers ability to emerge from bankruptcy and to
continue supplying product to the company the company agreed to participate in
the suppliers financing and has continued to supply additional financing total
loans to the supplier at 30 november 2003 were 451 million if the supplier
does not continue to operate the sales and profitability of the chemicals
segment could be materially impacted on an annual basis because of the companys
inability to supply all of its customers base requirements the company does
not expect a material loss related to this supplier

      the companys industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of
electrical power electricity is the largest cost input for the production of
atmospheric gases any shortage of electrical power or interruption of its
supply or increase in its price that cannot be passed through to customers for
competitive reasons will adversely affect the liquid bulk gas business of the
company



                                       5

      in addition the company purchases finished and semifinished materials
and chemical intermediates from many suppliers during fiscal year 2003 no
significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of
energy or raw materials

environmental controls

      the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in
the united states and foreign countries where it has operations compliance with
these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs
additionally from time to time the company is involved in proceedings under
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the
federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation and
recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for
investigation and possible cleanup additional information with respect to these
proceedings is included under item 3 legal proceedings below the companys
accounting policies on environmental expenditures are discussed in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein

      the amounts charged to earnings on an aftertax basis related to
environmental matters totaled 30 million in 2003 24 million in 2002 and 22
million in 2001 these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance
with environmental laws as well as remedial activities and costs incurred to
meet internal company standards such costs are estimated to be 30 million in
2004 and 31 million in 2005

      although precise amounts are difficult to define the company estimates
that in fiscal year 2003 it spent approximately 16 million on capital projects
to control pollution versus 14 million in 2002 capital expenditures to control
pollution in future years are estimated at approximately 17 million in 2004 and
14 million in 2005

      to the extent longterm contracts have been entered into for supply of
product such as for the industrial gas onsite business and for certain
chemical products the cost of any environmental compliance generally is
contractually passed through to the customer

      it is the companys policy to accrue environmental investigatory and
noncapital remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated
the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 9 million to a
reasonably possible upper exposure of 21 million the accrual on the balance
sheet for both 30 september 2003 and 30 september 2002 was 15 million actual
costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given
inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the
imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not
expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters
in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially
adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in any one
year

competition

      the companys businesses face strong competition from others some of
which are larger and have greater resources than air products

      air products industrial gas business competes in the united states with
three major sellers and with several regional sellers competition in industrial
gas markets is based primarily on price reliability of supply and furnishing
or developing applications for use of such gases by customers and in some cases
the provisions of other services or products such as power and steam generation
similar competitive situations exist in european and asian industrial gas
markets in which the company competes against one or more larger entrenched
competitors in most countries

      the division of the companys gas business that serves the electronics
industry offers electronic specialty gases chemicals services and equipment
these products face competition from competitors who vary from product to
product ranging from niche suppliers having only a single product to larger
and more vertically integrated chemical companies with greater financial
resources than the company competition in these products is principally on the
basis of price quality product performance and reliability of product supply

      competition in the institutional market of the global healthcare business
is principally from other large established industrial gas companies using
business models longterm product supply agreements that are similar to those
the companies utilize for other industrial gas supply relationships competition
in this market is principally based on price quality service and reliability
of supply homecare is served by national and local providers and in the us
there are over 2000 regional and local providers the homecare market is highly
competitive in the united states reimbursement levels are established by fee
schedules regulated by medicare and



                                       6

medicaid or by the levels determined by insurance companies accordingly in
the united states homecare companies compete primarily on the basis of service
maintaining competitiveness requires efficient logistics reimbursement and
accounts receivable systems although the company intends to acquire additional
homecare companies there is no guarantee that suitable candidates can be
acquired or that the necessary managed care contracts will be on favorable
terms

      the number of the companys principal competitors in the chemicals
business varies from product to product and it is not practical to identify
such competitors because of the broad range of the companys chemical products
and the markets served although the company believes it has a leading or strong
market position in most of its chemical products for amines the competition is
principally from other large chemical companies that also have the ability to
provide competitive pricing reliability of supply technical service
assistance and quality products and services the possibility of back
integration by large customers is the major competitive factor for the sale of
polyurethane additives in its other chemical products the company competes
with a large number of chemical companies some of which are larger possess
greater financial resources and are more vertically integrated than the
company competition in these products is principally on the basis of price
quality product performance reliability of product supply and technical
service assistance

      the companys equipment business competes in all aspects with a great
number of firms some of which have greater financial resources than air
products competition is based primarily on technological performance service
technical knowhow price and performance guarantees

insurance

      the companys policy is to obtain public liability and property insurance
coverage that is currently available at what management determines to be a fair
and reasonable price the company maintains public liability and property
insurance coverage at amounts that management believes are sufficient to meet
the companys anticipated needs in light of historical experience to cover
future litigation and claims there is no assurance however that the company
will not incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the coverage of its
insurance

employees

      on 30 september 2003 the company including majorityowned subsidiaries
had approximately 18500 fulltime employees of whom approximately 8700 were
located outside the united states the company has collective bargaining
agreements with unions at various locations that expire on assorted dates over
the next three to four years in late november 2003 the contract at the
wilkesbarre manufacturing facility where hourly employees are represented by
the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iamaw
expired and the workforce went on strike contract negotiations had been
conducted with the unions negotiating team but the union membership rejected
the agreement its leadership had unanimously recommended the wilkesbarre
facility principally manufactures heat exchangers for natural gas liquefaction
and equipment for cryogenic air separation the company is negotiating two new
contracts with the teamsters in easton pennsylvania and with the pace union in
dallas texas as a result of the recent ashland acquisition although there are
no firm dates associated with these later two contracts the company hopes to
resolve them sometime in the second fiscal quarter the company considers
relations with its employees to be satisfactory with the exception of the
current strike the company does not believe that the impact of any expiring or
expired collective bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse
impact on the company

          the gases business segment recovers and distributes industrial gases
such as oxygen nitrogen argon and hydrogen and a variety of medical and
specialty gases the chemicals business segment produces and markets performance
materials and chemical intermediates the equipment business segment supplies
cryogenic and other process equipment and related engineering services

          financial information concerning the companys business segments
appears in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included under item
8 herein which information is incorporated herein by reference as are all
other specific references herein to information appearing in such 2002 financial
review section of the annual report

          as used in this report the term air products or company includes
subsidiaries and predecessors of the registrant or its subsidiaries unless the
context indicates otherwise

                                      gases

          the principal industrial gases sold by the company are oxygen
nitrogen argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air
hydrogen carbon monoxide carbon dioxide purchased purified or recovered
through the processing of natural gas or the byproduct streams from process
plants synthesis gas combined streams of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and
helium purchased or refined from crude helium medical and specialty gases are
manufactured or blended by the company or purchased for resale the gases
segment also includes the companys global healthcare power generation and
flue gas treatment businesses

          the companys gas business involves three principal modes of supply

          onsitepipeline supplyfor large volume or tonnage users of
industrial gases a plant is built adjacent to on or near the customers
facilityhence the term onsite alternatively the gases are delivered
through a pipeline from nearby locations supply is generally made under long
term contracts in numerous areasthe houston texas ship channel including
the port arthur texas area silicon valley california los angeles
california phoenix arizona decatur alabama central louisiana rotterdam
the netherlands korea singapore taiwan malaysia and brazilair products
hydrogen oxygen carbon monoxide or nitrogen gas pipelines serve multiple
customers from one or more centrally located plants industrial gas companies in
which the company has less than controlling interests have pipelines in
thailand singapore and south africa

          liquid bulk supplysmaller volumes of industrial gas products are
delivered to thousands of customers in liquid or gaseous form by tanker trucks
or tube trailers these liquid bulk customers use equipment designed and
installed by air products to store the product near the point of use normally
in liquid state and vaporize the product into gaseous state for their use as
needed some customers are also supplied by small onsite generators using
noncryogenic technology based on adsorption and membrane technology which in
certain circumstances the company sells to its customers liquid bulk
customers contract terms normally are from three to five years

          packaged gases supplyindustrial and various specialty and medical
gases are also delivered in cylinders dewars and lecture bottle sizes during
fiscal year 2002 the company divested its historic us packaged gas business
except for electronics gases and helium used in magnetic resonance imaging the
company is pursuing a similar divestiture in canada

          oxygen nitrogen argon and hydrogen sold to liquid bulk customers
are usually recovered or generated at large standalone facilities located
near industrial areas or hightech centers or at small noncryogenic generators
or are taken from onsite plants used primarily to supply tonnage users onsite
plants are frequently designed to have more capacity than is required by their
principal customer to recover additional product that is liquefied for sale to a
liquid bulk market air products also designs and builds

in fiscal year 2001 and 25 in fiscal year 2000 sales of industrial
gasesprincipally oxygen nitrogen and hydrogento the chemical process
industry and the electronics industry the largest consuming industries were
approximately 20 and 14 respectively of air products consolidated sales in
fiscal year 2002

          other important consumers of air products industrial and specialty
gases are the basic steel industry the oil industry which uses inert nitrogen
for oil well stimulation and field pressurization and hydrogen and oxygen for
refining and the food industry which uses liquid nitrogen for food freezing
air products believes that it is the largest liquefier of hydrogen which it
supplies to many customers including the national aeronautics and space
administration for its space shuttle program

         the global healthcare business of air products is directed at two main
markets institutional and homecare the institutional market uses medical gases
in hospitals clinics and nursing homes as well as helium for use in magnetic
resonance imaging the homecare business was principally in europe before the
acquisition in october 2002 of american homecare supply llc which serves the
eastern united states homecare involves the delivery of respiratory therapy
services infusion services and home medical equipment to patients in their
homes

         specialty gases include fluorine products rare gases such as xenon
krypton and neon and more common gases of high purity or gases that are
precisely blended as mixtures specialty chemicals for use by the electronics
industry include silane arsine silicon tetrafluoride nitrogen trifluoride
carbon tetrafluoride hexafluoromethane and tungsten hexafluoride these gases
and chemicals are used in numerous industries and in electronic and laboratory
applications in certain circumstances the company sells equipment related to
the use handling and storage of such specialty gases and specialty chemicals

         sales of industrial gases and sales of specialty products to the
electronics industry and others are made principally through regional offices in
the united states and other countries

         electricity and hydrocarbons including natural gas as a feedstock for
producing certain gases are important to air products gas business see raw
materials and energy the companys large truck fleet that delivers products to
liquid bulk customers requires a readily available supply of gasoline or diesel
fuel also environmental and health laws and regulations will continue to
affect the companys gas businesses see environmental controls

technology development

         air products conducts research and development principally in its
laboratories located in trexlertown pennsylvania as well as in basingstoke
london and crewe in the uk burghausen germany utrecht the netherlands
san juan del rio mexico and barcelona spain the company also funds and works
closely on research and development programs with a number of major universities
and conducts a sizable amount of research work funded by others principally the
united states government

         the companys marketoriented approach to technology development
encompasses research and development and engineering as well as commercial
development

         the amount expended by the company on research and development during
fiscal year 2002 was 121 million 123 million in fiscal year 2001 and 124
million in fiscal year 2000 the amount expended by the company on
customersponsored research activities during fiscal year 2002 was 18 million
19 million in fiscal year 2001 and 14 million in fiscal year 2000

         in the gases and equipment segments technology development is directed
primarily to developing new and improved processes and equipment for the
production and delivery of industrial gases and cryogenic fluids developing new
products and developing new and improved applications for industrial gases it
is through such applications and improvements that the company has become a
major supplier to the electronics and chemical process industries including
gases from air separation specialty gases and hydrogen additionally
technology development for the equipment business is directed primarily to
reducing the capital and operating costs of its facilities and to
commercializing new technologies in gas production and separation

         in the chemicals segment technology development is primarily concerned
with new products and applications to strengthen and extend our present
positions in polymer and performance materials in addition a major continuing
effort supports the development of new and improved process and manufacturing
technology for chemical intermediates and polymers

         a corporate research group supports the research efforts of the
companys various businesses this group includes the companys corporate
science and technology center which conducts research in areas important to the
longterm growth of the company with focus on performance materials

         as of 1 november 2002 air products owned 952 united states patents and
1695 foreign patents the company is also licensed under certain patents owned
by others while the patents and licenses are considered important air products
does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any
particular patent or patent license or group of patents or licenses

raw materials and energy

         the company manufactures hydrogen carbon monoxide synthesis gas
carbon dioxide and methanol principally from natural gas such products
accounted for approximately 12 of the companys consolidated sales in fiscal
year 2002 the companys principal raw material purchases are chemical
intermediates produced by others from basic petrochemical feedstocks such as
olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons these feedstocks are generally derived from
various crude oil fractions or from liquids extracted from natural gas the
company purchases its chemical intermediates from many sources and generally is
not dependent on one supplier however with respect to vinyl acetate monomer
that supports the polymer business the company is heavily dependent on a single
supplier under a longterm contract that produces vinyl acetate monomer from
several facilities the company characterizes the availability of these chemical
intermediates as generally being readily available the company uses such raw
materials in the production of emulsions amines polyurethane intermediates
specialty additives polyurethane additives and epoxy additives such products
accounted for approximately 28 of the companys consolidated sales in fiscal
year 2002 natural gas is an energy source at a number of the companys
facilities the company also purchases ammonia under longterm contracts as a
feedstock for several of its chemicals facilities

         a longterm supplier of sulfuric acid used in the production of
dinitrotoluene dnt has been operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
since 8 may 2001 the companys dnt operation in its polyurethane intermediates
business and supply to its customers have not been materially impacted the
company expects this supplier to be successful in its reorganization if
reorganization is not successful the sales and profitability of the chemicals
segment could be materially impacted on an annual basis due to the

                                       5

suppliers shutdown and the companys inability to supply all of its customers
base requirements the company extended an 80 million line of credit to this
supplier of which 75 million was drawn at 30 september 2002 the company also
entered into a product prepayment agreement with this supplier at 30 september
2002 the unamortized balance was 50 million the company expects to fully
recover these advances

         the companys industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of
electrical power electricity is the largest cost input for the production of
atmospheric gases any shortage of electrical power or interruption of its
supply or increase in its price that cannot be passed through to customers for
competitive reasons will adversely affect the liquid bulk gas business of the
company

         in addition the company purchases finished and semifinished materials
and chemical intermediates from many suppliers during fiscal year 2002 no
significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of
energy or raw materials

environmental controls

         the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in
the united states and foreign countries where it has operations compliance with
these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs
additionally from time to time the company is involved in proceedings under
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the
federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation and
recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for
investigation and possible cleanup additional information with respect to these
proceedings is included under item 3 legal proceedings below the companys
accounting policies on environmental expenditures are discussed in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein

         the amounts charged to earnings on an aftertax basis related to
environmental matters totaled 24 million in 2002 22 million in 2001 and 31
million in 2000 these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance
with environmental laws as well as remedial activities and costs incurred to
meet internal company standards such costs are estimated to be 25 million in
2003 and 2004

         although precise amounts are difficult to define the company estimates
that in fiscal year 2002 it spent approximately 14 million on capital projects
to control pollution versus 13 million in 2001 capital expenditures to control
pollution in future years are estimated at approximately 19 million in 2003 and
16 million in 2004

         to the extent longterm contracts have been entered into for supply of
product such as for the industrial gas onsite business and for certain
chemical products the cost of any environmental compliance generally is
contractually passed through to the customer

         it is the companys policy to accrue environmental investigatory and
noncapital remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated
the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 9 million to a
reasonably possible upper exposure of 20 million the balance sheet at 30
september 2002 includes an accrual of 15 million at 30 september 2001 the
balance sheet accrual was 14 million

         actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the
estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company
does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental
matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a
materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in
any one year

competition

         the companys businesses face strong competition from others some of
which are larger and have greater resources than air products

         air products industrial gas business competes in the united states
with three major sellers and with several regional sellers competition in
industrial gas markets is based primarily on price reliability of supply and
furnishing or developing applications for use of such gases by customers and in
some cases the provisions of other services or products such as power and steam
generation similar competitive situations exist in



                                       6

european and asian industrial gas markets in which the company competes against
one or more larger entrenched competitors in most countries

         competition in the institutional market of the global healthcare
business is principally from other large established industrial gas companies
using business models longterm product supply agreements that are similar to
those the companies utilize for other industrial gas supply relationships
competition in this market is principally based on price quality service and
reliability of supply homecare is served by national and local providers and
in the us there are over 2000 regional and local providers it is highly
competitive in the united states reimbursement levels are established by fee
schedules regulated by medicare and medicaid or by the levels determined by
insurance companies accordingly in the united states homecare companies
compete primarily on the basis of service homecare companies generally direct
their marketing efforts towards referral sources that usually have no financial
responsibility for the payment of client services maintaining competitiveness
requires efficient logistics reimbursement and accounts receivable systems
although the company intends to acquire additional homecare companies there is
no guarantee that suitable candidates can be acquired or that the necessary
managed care contracts will be on favorable terms

         the number of the companys principal competitors in the chemicals
business varies from product to product and it is not practical to identify
such competitors because of the broad range of the companys chemical products
and the markets served although the company believes it has a leading or strong
market position in most of its chemical products for amines the competition is
principally from other large chemical companies that also have the ability to
provide competitive pricing reliability of supply technical service
assistance and quality products and services the possibility of back
integration by large customers is the major competitive factor for the sale of
polyurethane additives in its other chemical products the company competes
with a large number of chemical companies some of which are larger possess
greater financial resources and are more vertically integrated than the
company competition in these products is principally on the basis of price
quality product performance reliability of product supply and technical
service assistance

         the companys equipment business competes in all aspects with a great
number of firms some of which have greater financial resources than air
products another important factor in certain export sales is financing provided
by governmental entities in the united states and the united kingdom as compared
with financing offered by their counterparts in other countries competition is
based primarily on technological performance service technical knowhow
price and performance guarantees air products believes that its comprehensive
project development capability operating experience engineering and financing
capabilities and construction management experience will enable it to compete
effectively

insurance

         the companys policy is to obtain public liability and property
insurance coverage that is currently available at what management determines to
be a fair and reasonable price the company for itself and its power generation
and flue gas treatment joint venture affiliates for which it assumes operating
responsibility maintains public liability and property insurance coverage at
amounts that management believes are sufficient after retention to meet the
companys anticipated needs in light of historical experience to cover future
litigation and claims there is no assurance however that the company will not
incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the coverage of its insurance

employees

         on 30 september 2002 the company including majorityowned
subsidiaries had approximately 17200 fulltime employees of whom
approximately 8700 were located outside the united states the company has
collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations that expire
on various dates over the next three to four years  on 22 november 2002
the agreement with the international association of machinists and aerospace
workers iamaw expired without ratification of a new agreement although
employees continue to work this collective bargaining arrangement covers
employees at the companys hometown pennsylvania facility which produces
specialty gases and chemicals and employees at two small equipment
manufacturing facilities the company considers relations with its employees to
be satisfactory the company does not believe that the impact of any expiring
or expired collective bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse
impact on the company

          the principal industrial gases sold by the company are oxygen
nitrogen argon primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air
hydrogen carbon monoxide carbon dioxide purchased purified or recovered
through the processing of natural gas or the byproduct streams from process
plants synthesis gas combined streams of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and
helium purchased or refined from crude helium medical and specialty gases are
manufactured or blended by the company or purchased for resale the gases
segment also includes the companys power generation and flue gas treatment
businesses

          the companys gas business involves two principal modes of supply

          tonnage or onsite supplyfor large volume or tonnage users of
industrial gases a plant is built adjacent to on or near the customers
facilityhence the term onsite alternatively the gases are delivered
through a pipeline from nearby locations supply is generally made under
contracts having terms in excess of three years in numerous areasthe houston
texas ship channel including the port arthur texas area silicon valley
california los angeles california phoenix arizona decatur alabama central
louisiana rotterdam the netherlands korea singapore malaysia and bahia
brazilair products hydrogen oxygen carbon monoxide or nitrogen gas
pipelines serve multiple customers from one or more centrally located plants
industrial gas companies in which the company has less than controlling
interests have pipelines in thailand taiwan and south africa

          merchant supplysmaller volumes of industrial gas products are
delivered to thousands of customers in liquid or gaseous form by tanker trucks
or tube trailers these merchant customers use equipment designed and installed
by air products to store the product near the point of use normally in liquid
state and vaporize the product into gaseous state for their use as needed some
customers are also supplied by small onsite generators using noncryogenic
technology based on adsorption and membrane technology which in certain
circumstances the company sells to its customers merchant customers contract
terms normally are from three to five years merchant gases and various
specialty gases are also delivered in cylinders dewars and lecture bottle
sizes

          oxygen nitrogen argon and hydrogen sold to merchant customers are
usually recovered at large standalone facilities located near industrial
areas or hightech centers or at small noncryogenic generators or are taken
from tonnage plants used primarily to supply tonnage users tonnage plants are
frequently designed to have more capacity than is required by their principal
customer to recover additional product that is liquefied for sale to a merchant
market air products also designs and builds systems for recovering oxygen
hydrogen nitrogen carbon monoxide and low dew point gases using adsorption
technology

and conducts a sizable amount of research work funded by others principally the
united states government

          the companys marketoriented approach to technology development
encompasses research and development and engineering as well as commercial
development

          the amount expended by the company on research and development during

raw materials and energy

          the company manufactures hydrogen carbon monoxide synthesis gas
carbon dioxide and methanol principally from natural gas such products
accounted for approximately 13 of the companys consolidated sales in fiscal
year 2001 the companys principal raw material purchases are chemical
intermediates produced by others from basic petrochemical feedstocks such as
olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons these feedstocks are generally derived from
various crude oil fractions or from liquids extracted from natural gas the
company purchases its chemical intermediates from many sources and generally is
not dependent on one supplier however with respect to vinyl acetate monomer
which supports the polymer business the company is heavily dependent on a
single supplier under a longterm contract which produces vinyl acetate monomer
from several facilities the company characterizes the availability of these
chemical intermediates as generally being readily available the company uses
such raw materials in the production of emulsions amines polyurethane
intermediates specialty additives polyurethane additives and epoxy additives
such products accounted for approximately 28 of the companys consolidated
sales in fiscal year 2001 natural gas is an energy source at a number of the
companys facilities the company also purchases ammonia under longterm
contracts as a feedstock for several of its chemicals facilities

          the companys industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of
electrical power any shortage of electrical power or interruption of its supply
or increase in its price which cannot be passed through to customers for
competitive reasons will adversely affect the merchant gas business of the
company

          in addition the company purchases finished and semifinished
materials and chemical intermediates from many suppliers during fiscal year
2001 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies
of energy or raw materials

environmental controls

          the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations
in the united states and foreign countries where it has operations compliance
with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and
costs additionally from time to time the company is involved in proceedings
under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act
the federal superfund law similar state laws and the resource conservation
and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for
investigation and possible cleanup additional information with respect to these
proceedings is included under item 3 legal proceedings below the companys
accounting policies on environmental expenditures are discussed in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements included under item 8 herein

          the amounts charged to earnings on an aftertax basis related to
environmental protection totaled 21 million in 2001 30 million in 2000 and
27 million in 1999 these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for
compliance with environmental laws as well as remedial activities and costs
incurred to meet internal company standards such costs are estimated to be
24 million in 2002 and 2003

          although precise amounts are difficult to define the company
estimates that in fiscal year 2001 it spent approximately 11 million on capital
projects to control pollution versus 3 million in 2000 capital expenditures to
control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately 16 million in
2002 and 13 million in 2003

          to the extent longterm contracts have been entered into for supply of
product such as for the industrial gas onsite business and for certain
chemical products the cost of any environmental compliance generally is
contractually passed through to the customer

          it is the companys policy to accrue environmental investigatory and
noncapital remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated
the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from 9 million to a
reasonably possible upper exposure of 19 million the balance sheet at
september 30 2001 includes an accrual of 14 million at september 30 2000
the balance sheet accrual was 17 million



                                       6
page

          in addition to the environmental exposures discussed in the preceding
paragraph there will be spending at a companyowned manufacturing site where
the company is undertaking rcra remediation action the company estimates
capital costs to implement the anticipated remedial program should not exceed
33 million spending was 28 million through fiscal year 2001 and is estimated
at 3 million for fiscal year 2002 and 2 million for fiscal year 2003
operating and maintenance expenses associated with continuing the remedial
program were minimal in fiscal year 2001 and are estimated to be
approximately 1 million per year for an estimated period of up to 30 years a
former owner and operator at the site has agreed to reimburse the company
approximately 20 of the costs incurred in the remediation reimbursement of
3 million and 14 million was received in fiscal years 2001 and 2000
respectively and the reimbursement is estimated at 2 million for fiscal year
2002 in fiscal year 1999 an insurance recovery related to this environmental
site was received in the amount of 77 million the cost estimates have not
been reduced by the value of such reimbursements and insurance recovery

          actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the
estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company
does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental
matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a
materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in
any one year

competition

          the companys businesses face strong competition from others some of
which are larger and have greater resources than air products

          air products gas business competes in the united states with three
major sellers and with several regional sellers competition in industrial gas
markets is based primarily on price reliability of supply and furnishing or
developing applications for use of such gases by customers and in some cases
the provisions of other services or products such as power and steam generation
a similar competitive situation exists in european industrial gas markets in
which the company competes against one or more larger entrenched competitors in
most countries

          the number of the companys principal competitors in the chemicals
business varies from product to product and it is not practical to identify
such competitors because of the broad range of the companys chemical products
and the markets served although the company believes it has a leading or strong
market position in most of its chemical products for amines the competition is
principally from other large chemical companies that also have the ability to
provide competitive pricing reliability of supply technical service
assistance and quality products and services the possibility of back
integration by large customers is the major competitive factor for the sale of
polyurethane additives in its other chemical products the company competes
with a large number of chemical companies some of which are larger possess
greater financial resources and are more vertically integrated than the
company competition in these products is principally on the basis of price
quality product performance reliability of product supply and technical
service assistance

          the companys equipment business competes in all aspects with a great
number of firms some of which have greater financial resources than air
products another important factor in certain export sales is financing provided
by governmental entities in the united states and the united kingdom as compared
with financing offered by their counterparts in other countries

          competition is based primarily on technological performance service
technical knowhow price and performance guarantees air products believes
that its comprehensive project development capability operating experience
engineering and financing capabilities and construction management experience
will enable it to compete effectively

insurance

          the companys policy is to obtain public liability and property
insurance coverage that is currently available at what management determines to
be a fair and reasonable price the company for itself and its power generation
and flue gas treatment joint venture affiliates for which it assumes operating
responsibility maintains public liability and property insurance coverage at
amounts which management believes are sufficient after retention to meet the
companys anticipated needs in light of historical experience to cover future
litigation and claims there is no assurance however that the company will not
incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the coverage of its insurance

employees

on september 30 2001 the company including majorityowned subsidiaries had
approximately 17800 fulltime employees of whom approximately 7700 were
located outside the united states the company has collective bargaining
agreements with unions at numerous locations which expire on various dates over
the next three to four years the company considers relations with its employees
to be satisfactory the company does not believe that any expiring collective
bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse impact on the company
